The motion shall point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the order of the committee is not obeyed within ten days after notice of the order or within such other time as the committee may fix, the committee may dismiss the action, or make such order as it deems just.

Notwithstanding such failure, the burden is upon contestant to prove that the election results entitle him to contestee’s seat.
