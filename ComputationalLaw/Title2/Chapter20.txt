 Enforcing discretionary spending limits
(a)
 Enforcement
(1)
 Sequestration
Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any, within any category.






(2)
 Eliminating a breach
Each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category.






(3)
 Military personnel
If the President uses the authority to exempt any personnel account from sequestration under 
section 905(f) of this title
, each account within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which the authority provided under 
section 905(f) of this title
 has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.






(4)
 Part-year appropriations
If, on the date specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from—
(A)
 the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and




(B)
 when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation for that account.






(5)
 Look-back
If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), the discretionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.






(6)
 Within-session sequestration
If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through (4).






(7)
 Estimates
(A)
 CBO estimates
As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year, if any, and the budget year provided by that legislation.






(B)
 OMB estimates and explanation of differences
Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing the CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year, if any, and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates. If during the preparation of the report OMB determines that there is a significant difference between OMB and CBO, OMB shall consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding that difference and that consultation shall include, to the extent practicable, written communication to those committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before the issuance of the report.






(C)
 Assumptions and guidelines
OMB estimates under this paragraph shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO, and OMB.






(D)
 Annual appropriations
For purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations shall include any discretionary appropriations for the current year, if any, and the budget year in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation that result from previously enacted legislation.








(b)
 Adjustments to discretionary spending limits
(1)
 Concepts and definitions
When the President submits the budget under 
section 1105 of title 31
, OMB shall calculate and the budget shall include adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. Such changes shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions, minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes. Such changes may only be made after consultation with the Committees on Appropriations and the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, and that consultation shall include written communication to such committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before official action is taken with respect to such changes.






(2)
 Sequestration reports
When OMB submits a sequestration report under section 904(e), (f), or (g) of this title for a fiscal year, OMB shall calculate, and the sequestration report and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under 
section 1105(a) of title 31
 shall include 
1
1
 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma.
 adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year, as follows:

(i)
 the Congress designates as emergency requirements in statute on an account by account basis and the President subsequently so designates, or




(ii)
 the Congress designates for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism in statute on an account by account basis and the President subsequently so designates,





the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism, as applicable.




(B)
 Continuing disability reviews and redeterminations
(i)
 If a bill or joint resolution making appropriations for a fiscal year is enacted that specifies an amount for continuing disability reviews under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq., 1381 et seq.] and for the cost associated with conducting redeterminations of eligibility under title XVI of the Social Security Act, then the adjustments for that fiscal year shall be the additional new budget authority provided in that Act for such expenses for that fiscal year, but shall not exceed—
(I)

 Enforcement of budget goal
 Enforcing pay-as-you-go
(a)
 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to assure that any legislation enacted before 
October 1, 2002
, affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit will trigger an offsetting sequestration.




(b)
 Sequestration
(1)
 Timing
Not later than 15 calendar days after the date Congress adjourns to end a session and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 or 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted before 
October 1, 2002
, as calculated under paragraph (2).






(2)
 Calculation of deficit increase
OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit increase or decrease by adding—
(A)
 all OMB estimates for the budget year of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) of this section;




(B)
 the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to the budget year resulting from the prior year’s sequestration under this section or 
section 903 of this title
, if any, as published in OMB’s final sequestration report for that prior year; and




(C)
 any net deficit increase or decrease in the current year resulting from all OMB estimates for the current year of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) of this section that were not reflected in the final OMB sequestration report for the current year.






(c)
 Eliminating a deficit increase
(1)
 The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) of this section shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:
(A)
 First
All reductions in automatic spending increases specified in section 906(a) 
1
1
 See References in Text note below.
 of this title shall be made.






(B)
 Second
If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, the maximum reductions permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed and direct student loans) and 906(c) 
1
 of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.






(C)
 Third
(i)
 If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt direct spending account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in direct spending required by subsection (b); except that the medicare programs specified in 
section 906(d) of this title
 shall not be reduced by more than 4 percent and the uniform percentage applicable to all other direct spending programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in direct spending.




(ii)
 For purposes of determining reductions under clause (i), outlay reductions (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.








(2)
 For purposes of this subsection, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline.




(d)
 Estimates
(1)
 CBO estimates
As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation, CBO shall provide an estimate to OMB of that legislation.






(2)
 OMB estimates
Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing—
(A)
 the CBO estimate of that legislation;




(B)
 an OMB estimate of that legislation using current economic and technical assumptions; and




(C)
 an explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates.






(3)
 Significant differences
If during the preparation of the report under paragraph (2) OMB determines that there is a significant difference between the OMB and CBO estimates, OMB shall consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding that difference and that consultation, to the extent practicable, shall include written communication to such committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before the issuance of that report.






(4)
 Scope of estimates
The estimates under this section shall include the amount of change in outlays or receipts for the current year (if applicable), the budget year, and each outyear excluding any amounts resulting from—
(A)
 full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect under current estimates; and




(B)
 emergency provisions as designated under subsection (e) of this section.






(5)
 Scorekeeping guidelines
OMB and CBO, after consultation with each other and the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall—
(A)
 determine common scorekeeping guidelines; and




(B)
 in conformance with such guidelines, prepare estimates under this section.






(e)
 Emergency legislation
If a provision of direct spending or receipts legislation is enacted that the President designates as an emergency requirement and that the Congress so designates in statute, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and receipts in all fiscal years resulting from that provision shall be designated as an emergency requirement in the reports required under subsection (d) of this section. This subsection shall not apply to direct spending provisions to cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.




 Enforcing deficit targets
(a)
 Sequestration
Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under 
section 901 of this title
 and 
section 902 of this title
, but after any sequestration required by 
section 901 of this title
 (enforcing discretionary spending limits) or 
section 902 of this title
 (enforcing pay-as-you-go), there shall be a sequestration to eliminate the excess deficit (if any remains) if it exceeds the margin.




(b)
 Excess deficit; margin
The excess deficit is, if greater than zero, the estimated deficit for the budget year, minus—
(1)
 the maximum deficit amount for that year;




(2)
 the amounts for that year designated as emergency direct spending or receipts legislation under 
section 902(e) of this title
; and




(3)
 for any fiscal year in which there is not a full adjustment for technical and economic reestimates, the deposit insurance reestimate for that year, if any, calculated under subsection (h) of this section.





The “margin” for fiscal year 1992 or 1993 is zero and for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is $15,000,000,000.


(c)
 Dividing sequestration
To eliminate the excess deficit in a budget year, half of the required outlay reductions shall be obtained from non-exempt defense accounts (accounts designated as function 050 in the President’s fiscal year 1991 budget submission) and half from non-exempt, non-defense accounts (all other non-exempt accounts).




(d)
 Defense
Each non-exempt defense account shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to carry out subsection (c) of this section, except that, if any military personnel are exempt, adjustments shall be made under the procedure set forth in 
section 901(a)(3) of this title
.




(e)
 Non-defense
Actions to reduce non-defense accounts shall be taken in the following order:
(1)
 First
All reductions in automatic spending increases under section 906(a) 
1
1
 See References in Text note below.
 of this title shall be made.






(2)
 Second
If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, the maximum reduction permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed student loans) and 906(c) 
1
 of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.






(3)
 Third
(A)
 If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt, non-defense account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in non-defense outlays required by subsection (c) of this section, except that—
(i)
 the medicare program specified in 
section 906(d) of this title
 shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total including any reduction of less than 2 percent made under 
section 902 of this title
 or, if it has been reduced by 2 percent or more under 
section 902 of this title
, it may not be further reduced under this section; and




(ii)
 the health programs set forth in 
section 906(e) of this title
 shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total (including any reduction made under 
section 901 of this title
),





and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this subsection shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in non-defense outlays.




(B)
 For purposes of determining reductions under subparagraph (A), outlay reduction (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.






(f)
 Baseline assumptions; part-year appropriations
(1)
 Budget assumptions
For purposes of subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline minus any reductions required to be made under sections 901 and 902 of this title.






(2)
 Part-year appropriations
If, on the date specified in subsection (a) of this section, there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any non-exempt budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, shall be subtracted from—
(A)
 the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and




(B)
 when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation; except that the amount to be sequestered from that account shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the savings achieved by that appropriation when the enacted amount is less than the baseline for that account.






(g)
 Adjustments to maximum deficit amounts
(1)
 Adjustments
(A)
 When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1992, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions. When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1993, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be further adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions.




(B)
 When submitting the budget for fiscal year 1994, the President may choose to adjust the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions. If the President chooses to adjust the maximum deficit amount when submitting the fiscal year 1994 budget, the President may choose to invoke the same adjustment procedure when submitting the budget for fiscal year 1995. In each case, the President must choose between making no adjustment or the full adjustment described in paragraph (2). If the President chooses to make that full adjustment, then those procedures for adjusting discretionary spending limits described in sections 901(b)(1)(C) 
1
 and 901(b)(2)(E) 
1
 of this title, otherwise applicable through fiscal year 1993 or 1994 (as the case may be), shall be deemed to apply for fiscal year 1994 (and 1995 if applicable).




(C)
 When the budget for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is submitted and the sequestration reports for those years under 
section 904 of this title
 are made (as applicable), if the President does not choose to make the adjustments set forth in subparagraph (B), the maximum deficit amount for that fiscal year shall be adjusted by the amount of the adjustment to discretionary spending limits first applicable for that year (if any) under 
section 901(b) of this title
.




(D)
 For each fiscal year the adjustments required to be made with the submission of the President’s budget for that year shall also be made when OMB submits the sequestration update report and the final sequestration report for that year, but OMB shall continue to use the economic and technical assumptions in the President’s budget for that year.





Each adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the maximum deficit amounts set forth in section 665 
1
 of this title.




(2)
 Calculations of adjustments
The required increase or decrease shall be calculated as follows:
(A)
 The baseline deficit or surplus shall be calculated using up-to-date economic and technical assumptions, using up-to-date concepts and definitions, and, in lieu of the baseline levels of discretionary appropriations, using the discretionary spending limits set forth in section 665 
1
 of this title as adjusted under 
section 901 of this title
.




(B)
 The net deficit increase or decrease caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after 
November 5, 1990
 (after adjusting for any sequestration of direct spending accounts) shall be calculated for each fiscal year by adding—
(i)
 the estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under 
section 902(d) of this title
 applicable to each such fiscal year; and




(ii)
 the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to each such fiscal year resulting from the prior year’s sequestration under this section or 
section 902 of this title
 of direct spending, if any, as contained in OMB’s final sequestration report for that year.






(C)
 The amount calculated under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (A).




(D)
 The maximum deficit amount set forth in section 665 
1
 of this title shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (C).




(E)
 The amount calculated under subparagraph (D) shall be the amount of the adjustment required by paragraph (1).






(h)
 Treatment of deposit insurance
(1)
 Initial estimates
The initial estimates of the net costs of federal deposit insurance for fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 (assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of the submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993) shall be set forth in that budget.






(2)
 Reestimates
For fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995, the amount of the reestimate of deposit insurance costs shall be calculated by subtracting the amount set forth under paragraph (1) for that year from the current estimate of deposit insurance costs (but assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993).

(k)
 Effects of sequestration
The effects of sequestration shall be as follows:
(1)
 Budgetary resources sequestered from any account shall be permanently cancelled, except as provided in paragraph (6).




(2)
 Except as otherwise provided, the same percentage sequestration shall apply to all programs, projects, and activities within a budget account (with programs, projects, and activities as delineated in the appropriation Act or accompanying report for the relevant fiscal year covering that account, or for accounts not included in appropriation Acts, as delineated in the most recently submitted President’s budget).




(3)
 Administrative regulations or similar actions implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 days of the sequestration order. To the extent that formula allocations differ at different levels of budgetary resources within an account, program, project, or activity, the sequestration shall be interpreted as producing a lower total appropriation, with the remaining amount of the appropriation being obligated in a manner consistent with program allocation formulas in substantive law.




(4)
 Except as otherwise provided, obligations in sequestered accounts shall be reduced only in the fiscal year in which a sequester occurs.




(5)
 If an automatic spending increase is sequestered, the increase (in the applicable index) that was disregarded as a result of that sequestration shall not be taken into account in any subsequent fiscal year.




(6)
 Budgetary resources sequestered in revolving, trust, and special fund accounts and offsetting collections sequestered in appropriation accounts shall not be available for obligation during the fiscal year in which the sequestration occurs, but shall be available in subsequent years to the extent otherwise provided in law.




 The baseline
(a)
 In general
For any budget year, the baseline refers to a projection of current-year levels of new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and the surplus or deficit into the budget year and the outyears based on laws enacted through the applicable date.




(b)
 Direct spending and receipts
For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions:
(1)
 In general
Laws providing or creating direct spending and receipts are assumed to operate in the manner specified in those laws for each such year and funding for entitlement authority is assumed to be adequate to make all payments required by those laws.






(2)
 Exceptions
(A)
(i)
 No program established by a law enacted on or before 
August 5, 1997
, with estimated current year outlays greater than $50,000,000 shall be assumed to expire in the budget year or the outyears. The scoring of new programs with estimated outlays greater than $50,000,000 a year shall be based on scoring by the Committees on Budget or OMB, as applicable. OMB, CBO, and the Budget Committees shall consult on the scoring of such programs where there are differences between CBO and OMB.




(ii)
 On the expiration of the suspension of a provision of law that is suspended under 
section 7301 of title 7
 and that authorizes a program with estimated fiscal year outlays that are greater than $50,000,000, for purposes of clause (i), the program shall be assumed to continue to operate in the same manner as the program operated immediately before the expiration of the suspension.






(B)
 The increase for veterans’ compensation for a fiscal year is assumed to be the same as that required by law for veterans’ pensions unless otherwise provided by law enacted in that session.




(C)
 Excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund, if expiring, are assumed to be extended at current rates.




(D)
 If any law expires before the budget year or any outyear, then any program with estimated current year outlays greater than $50,000,000 that operates under that law shall be assumed to continue to operate under that law as in effect immediately before its expiration.






(3)
 Hospital Insurance Trust Fund
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and disbursements of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund shall be included in all calculations required by this Act.






(c)
 Discretionary appropriations
For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions regarding all amounts other than those covered by subsection (b) of this section:
(1)
 Inflation of current-year appropriations
Budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level provided for the budget year in full-year appropriation Acts. If for any account a full-year appropriation has not yet been enacted, budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level available in the current year, adjusted sequentially and cumulatively for expiring housing contracts as specified in paragraph (2), for social insurance administrative expenses as specified in paragraph (3), to offset pay absorption and for pay annualization as specified in paragraph (4), for inflation as specified in paragraph (5), and to account for changes required by law in the level of agency payments for personnel benefits other than pay.






(2)
 Expiring housing contracts
New budget authority to renew expiring multiyear subsidized housing contracts shall be adjusted to reflect the difference in the number of such contracts that are scheduled to expire in that fiscal year and the number expiring in the current year, with the per-contract renewal cost equal to the average current-year cost of renewal contracts.






(3)
 Social insurance administrative expenses
Budgetary resources for the administrative expenses of the following trust funds shall be adjusted by the percentage change in the beneficiary population from the current year to that fiscal year: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the railroad retirement account.






(4)
 Pay annualization; offset to pay absorption
Current-year new budget authority for Federal employees shall be adjusted to reflect the full 12-month costs (without absorption) of any pay adjustment that occurred in that fiscal year.






(5)
 Inflators
The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust budgetary resources relating to personnel shall be the percent by which the average of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (wages and salaries, private industry workers) for that fiscal year differs from such index for the current year. The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust all other budgetary resources shall be the percent by which the average of the estimated gross domestic product chain-type price index for that fiscal year differs from the average of such estimated index for the current year.






(6)
 Current-year appropriations
If, for any account, a continuing appropriation is in effect for less than the entire current year, then the current-year amount shall be assumed to equal the amount that would be available if that continuing appropriation covered the entire fiscal year. If law permits the transfer of budget authority among budget accounts in the current year, the current-year level for an account shall reflect transfers accomplished by the submission of, or assumed for the current year in, the President’s original budget for the budget year.






(d)
 Up-to-date concepts
In deriving the baseline for any budget year or outyear, current-year amounts shall be calculated using the concepts and definitions that are required for that budget year.




(e)
 Asset sales
Amounts realized from the sale of an asset shall not be included in estimates under section 901, 902, or 903 of this title if that sale would result in a financial cost to the Federal Government as determined pursuant to scorekeeping guidelines.

. For purposes of this paragraph, an amendment shall be considered to be relevant if it relates to function 050 (national defense).

 On or after the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolution is placed on the Senate calendar, notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the Senate, including Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution. The motion is not in order after the eighth calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after such joint resolution is placed on the appropriate calendar. The motion is not debatable. The joint resolution is privileged in the Senate. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order.

In the Senate, an amendment, any amendment to an amendment, or any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover and the majority leader (or their designees), except that in the event that the majority leader favors the amendment, motion, or appeal, the minority leader (or the minority leader’s designee) shall control the time in opposition to the amendment, motion, or appeal.




(2)
 In the Senate, an amendment that is otherwise in order shall be in order notwithstanding the fact that it amends the joint resolution in more than one place or amends language previously amended, so long as the amendment makes or maintains mathematical consistency.

(3)
 It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any amendment to any joint resolution introduced under subsection (d) of this section or any conference report thereon if such amendment or conference report would have the effect of decreasing any specific budget outlay reductions below the level of such outlay reductions provided in such joint resolution unless such amendment or conference report makes a reduction in other specific budget outlays at least equivalent to any increase in outlays provided by such amendment or conference report.

 Reporting of resolutions and reconciliation bills and resolutions, in Senate
(1)
 Committee alternatives to Presidential order
After the submission of an OMB sequestration update report under

section 632(d) of this title
 with respect to alternatives to the order envisioned by such report insofar as such order affects laws within the jurisdiction of the committee.






(2)
 Initial Budget Committee action
After the submission of such a report, the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may, not later than October 15, report to the Senate a resolution.

, sufficient to achieve at least the total level of deficit reduction contained in those sections which are not affirmed.






(3)
 Response of committees
Committees instructed pursuant to paragraph (2), or affected thereby, shall submit their responses to the Budget Committee no later than 10 days after the resolution referred to in paragraph (2) is agreed to, except that if only one such Committee is so instructed such Committee shall, by the same date, report to the Senate a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution containing its recommendations in response to such instructions. A committee shall be considered to have complied with all instructions to it pursuant to a resolution adopted under paragraph (2) if it has made recommendations with respect to matters within its jurisdiction which would result in a reduction in the deficit at least equal to the total reduction directed by such instructions.






(4)
 Budget Committee action
Upon receipt of the recommendations received in response to a resolution referred to in paragraph (2), the Budget Committee shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution, or both, carrying out all such recommendations without any substantive revisions. In the event that a committee instructed in a resolution referred to in paragraph (2) fails to submit any recommendation (or, when only one committee is instructed, fails to report a reconciliation bill or resolution) in response to such instructions, the Budget Committee shall include in the reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported pursuant to this subparagraph legislative language within the jurisdiction of the noncomplying committee to achieve the amount of deficit reduction directed in such instructions.






(5)
 Point of order
It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any reconciliation bill or reconciliation resolution reported under paragraph (4) with respect to a fiscal year, any amendment thereto, or any conference report thereon if—

 the enactment of such bill or resolution as reported;




(B)
 the adoption and enactment of such amendment; or




(C)
 the enactment of such bill or resolution in the form recommended in such conference report,





would cause the amount of the deficit for such fiscal year to exceed the maximum deficit amount for such fiscal year, unless the low-growth report submitted under 
section 904 of this title
 projects negative real economic growth for such fiscal year, or for each of any two consecutive quarters during such fiscal year.




(6)
 Treatment of certain amendments
In the Senate, an amendment which adds to a resolution reported under paragraph (2) an instruction of the type referred to in such paragraph shall be in order during the consideration of such resolution if such amendment would be in order but for the fact that it would be held to be non-germane on the basis that the instruction constitutes new matter.
