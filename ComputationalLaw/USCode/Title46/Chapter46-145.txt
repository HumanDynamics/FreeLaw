Chapter 145
REGULATORY MEASUREMENT
 Application
 Measurement
The Secretary shall measure a vessel to which this chapter applies in the way provided by this chapter.
 Certificate of measurement
(a)
 The Secretary shall prescribe the certificate to be issued as evidence of a vessel’s measurement under this chapter.


(b)
 The certificate shall be maintained as required by the Secretary.


 Remeasurement
(a)
 To the extent necessary, the Secretary shall remeasure a vessel to which this chapter applies if—
(1)
 the Secretary or the owner alleges an error in its measurement;




(2)
 the vessel or the use of its space is changed in a way that substantially affects its tonnage;




(3)
 after being measured under subchapter III of this chapter, the vessel becomes subject to subchapter II of this chapter because the vessel or its use is changed; or




(4)
 although not required to be measured under subchapter II of this chapter, the vessel was measured under subchapter II and the owner requests that the vessel be measured under subchapter III of this chapter.




(b)
 Except as provided in this section and chapter 143 of this title, a vessel that has been measured does not have to be remeasured to obtain another document or endorsement under chapter 121 of this title.


 Application
 Standard tonnage measurement
(a)
 The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for measuring the gross and net tonnages of a vessel under this subchapter. The regulations shall provide for tonnages comparable to the tonnages that could have been assigned under sections 4151 and 4153 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as sections 4151 and 4153 existed immediately before the enactment of this section.


(b)
 On application of the owner or master of a vessel of the United States used in foreign trade, the Secretary may attach an appendix to the vessel’s register stating the measurement of spaces that may be deducted from gross tonnage under laws and regulations of other countries but not under those of the United States.


 Dual tonnage measurement
(a)
 On application by the owner and approval by the Secretary, the tonnage of spaces prescribed by the Secretary may be excluded in measuring under this section the gross tonnage of a vessel measured under 
section 14512 of this title
. The spaces prescribed by the Secretary shall be comparable to the spaces that could have been excluded under 
section 2 of the Act of September 29, 1965
 (
Public Law 89–219
, 
79 Stat. 891
), as section 2 existed immediately before the enactment of this section.


(b)
 The Secretary shall prescribe the design, location, and dimensions of the tonnage mark to be placed on a vessel measured under this section.


(c)
(1)
 If a vessel is assigned two sets of gross and net tonnages under this section, each certificate stating the vessel’s tonnages shall state the gross and net tonnages when the vessel’s tonnage mark is submerged and when it is not submerged.




(2)
 Except as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, a certificate stating a vessel’s tonnages may state only one set of gross and net tonnages as assigned under this section.




 Reciprocity for foreign vessels
For a foreign vessel not measured under chapter 143, if the Secretary finds that the laws and regulations of a foreign country related to measurement of vessels are substantially similar to those of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter, the Secretary may accept the measurement and certificate of a vessel of that foreign country as complying with this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter.
 Application
This subchapter applies to a vessel described in 
 Measurement
(a)
 In this section, “length” means the horizontal distance of the hull between the foremost part of the stem and the aftermost part of the stern, excluding fittings and attachments.


(b)
(1)
 The Secretary shall assign gross and net tonnages to a vessel based on its length, breadth, depth, other dimensions, and appropriate coefficients.




(2)
 The Secretary shall prescribe the way dimensions (except length) are measured and which coefficients are appropriate.




(c)
 The resulting gross tonnages, taken as a group, reasonably shall reflect the relative internal volumes of the vessels measured under this subchapter. The resulting net tonnages shall be in approximately the same ratios to corresponding gross tonnages as are the net and gross tonnages of comparable vessels measured under subchapter II of this chapter.


(d)
 Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, the Secretary may determine the gross and net tonnages of a vessel representative of a designated class, model, or type, and then assign those gross and net tonnages to other vessels of the same class, model, or type.
