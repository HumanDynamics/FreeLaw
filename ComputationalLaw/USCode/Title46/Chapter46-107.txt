 Duties of masters
(a)
 When a seaman dies during a voyage, the master shall take charge of the seaman’s money and property. An entry shall be made in the official logbook, signed by the master, the chief mate, and an unlicensed crewmember containing an inventory of the money and property and a statement of the wages due the seaman, with the total of the deductions to be made.


(b)
 On compliance with this chapter, the master shall obtain a written certificate of compliance from the consular officer or court clerk. Clearance may be granted to a foreign-bound vessel only when the certificate is received at the office of customs.


 Procedures of masters

 If the vessel is proceeding to the United States when a seaman dies, the master shall deliver the seaman’s money, property, and wages when the agreement required by this part is ended, as provided in 
section 10706 of this title
.


(b)
 If the vessel touches at a foreign port after the death of the seaman, the master shall report to the first available consular officer. The consular officer may require the master to deliver to the officer the money, property, and wages of the seaman. The consular officer shall give the master a receipt for the matters delivered and certify on the agreement the particulars of the delivery. When the agreement ends, the master shall deliver the receipt to a district court of the United States.


(c)
 If the consular officer does not require the master to deliver the seaman’s money, property, and wages, the officer shall so certify on the agreement, and the master shall dispose of the money, property, and wages as provided under 
section 10706 of this title
.


(d)
 A deduction from the account of a deceased seaman is valid only if certified by a proper entry in the official logbook.


 Duties of consular officers
When a seaman dies outside the United States leaving money or property not on board a vessel, the consular officer nearest the place at which the money and property is located shall claim and take charge of it.
 Disposition of money, property, and wages by consular officers
 Seamen dying in the United States
When a seaman dies in the United States and is entitled at death to claim money, property, or wages from the master or owner of a vessel on which the seaman served, the master or owner shall deliver the money, property, and wages to a district court of the United States within one week of the seaman’s death. If the seaman’s death occurs at sea, such money, property, or wages shall be delivered to a district court or a consular officer within one week of the vessel’s arrival at the first port call after the seaman’s death.
 Repealed. 
 Sale of property
A district court of the United States may direct the sale of any part of the property of a deceased seaman. Proceeds of the sale shall be held as wages of the seaman are held.
 Distribution
(a)
(1)
 If the money, property, and wages of a seaman, including proceeds from the sale of property, are not more than $1,500 in value, the court, subject to deductions it allows for expenses and at least 60 days after receiving the money, property, and wages, may deliver the money, property, and wages to a claimant proving to be—
(A)
 the seaman’s surviving spouse or child;




(B)
 entitled to the money, property, and wages under the seaman’s will or under a law or at common law; or




(C)
 entitled to secure probate, or take out letters of administration, although no probate or letters of administration have been issued.






(2)
 The court is released from further liability for the money, property, and wages distributed under paragraph (1) of this subsection.

(b)
 If the money, property, and wages are more than $1,500 in value, the court, subject to deductions for expenses, shall deliver the money, property, and wages to the legal representative of the seaman.


 Unclaimed money, property, and wages

 When a claim for the money, property, or wages of a deceased seaman held by a district court of the United States has not been substantiated within 6 years after their receipt by the court, the court, if a subsequent claim is made, may allow or refuse the claim.


(b)
 If, after money, property, and wages have been held by the court for 6 years, it appears to the court that no claim will have to be satisfied, the property shall be sold. The money and wages and the proceeds from the sale shall be deposited in the Treasury trust fund receipt account “Unclaimed Moneys of Individuals Whose Whereabouts are Unknown”.


 Penalties
An owner or master violating this chapter are each liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of 3 times the value of the seaman’s money, property, and wages involved or, if the value is not determined, of $200.
