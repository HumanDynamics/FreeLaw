 Load line requirements

 The owner, charterer, managing operator, agent, master, and individual in charge of a vessel shall mark and maintain the load lines permanently and conspicuously in the way prescribed by the Secretary.

 A fishing vessel built on or before 
July 1, 2013
, that undergoes a major conversion completed after the later of

 Assignment of load lines
(a)
 The Secretary shall assign load lines for a vessel so that they indicate the minimum safe freeboard to which the vessel may be loaded. However, if the owner requests, the Secretary may assign load lines that result in greater freeboard than the minimum safe freeboard.


(b)
 In assigning load lines for a vessel, the Secretary shall consider—
(1)

(2)
 the geographic area in which the vessel will operate; and




(3)
 applicable international agreements to which the United States Government is a party.




(c)
 An existing vessel may retain its load lines assigned before 
January 1, 1986
, unless the Secretary decides that a substantial change in the vessel after those load lines were assigned requires that new load lines be assigned under this chapter.


(d)
 The minimum freeboard of an existing vessel may be reduced only if the vessel complies with every applicable provision of this chapter.


(e)
 The Secretary may designate by regulation specific geographic areas that have less severe weather or sea conditions and from which there is adequate time to return to available safe harbors. The Secretary may reduce the minimum freeboard of a vessel operating in these areas.


 Load line surveys
(a)
 The Secretary may provide for annual, renewal, and other load line surveys.


(b)
 In conducting a load line survey, the Secretary shall consider whether—

 are adequate to protect the vessel from the sea; and




(B)
 meet other requirements the Secretary may prescribe by regulation;






(2)
 the strength of the hull is adequate for all loading conditions;




(3)
 the stability of the vessel is adequate for all loading conditions;




(4)
 the topsides of the vessel are arranged and constructed to allow rapid overboard drainage of deck water in heavy weather; and




(5)
 the topsides of the vessel are adequate in design, arrangement, and equipment to protect crewmembers performing outside tasks necessary for safe operation of the vessel.




 Load line certificate

(b)
 The certificate shall be maintained as required by the Secretary.


 Delegation of authority

 For a vessel intended to be engaged on a foreign voyage, the Secretary may delegate to another country that is a party to the International Convention on Load Lines, 1966, the authority to assign load lines, survey vessels, determine that the load lines are marked correctly, and issue an International Load Line Certificate (1966).

 The Secretary may terminate a delegation made under this section after giving written notice to the organization.


 Special exemptions

 A certificate of exemption issued under subsection (b) of this section shall be maintained as required by the Secretary.


 Reciprocity for foreign vessels
(a)
 When the Secretary finds that the laws and regulations of a foreign country related to load lines are similar to those of this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter, or when a foreign country is a party to an international load line agreement to which the United States Government is a party, the Secretary shall accept the load line marks and certificate of a vessel of that foreign country as complying with this chapter and the regulations prescribed under this chapter. The Secretary may control the vessel as provided for in the applicable international agreement.


(b)
 Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a vessel of a foreign country that does not recognize load lines assigned under this chapter.


 Submersible vessels
Notwithstanding sections 5103–5105 of this title, the Secretary may prescribe regulations for submersible vessels to provide a minimum level of safety.
