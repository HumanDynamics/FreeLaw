 on a voyage between a port of the United States on the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, shall be provided with a medicine chest.

 A vessel to which 
section 11102 of this title
 applies shall be provided with a slop chest containing sufficient clothing for the intended voyage for each seaman, including—

 boots or shoes;

 everything necessary for the wear of a seaman; and

 a complete supply of tobacco and blankets.




(b)
 Merchandise in the slop chest shall be sold to a seaman desiring it, for the use of the seaman, at a profit of not more than 10 percent of the reasonable wholesale value of the merchandise at the port at which the voyage began.


(c)
 This section does not apply to a vessel on a voyage to Canada, Bermuda, the West Indies, Mexico, or Central America, or a fishing or whaling vessel.


 Destitute seamen
(a)
 A consular officer shall provide, for a destitute seaman of the United States, subsistence and passage to a port of the United States in the most reasonable manner, at the expense of the United States Government and subject to regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State. A seaman, if able, shall be required to perform duties on the vessel giving the seaman passage, in accordance with the seaman’s rating.


(b)
 A master of a vessel of the United States bound to a port of the United States shall take a destitute seaman on board at the request of a consular officer and transport the seaman to the United States. A master refusing to transport a destitute seaman when requested is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $100. The certificate signed and sealed by a consular officer is prima facie evidence of refusal. A master is not required to carry a destitute seaman if the seaman’s presence would cause the number of individuals on board to exceed the number permitted in the certificate of inspection or if the seaman has a contagious disease.


(c)
 Compensation for the transportation of destitute seamen to the United States who are unable to work shall be agreed on by the master and the consular officer, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State. However, the compensation may be not more than the lowest passenger rate of the vessel, or 2 cents a mile, whichever is less.


(d)
 When a master of a vessel of the United States takes on board a destitute seaman unable to work, from a port or place not having a consular officer, for transportation to the United States or to a port at which there is a consular officer, the master or owner of the vessel shall be compensated reasonably under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of State.


 Wages on discharge when vessel sold
(a)
 When a vessel of the United States is sold in a foreign country, the master shall deliver to the consular officer a certified crew list and the agreement required by this part. The master shall pay each seaman the wages due the seaman and provide the seaman with employment on board another vessel of the United States bound for the port of original engagement of the seaman or to another port agreed on. If employment cannot be provided, the master shall—
(1)
 provide the seaman with the means to return to the port of original engagement;




(2)
 provide the seaman passage to the port of original engagement; or




(3)
 deposit with the consular officer an amount of money considered sufficient by the officer to provide the seaman with maintenance and passage home.




(b)
 The consular officer shall endorse on the agreement the particulars of the payment, provision, or deposit made under this section.


(c)
 An owner of a vessel is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $500 if the master does not comply with this section.


 Wages on justifiable complaint of seamen
(a)
 Before a seaman on a vessel of the United States is discharged in a foreign country by a consular officer on the seaman’s complaint that the agreement required by this part has been breached because the vessel is badly provisioned or unseaworthy, or against the officers for cruel treatment, the officer shall inquire about the complaint. If satisfied of the justice of the complaint, the consular officer shall require the master to pay the wages due the seaman plus one month’s additional wages and shall discharge the seaman. The master shall provide the seaman with employment on another vessel or provide the seaman with passage on another vessel to the port of original engagement, to the most convenient port of the United States, or to some port agreeable to the seaman.


(b)
 When a vessel does not have sufficient provisions for the intended voyage, and the seaman has been forced to accept a reduced ration or provisions that are bad in quality or unfit for use, the seaman is entitled to recover from the master or owner an allowance, as additional wages, that the court hearing the case considers reasonable.


(c)
 Subsection (b) of this section does not apply when the reduction in rations was for a period during which the seaman willfully and without sufficient cause failed to perform duties or was lawfully under confinement on board or on shore for misconduct, unless that reduction can be shown to have been unreasonable.


(d)
 Subsection (b) of this section does not apply to a fishing or whaling vessel or a yacht.


 Unlawful engagements void
An engagement of a seaman contrary to a law of the United States is void. A seaman so engaged may leave the service of the vessel at any time and is entitled to recover the highest rate of wages at the port from which the seaman was engaged or the amount agreed to be given the seaman at the time of engagement, whichever is higher.
 Taxes
(a)
 
Withholding
.—
Wages due or accruing to a master or seaman on a vessel in the foreign, coastwise, intercoastal, interstate, or noncontiguous trade or an individual employed on a fishing vessel or any fish processing vessel may not be withheld under the tax laws of a State or a political subdivision of a State. However, this section does not prohibit withholding wages of a seaman on a vessel in the coastwise trade between ports in the same State if the withholding is under a voluntary agreement between the seaman and the employer of the seaman.


(b)
 Liability.—
(1)
 
Limitation on jurisdiction to tax
.—
An individual to whom this subsection applies is not subject to the income tax laws of a State or political subdivision of a State, other than the State and political subdivision in which the individual resides, with respect to compensation for the performance of duties described in paragraph (2).




(2)
 
Application
.—
This subsection applies to an individual—
(A)
 engaged on a vessel to perform assigned duties in more than one State as a pilot licensed under 
section 7101 of this title
 or licensed or authorized under the laws of a State; or




(B)
 who performs regularly assigned duties while engaged as a master, officer, or crewman on a vessel operating on navigable waters in 2 or more States.






 Attachment of wages
(a)
 Wages due or accruing to a master or seaman are not subject to attachment or arrestment from any court, except for an order of a court about the payment by a master or seaman of any part of the master’s or seaman’s wages for the support and maintenance of the spouse or minor children of the master or seaman, or both. A payment of wages to a master or seaman is valid, notwithstanding any prior sale or assignment of wages or any attachment, encumbrance, or arrestment of the wages.


(b)
 An assignment or sale of wages or salvage made before the payment of wages does not bind the party making it, except allotments authorized by 
section 10315 of this title
.


(c)
 This section applies to an individual employed on a fishing vessel or any fish processing vessel.


 Seamen’s clothing
The clothing of a seaman is exempt from attachments and liens. A person detaining a seaman’s clothing shall be fined not more than $500, imprisoned for not more than 6 months, or both.
 Limit on amount recoverable on voyage
When a seaman is on a voyage on which a written agreement is required under this part, not more than $1 is recoverable from the seaman by a person for a debt incurred by the seaman during the voyage for which the seaman is signed on until the voyage is ended.
 Master’s lien for wages
The master of a documented vessel has the same lien against the vessel for the master’s wages and the same priority as any other seaman serving on the vessel.
