Notice and Hearing
.—
(1)
 On filing an application by the United States as provided in this section, the counsel for the United States shall prepare, and the clerk shall issue, a notice for service on the debtor against whom the prejudgment remedy is sought and on any other person whom the United States reasonably believes, after exercising due diligence, has possession, custody, or control of property affected by such remedy. Three copies of the notice shall be served on each such person. The form and content of such notice shall be approved jointly by a majority of the chief judges of the Federal districts in the State in which the court is located and shall be in substantially the following form:
“notice


“You are hereby notified that this [property] is being taken by the United States Government (‘the Government’), which says that [name of debtor] owes it a debt of $ [amount] for [reason for debt] and has filed a lawsuit to collect this debt. The Government says it must take this property at this time because [recite the pertinent ground or grounds from section 3101(b)]. The Government wants to make sure [name of debtor] will pay if the court determines that this money is owed.


“In addition, you are hereby notified that there are exemptions under the law which may protect some of this property from being taken by the Government if [name of debtor] can show that the exemptions apply. Below is a summary of the major exemptions which apply in most situations in the State of [State where property is located]:


“[A statement summarizing in plain and understandable English the election available with respect to such State under section 3014 and the types of property that may be exempted under each of the alternatives specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 3014(a), and a statement that different property may be so exempted with respect to the State in which the debtor resides.]


“If you are [name of debtor] and you disagree with the reason the Government gives for taking your property now, or if you think you do not owe the money to the Government that it says you do, or if you think the property the Government is taking qualifies under one of the above exemptions, you have a right to ask the court to return your property to you.


“If you want a hearing, you must promptly notify the court. You must make your request in writing, and either mail it or deliver it in person to the clerk of the court at [address]. If you wish, you may use this notice to request the hearing by checking the box below and mailing this notice to the court clerk. You must also send a copy of your request to the Government at [address], so the Government will know you want a hearing. The hearing will take place within 5 days after the clerk receives your request, if you ask for it to take place that quickly, or as soon after that as possible.


“At the hearing you may explain to the judge why you think you do not owe the money to the Government, why you disagree with the reason the Government says it must take your property at this time, or why you believe the property the Government has taken is exempt or belongs to someone else. You may make any or all of these explanations as you see fit.


“If you think you live outside the Federal judicial district in which the court is located, you may request, not later than 20 days after you receive this notice, that this proceeding to take your property be transferred by the court to the Federal judicial district in which you reside. You must make your request in writing, and either mail it or deliver it in person to the clerk of the court at [address]. You must also send a copy of your request to the Government at [address], so the Government will know you want the proceeding to be transferred.


“Be sure to keep a copy of this notice for your own records. If you have any questions about your rights or about this procedure, you should contact a lawyer, an office of public legal assistance, or the clerk of the court. The clerk is not permitted to give legal advice, but can refer you to other sources of information.”






(2)
 By requesting, at any time before judgment on the claim for a debt, the court to hold a hearing, the debtor may move to quash the order granting such remedy. The court shall hold a hearing on such motion as soon as practicable, or, if requested by the debtor, within 5 days after receiving the request for a hearing or as soon thereafter as possible. The issues at such hearing shall be limited to—
(A)
 the probable validity of the claim for the debt for which such remedy was granted and of any defense or claim of exemption asserted by such person;




(B)
 compliance with any statutory requirement for the issuance of the prejudgment remedy granted;




(C)
 the existence of any ground set forth in subsection (b); and




(D)
 the inadequacy of alternative remedies (if any) to protect the interests of the United States.






(e)
 
Issuance of Writ
.—
On the court’s determination that the requirements of subsections (a), (b), and (c) have been met, the court shall issue all process sufficient to put into effect the prejudgment remedy sought.


 Attachment
(a)
 
Property Subject to Attachment
.—
(1)
 Any property in the possession, custody, or control of the debtor and in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest, except earnings, may be attached pursuant to a writ of attachment in an action or proceeding against a debtor on a claim for a debt and may be held as security to satisfy such judgment, and interest and costs, as the United States may recover on such claim.




(2)
 The value of property attached shall not exceed the amount by which the sum of the amount of the debt claimed by the United States and the amount of interest and costs reasonably likely to be assessed against the debtor by the court exceeds the aggregate value of the nonexempt interest of the debtor in any—
(A)
 property securing the debt; and




(B)
 property garnished or in receivership, or income sequestered, under this subchapter.






(b)
 
Availability of Attachment
.—
If the requirements of section 3101 are satisfied, a court shall issue a writ authorizing the United States to attach property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest, as security for such judgment (and interest and costs) as the United States may recover on a claim for a debt—
(1)
 in an action on a contract, express or implied, against the debtor for payment of money, only if the United States shows reasonable cause to believe that—
(A)
 the contract is not fully secured by real or personal property; or




(B)
 the value of the original security is substantially diminished, without any act of the United States or the person to whom the security was given, below the amount of the debt;






(2)
 in an action against the debtor for damages in tort;




(3)
 if the debtor resides outside the jurisdiction of the United States; or




(4)
 in an action to recover a fine, penalty, or tax.




(c)
 
Issuance of Writ; Contents
.—
(1)
 Subject to subsections (a) and (b), a writ of attachment shall be issued by the court directing the United States marshal of the district where property described in subsection (a) is located to attach the property.

(3)
 The writ of attachment shall contain—
(A)
 the date of the issuance of the writ;




(B)
 the identity of the court, the docket number of the action, and the identity of the cause of action;




(C)
 the name and last known address of the debtor;




(D)
 the amount to be secured by the attachment; and




(E)
 a reasonable description of the property to be attached.






(d)
 
Levy of Attachment
.—
(1)
 The United States marshal receiving the writ shall proceed without delay to levy upon the property specified for attachment if found within the district. The marshal may not sell property unless ordered by the court.




(2)
 In performing the levy, the United States marshal may enter any property owned, occupied, or controlled by the debtor, except that the marshal may not enter a residence or other building unless the writ expressly authorizes the marshal to do so or upon specific order of the court.




(3)
 Levy on real property is made by entering the property and posting the writ and notice of levy in a conspicuous place upon the property.




(4)
 Levy on personal property is made by taking possession of it. Levy on personal property not easily taken into possession or which cannot be taken into possession without great inconvenience or expense may be made by affixing a copy of the writ and notice of levy on it or in a conspicuous place in the vicinity of it describing in the notice of levy the property by quantity and with sufficient detail to identify the property levied on.




(5)
 The United States marshal shall file a copy of the notice of levy in the same manner as provided for judgments in section 3201(a)(1). The United States marshal shall serve a copy of the writ and notice of levy on—
(A)
 the debtor against whom the writ is issued; and




(B)
 the person who has possession of the property subject to the writ;





in the same manner that a summons is served in a civil action and make the return thereof.

Return of Writ; Duties of Marshal; Further Return
.—
(1)
 A United States marshal executing a writ of attachment shall return the writ with the marshal’s action endorsed thereon or attached thereto and signed by the marshal, to the court from which it was issued, within 5 days after the date of the levy.




(2)
 The return shall describe the property attached with sufficient certainty to identify it and shall state the location where it was attached, the date and time it was attached, and the disposition made of the property. If no property was attached, the return shall so state.




(3)
 If the property levied on is claimed, replevied under subsection (j)(2), or sold under section 3007 after the return, the United States marshal shall immediately make a further return to the clerk of the court showing the disposition of the property.




(4)
 If personal property is replevied, the United States marshal shall deliver the replevin bond to the clerk of the court to be filed in the action.




(f)
 
Levy of Attachment as Lien on Property; Satisfaction of Lien
.—
(1)
 A levy on property under a writ of attachment under this section creates a lien in favor of the United States on the property or, in the case of perishable property sold under section 3007, on the proceeds of the sale.




(2)
 Such lien shall be ranked ahead of any other security interests perfected after the later of the time of levy and the time a copy of the notice of levy is filed under subsection (d)(5).




(3)
 Such lien shall arise from the time of levy and shall continue until a judgment in the action is obtained or denied, or the action is otherwise dismissed. The death of the debtor whose property is attached does not terminate the attachment lien. Upon issuance of a judgment in the action and registration under this chapter, the judgment lien so created relates back to the time of levy.




(g)
 
Reduction or Dissolution of Attachment
.—
(1)
 If an excessive or unreasonable attachment is made, the debtor may submit a motion to the court for a reduction of the amount of the attachment or its dissolution. Notice of such motion shall be served on the United States.




(2)
 The court shall order a part of the property to be released, if after a hearing the court finds that the amount of the attachment is excessive or unreasonable or if the attachment is for an amount larger than the sum of the liquidated or ascertainable amount of the debt and the amount of interest and costs likely to be taxed.




(3)
 The court shall dissolve the attachment if the amount of the debt is unliquidated and unascertainable by calculation.




(4)
 If any property claimed to be exempt is levied on, the debtor may, at any time after such levy, request that the court vacate such levy. If it appears to the court that the property so levied upon is exempt, the court shall order the levy vacated and the property returned to the debtor.




(h)
 
Replevin of Attached Property by Debtor; Bond
.—
If attached property is not sold before judgment, the debtor may replevy such property or any part thereof by giving a bond approved by counsel for the United States or the court and payable to the United States in double the reasonable value of the property to be replevied or double the value of the claim, whichever is less.


(i)
 
Preservation of Personal Property Under Attachment
.—
If personal property in custody of the United States marshal under a writ of attachment is not replevied, claimed, or sold, the court may make such order for its preservation or use as appears to be in the interest of the parties.


(j)
 Judgment and Disposition of Attached Property.—
(1)
 
Judgment for the united states
.—
On entry of judgment for the United States, the court shall order the proceeds of personal property sold pursuant to section 3007 to be applied to the satisfaction of the judgment, and shall order the sale of any remaining personal property and any real property levied on to the extent necessary to satisfy the judgment.




(2)
 
Judgment for the united states when personal property replevied
.—
With respect to personal property under attachment that is replevied, the judgment which may be entered shall be against the debtor against whom the writ of attachment is issued and also against the sureties on the debtor’s replevin bond for the value of the property.




(3)
 
Restoration of property and exoneration of replevin bond
.—
If the attachment is vacated or if the judgment on the claim for the debt is for the person against whom the writ attachment is issued, the court shall order the property, or proceeds of perishable property sold under section 3007, restored to the debtor and shall exonerate any replevin bond.




 Receivership
(a)
 
Appointment of a Receiver
.—
If the requirements of section 3101 are satisfied, a court may appoint a receiver for property in which the debtor has a substantial nonexempt interest if the United States shows reasonable cause to believe that there is a substantial danger that the property will be removed from the jurisdiction of the court, lost, concealed, materially injured or damaged, or mismanaged.


(b)
 
Powers of Receiver
.—
(1)
 The appointing court may authorize a receiver—
(A)
 to take possession of real and personal property and sue for, collect, and sell obligations upon such conditions and for such purposes as the court shall direct; and




(B)
 to administer, collect, improve, lease, repair or sell pursuant to section 3007 such real and personal property as the court shall direct.





A receiver appointed to manage residential or commercial property shall have demonstrable expertise in the management of these types of property.




(2)
 Unless expressly authorized by order of the court, a receiver shall have no power to employ attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons.




(c)
 
Duration of Receivership
.—

(d)
 
Accounts; Requirement to Report
.—
A receiver shall keep written accounts itemizing receipts and expenditures, describing the property and naming the depository of receivership funds.

Modification of Powers; Removal
.—
On motion of the receiver or on its own initiative, the court which appointed the receiver may remove the receiver or modify the receiver’s powers at any time.
