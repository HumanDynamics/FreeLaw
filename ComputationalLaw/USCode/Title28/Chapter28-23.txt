 phase discovery into two or more stages; and

 sets, at the earliest practicable time, deadlines for filing motions and a time framework for their disposition;






(4)
 encouragement of cost-effective discovery through voluntary exchange of information among litigants and their attorneys and through the use of cooperative discovery devices;
