 Trustees, receivers or managers of any property, including debtors in possession, may be sued, without leave of the court appointing them, with respect to any of their acts or transactions in carrying on business connected with such property. Such actions shall be subject to the general equity power of such court so far as the same may be necessary to the ends of justice, but this shall not deprive a litigant of his right to trial by jury.


(b)
 Except as provided in 
section 1166 of title 11
, a trustee, receiver or manager appointed in any cause pending in any court of the United States, including a debtor in possession, shall manage and operate the property in his possession as such trustee, receiver or manager according to the requirements of the valid laws of the State in which such property is situated, in the same manner that the owner or possessor thereof would be bound to do if in possession thereof.


 Tax liability
(a)
 Any officers and agents conducting any business under authority of a United States court shall be subject to all Federal, State and local taxes applicable to such business to the same extent as if it were conducted by an individual or corporation.


(b)
 A tax under subsection (a) shall be paid on or before the due date of the tax under applicable nonbankruptcy law, unless—
(1)
 the tax is a property tax secured by a lien against property that is abandoned under 
section 554 of title 11
, within a reasonable period of time after the lien attaches, by the trustee in a case under title 11; or




(2)
 payment of the tax is excused under a specific provision of title 11.




(c)
 In a case pending under chapter 7 of title 11, payment of a tax may be deferred until final distribution is made under 
section 726 of title 11
, if—
(1)
 the tax was not incurred by a trustee duly appointed or elected under chapter 7 of title 11; or




(2)
 before the due date of the tax, an order of the court makes a finding of probable insufficiency of funds of the estate to pay in full the administrative expenses allowed under 
section 503(b) of title 11
 that have the same priority in distribution under 
section 726(b) of title 11
 as the priority of that tax.

Each clerk of court shall be allowed his necessary office expenses when authorized by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
