 an indictment or information charges that the member committed the offense with one or more other defendants, at least one of whom is not subject to such chapter.




 Arrest and commitment
(a)
 The Secretary of Defense may designate and authorize any person serving in a law enforcement position in the Department of Defense to arrest, in accordance with applicable international agreements, outside the United States any person described in section 3261(a) if there is probable cause to believe that such person violated section 3261(a).

 Except as provided in sections 3263 and 3264, a person arrested under subsection (a) shall be delivered as soon as practicable to the custody of civilian law enforcement authorities of the United States for removal to the United States for judicial proceedings in relation to conduct referred to in such subsection unless such person has had charges brought against him or her under chapter 47 of title 10 for such conduct.


 Delivery to authorities of foreign countries
(a)
 Any person designated and authorized under section 3262(a) may deliver a person described in section 3261(a) to the appropriate authorities of a foreign country in which such person is alleged to have violated section 3261(a) if—

(1)
 to the United States; or




(2)
 to any foreign country other than a country in which such person is believed to have violated section 3261(a).

 a Federal magistrate judge otherwise orders the person to be removed to the United States; or




(5)
 the Secretary of Defense determines that military necessity requires that the limitations in subsection (a) be waived, in which case the person shall be removed to the nearest United States military installation outside the United States adequate to detain the person and to facilitate the initial appearance described in section 3265(a).




 Initial proceedings
(a)
(1)

 shall be conducted by a Federal magistrate judge; and




(B)
 may be carried out by telephony or such other means that enables voice communication among the participants, including any counsel representing the person.

 In conducting the initial appearance, the Federal magistrate judge shall also determine whether there is probable cause to believe that an offense under section 3261(a) was committed and that the person committed it.




(3)
 If the Federal magistrate judge determines that probable cause exists that the person committed an offense under section 3261(a), and if no motion is made seeking the person’s detention before trial, the Federal magistrate judge shall also determine at the initial appearance the conditions of the person’s release before trial under chapter 207 of this title.
