(2)
 In a case described in subsection (f)(1) of this section, a rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community if such judicial officer finds that—

(C)
 a period of not more than five years has elapsed since the date of conviction, or the release of the person from imprisonment, for the offense described in subparagraph (A), whichever is later.






(3)
 Subject to rebuttal by the person, it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person committed—
(A)
 an offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act (
21 U.S.C. 801
 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (
21 U.S.C. 951
 et seq.), or chapter 705 of title 46;




(B)
 an offense under section 924(c), 956(a), or 2332b of this title;




(C)
 an offense listed in 
section 2332b(g)(5)(B) of title 18
, United States Code, for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed;

(f)
 
Detention Hearing
.—
The judicial officer shall hold a hearing to determine whether any condition or combination of conditions set forth in subsection (c) of this section will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other person and the community—
(1)
 upon motion of the attorney for the Government, in a case that involves—
(A)
 a crime of violence, a violation of section 1591, or an offense listed in section 2332b(g)(5)(B) for which a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more is prescribed;




(B)
 an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment or death;




(C)
 an offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed in the Controlled Substances Act (
21 U.S.C. 801
 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (
21 U.S.C. 951
 et seq.), or chapter 705 of title 46;




(D)
 any felony if such person has been convicted of two or more offenses described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph, or two or more State or local offenses that would have been offenses described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph if a circumstance giving rise to Federal jurisdiction had existed, or a combination of such offenses; or




(E)
 any felony that is not otherwise a crime of violence that involves a minor victim or that involves the possession or use of a firearm or destructive device (as those terms are defined in section 921), or any other dangerous weapon, or involves a failure to register under 
section 2250 of title 18
, United States Code; or






(2)
 upon motion of the attorney for the Government or upon the judicial officer’s own motion in a case, that involves—
(A)
 a serious risk that such person will flee; or




(B)
 a serious risk that such person will obstruct or attempt to obstruct justice, or threaten, injure, or intimidate, or attempt to threaten, injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.







The hearing shall be held immediately upon the person’s first appearance before the judicial officer unless that person, or the attorney for the Government, seeks a continuance. Except for good cause, a continuance on motion of such person may not exceed five days (not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday), and a continuance on motion of the attorney for the Government may not exceed three days (not including any intermediate Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday). During a continuance, such person shall be detained, and the judicial officer, on motion of the attorney for the Government or sua sponte, may order that, while in custody, a person who appears to be a narcotics addict receive a medical examination to determine whether such person is an addict. At the hearing, such person has the right to be represented by counsel, and, if financially unable to obtain adequate representation, to have counsel appointed. The person shall be afforded an opportunity to testify, to present witnesses, to cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing, and to present information by proffer or otherwise. The rules concerning admissibility of evidence in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and consideration of information at the hearing. The facts the judicial officer uses to support a finding pursuant to subsection (e) that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community shall be supported by clear and convincing evidence. The person may be detained pending completion of the hearing. The hearing may be reopened, before or after a determination by the judicial officer, at any time before trial if the judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.


(g)
 
Factors To Be Considered
.—
The judicial officer shall, in determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, take into account the available information concerning—
(1)
 the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a violation of section 1591, a Federal crime of terrorism, or involves a minor victim or a controlled substance, firearm, explosive, or destructive device;




(2)
 the weight of the evidence against the person;




(3)
 the history and characteristics of the person, including—

 the person’s character, physical and mental condition, family ties, employment, financial resources, length of residence in the community, community ties, past conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings; and




(B)
 whether, at the time of the current offense or arrest, the person was on probation, on parole, or on other release pending trial, sentencing, appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under Federal, State, or local law; and






(4)
 the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or the community that would be posed by the person’s release. In considering the conditions of release described in subsection (c)(1)(B)(xi) or (c)(1)(B)(xii) of this section, the judicial officer may upon his own motion, or shall upon the motion of the Government, conduct an inquiry into the source of the property to be designated for potential forfeiture or offered as collateral to secure a bond, and shall decline to accept the designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.




(h)
 
Contents of Release Order
.—
In a release order issued under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the judicial officer shall—
(1)
 include a written statement that sets forth all the conditions to which the release is subject, in a manner sufficiently clear and specific to serve as a guide for the person’s conduct; and




(2)
 advise the person of—
(A)
 the penalties for violating a condition of release, including the penalties for committing an offense while on pretrial release;




(B)
 the consequences of violating a condition of release, including the immediate issuance of a warrant for the person’s arrest; and




(C)
 sections 1503 of this title (relating to intimidation of witnesses, jurors, and officers of the court), 1510 (relating to obstruction of criminal investigations), 1512 (tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant), and 1513 (retaliating against a witness, victim, or an informant).






(i)
 
Contents of Detention Order
.—
In a detention order issued under subsection (e) of this section, the judicial officer shall—
(1)
 include written findings of fact and a written statement of the reasons for the detention;




(2)
 direct that the person be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in a corrections facility separate, to the extent practicable, from persons awaiting or serving sentences or being held in custody pending appeal;




(3)
 direct that the person be afforded reasonable opportunity for private consultation with counsel; and




(4)
 direct that, on order of a court of the United States or on request of an attorney for the Government, the person in charge of the corrections facility in which the person is confined deliver the person to a United States marshal for the purpose of an appearance in connection with a court proceeding.





The judicial officer may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person’s defense or for another compelling reason.

(A)
(i)
 the judicial officer finds there is a substantial likelihood that a motion for acquittal or new trial will be granted; or




(ii)
 an attorney for the Government has recommended that no sentence of imprisonment be imposed on the person; and






(B)
 the judicial officer finds by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community.






(b)
 
Release or Detention Pending Appeal by the Defendant
.—
(1)
 Except as provided in paragraph (2), the judicial officer shall order that a person who has been found guilty of an offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and who has filed an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari, be detained, unless the judicial officer finds—
(A)
 by clear and convincing evidence that the person is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released under section 3142(b) or (c) of this title; and




(B)
 that the appeal is not for the purpose of delay and raises a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in—

.—
The judicial officer shall treat a defendant in a case in which an appeal has been taken by the United States under 
section 3731 of this title
, in accordance with 
section 3142 of this title
, unless the defendant is otherwise subject to a release or detention order. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the judicial officer, in a case in which an appeal has been taken by the United States under section 3742, shall—
(1)
 if the person has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, order that person detained; and




(2)
 in any other circumstance, release or detain the person under section 3142.




 Release or detention of a material witness

 and 
section 3731 of this title
. The appeal shall be determined promptly. A person subject to detention pursuant to section 3143(a)(2) or (b)(2), and who meets the conditions of release set forth in section 3143(a)(1) or (b)(1), may be ordered released, under appropriate conditions, by the judicial officer, if it is clearly shown that there are exceptional reasons why such person’s detention would not be appropriate.

Whoever, having been released under this chapter knowingly—
(1)
 fails to appear before a court as required by the conditions of release; or

 fails to surrender for service of sentence pursuant to a court order;





shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of this section.


(b)
 
Punishment
.—
(1)
 The punishment for an offense under this section is—

(c)
 
Affirmative Defense
.—
It is an affirmative defense to a prosecution under this section that uncontrollable circumstances prevented the person from appearing or surrendering, and that the person did not contribute to the creation of such circumstances in reckless disregard of the requirement to appear or surrender, and that the person appeared or surrendered as soon as such circumstances ceased to exist.


(d)
 
Declaration of Forfeiture
.—
If a person fails to appear before a court as required, and the person executed an appearance bond pursuant to 
section 3142(b) of this title
 or is subject to the release condition set forth in clause (xi) or (xii) of 
section 3142(c)(1)(B) of this title
, the judicial officer may, regardless of whether the person has been charged with an offense under this section, declare any property designated pursuant to that section to be forfeited to the United States.


 Penalty for an offense committed while on release
 Sanctions for violation of a release condition
(a)
 
Available Sanctions
.—
A person who has been released under 
section 3142 of this title
, and who has violated a condition of his release, is subject to a revocation of release, an order of detention, and a prosecution for contempt of court.


(b)
 
Revocation of Release
.—
The attorney for the Government may initiate a proceeding for revocation of an order of release by filing a motion with the district court. A judicial officer may issue a warrant for the arrest of a person charged with violating a condition of release, and the person shall be brought before a judicial officer in the district in which such person’s arrest was ordered for a proceeding in accordance with this section. To the extent practicable, a person charged with violating the condition of release that such person not commit a Federal, State, or local crime during the period of release, shall be brought before the judicial officer who ordered the release and whose order is alleged to have been violated. The judicial officer shall enter an order of revocation and detention if, after a hearing, the judicial officer—
(1)
 finds that there is—
(A)
 probable cause to believe that the person has committed a Federal, State, or local crime while on release; or




(B)
 clear and convincing evidence that the person has violated any other condition of release; and






(2)
 finds that—

 based on the factors set forth in 
section 3142(g) of this title
, there is no condition or combination of conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community; or




(B)
 the person is unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions of release.







If there is probable cause to believe that, while on release, the person committed a Federal, State, or local felony, a rebuttable presumption arises that no condition or combination of conditions will assure that the person will not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. If the judicial officer finds that there are conditions of release that will assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community, and that the person will abide by such conditions, the judicial officer shall treat the person in accordance with the provisions of 
section 3142 of this title
 and may amend the conditions of release accordingly.


(c)
 
Prosecution for Contempt
.—
The judicial officer may commence a prosecution for contempt, under 
section 401 of this title
, if the person has violated a condition of release.


 Surrender of an offender by a surety
A person charged with an offense, who is released upon the execution of an appearance bond with a surety, may be arrested by the surety, and if so arrested, shall be delivered promptly to a United States marshal and brought before a judicial officer. The judicial officer shall determine in accordance with the provisions of section 3148(b) whether to revoke the release of the person, and may absolve the surety of responsibility to pay all or part of the bond in accordance with the provisions of Rule 46 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The person so committed shall be held in official detention until released pursuant to this chapter or another provision of law.
 Applicability to a case removed from a State court
