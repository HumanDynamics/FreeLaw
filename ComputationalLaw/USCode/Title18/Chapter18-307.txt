Chapter 307
EMPLOYMENT
 Federal Prison Industries; board of directors
“Federal Prison Industries”, a government corporation of the District of Columbia, shall be administered by a board of six directors, appointed by the President to serve at the will of the President without compensation.
“(a)
 
In General
.—
(1)
 It is the policy of the Federal Government that convicted inmates confined in Federal prisons, jails, and other detention facilities shall work. The type of work in which they will be involved shall be dictated by appropriate security considerations and by the health of the prisoner involved.




“(2)
 A Federal prisoner may be excused from the requirement to work only as necessitated by—
“(A)
 security considerations;




“(B)
 disciplinary action;




“(C)
 medical certification of disability such as would make it impracticable for prison officials to arrange useful work for the prisoner to perform; or




“(D)
 a need for the prisoner to work less than a full work schedule in order to participate in literacy training, drug rehabilitation, or similar programs in addition to the work program.”






“(a)
 On or before 
September 1, 1979
, the Attorney General shall submit to the Congress—
“(1)
 a plan to assure the closure of the United States Penitentiary on McNeil Island, Steilacoom, Washington, on or before 
January 1, 1982
; and




“(2)
 a report on the status of the Federal Prison Industries.




“(b)
 The report made under this section shall include a long-range plan for the improvement of meaningful employment training, and the methods which could be undertaken to employ a greater number of United States prisoners in the program. Such report may include recommendations for legislation.”


 Administration of Federal Prison Industries
(a)
 Federal Prison Industries shall determine in what manner and to what extent industrial operations shall be carried on in Federal penal and correctional institutions for the production of commodities for consumption in such institutions or for sale to the departments or agencies of the United States, but not for sale to the public in competition with private enterprise.


(b)
(1)
 Its board of directors shall provide employment for the greatest number of those inmates in the United States penal and correctional institutions who are eligible to work as is reasonably possible, diversify, so far as practicable, prison industrial operations and so operate the prison shops that no single private industry shall be forced to bear an undue burden of competition from the products of the prison workshops, and to reduce to a minimum competition with private industry or free labor.




(2)
 Federal Prison Industries shall conduct its operations so as to produce products on an economic basis, but shall avoid capturing more than a reasonable share of the market among Federal departments, agencies, and institutions for any specific product. Federal Prison Industries shall concentrate on providing to the Federal Government only those products which permit employment of the greatest number of those inmates who are eligible to work as is reasonably possible.




(3)
 Federal Prison Industries shall diversify its products so that its sales are distributed among its industries as broadly as possible.




(4)
 Any decision by Federal Prison Industries to produce a new product or to significantly expand the production of an existing product shall be made by the board of directors of the corporation. Before the board of directors makes a final decision, the corporation shall do the following:
(A)
 The corporation shall prepare a detailed written analysis of the probable impact on industry and free labor of the plans for new production or expanded production. In such written analysis the corporation shall, at a minimum, identify and consider—
(i)
 the number of vendors currently meeting the requirements of the Federal Government for the product;




(ii)
 the proportion of the Federal Government market for the product currently served by small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or businesses operating in labor surplus areas;




(iii)
 the size of the Federal Government and non-Federal Government markets for the product;




(iv)
 the projected growth in the Federal Government demand for the product; and




(v)
 the projected ability of the Federal Government market to sustain both Federal Prison Industries and private vendors.






(B)
 The corporation shall announce in a publication designed to most effectively provide notice to potentially affected private vendors the plans to produce any new product or to significantly expand production of an existing product. The announcement shall also indicate that the analysis prepared under subparagraph (A) is available through the corporation and shall invite comments from private industry regarding the new production or expanded production.




(C)
 The corporation shall directly advise those affected trade associations that the corporation can reasonably identify the plans for new production or expanded production, and the corporation shall invite such trade associations to submit comments on those plans.




(D)
 The corporation shall provide to the board of directors—
(i)
 the analysis prepared under subparagraph (A) on the proposal to produce a new product or to significantly expand the production of an existing product,




(ii)
 comments submitted to the corporation on the proposal, and




(iii)
 the corporation’s recommendations for action on the proposal in light of such comments.







In addition, the board of directors, before making a final decision under this paragraph on a proposal, shall, upon the request of an established trade association or other interested representatives of private industry, provide a reasonable opportunity to such trade association or other representatives to present comments directly to the board of directors on the proposal.




(5)
 Federal Prison Industries shall publish in the manner specified in paragraph (4)(B) the final decision of the board with respect to the production of a new product or the significant expansion of the production of an existing product.
