Chapter 228A
POST-CONVICTION DNA TESTING
 DNA testing
(a)
 
In General
.—
Upon a written motion by an individual under a sentence of imprisonment or death pursuant to a conviction for a Federal offense (referred to in this section as the “applicant”), the court that entered the judgment of conviction shall order DNA testing of specific evidence if the court finds that all of the following apply:
(1)
 The applicant asserts, under penalty of perjury, that the applicant is actually innocent of—
(A)
 the Federal offense for which the applicant is under a sentence of imprisonment or death; or




(B)
 another Federal or State offense, if—
(i)
 evidence of such offense was admitted during a Federal death sentencing hearing and exoneration of such offense would entitle the applicant to a reduced sentence or new sentencing hearing; and




(ii)
 in the case of a State offense—
(I)
 the applicant demonstrates that there is no adequate remedy under State law to permit DNA testing of the specified evidence relating to the State offense; and




(II)
 to the extent available, the applicant has exhausted all remedies available under State law for requesting DNA testing of specified evidence relating to the State offense.










(2)
 The specific evidence to be tested was secured in relation to the investigation or prosecution of the Federal or State offense referenced in the applicant’s assertion under paragraph (1).




(3)
 The specific evidence to be tested—
(A)
 was not previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant did not—
(i)
 knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to request DNA testing of that evidence in a court proceeding after the date of enactment of the Innocence Protection Act of 2004; or




(ii)
 knowingly fail to request DNA testing of that evidence in a prior motion for postconviction DNA testing; or






(B)
 was previously subjected to DNA testing and the applicant is requesting DNA testing using a new method or technology that is substantially more probative than the prior DNA testing.






(4)
 The specific evidence to be tested is in the possession of the Government and has been subject to a chain of custody and retained under conditions sufficient to ensure that such evidence has not been substituted, contaminated, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any respect material to the proposed DNA testing.




(5)
 The proposed DNA testing is reasonable in scope, uses scientifically sound methods, and is consistent with accepted forensic practices.




(6)
 The applicant identifies a theory of defense that—
(A)
 is not inconsistent with an affirmative defense presented at trial; and




(B)
 would establish the actual innocence of the applicant of the Federal or State offense referenced in the applicant’s assertion under paragraph (1).






(7)
 If the applicant was convicted following a trial, the identity of the perpetrator was at issue in the trial.




(8)
 The proposed DNA testing of the specific evidence may produce new material evidence that would—
(A)
 support the theory of defense referenced in paragraph (6); and




(B)
 raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the offense.






(9)
 The applicant certifies that the applicant will provide a DNA sample for purposes of comparison.




(10)
 The motion is made in a timely fashion, subject to the following conditions:
(A)
 There shall be a rebuttable presumption of timeliness if the motion is made within 60 months of enactment of the Justice For All Act of 2004 or within 36 months of conviction, whichever comes later. Such presumption may be rebutted upon a showing—
(i)
 that the applicant’s motion for a DNA test is based solely upon information used in a previously denied motion; or




(ii)
 of clear and convincing evidence that the applicant’s filing is done solely to cause delay or harass.






(B)
 There shall be a rebuttable presumption against timeliness for any motion not satisfying subparagraph (A) above. Such presumption may be rebutted upon the court’s finding—
(i)
 that the applicant was or is incompetent and such incompetence substantially contributed to the delay in the applicant’s motion for a DNA test;




(ii)
 the evidence to be tested is newly discovered DNA evidence;




(iii)
 that the applicant’s motion is not based solely upon the applicant’s own assertion of innocence and, after considering all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the motion, a denial would result in a manifest injustice; or




(iv)
 upon good cause shown.






(C)
 For purposes of this paragraph—
(i)
 the term “incompetence” has the meaning as defined in 
section 4241 of title 18
, United States Code;




(ii)
 the term “manifest” means that which is unmistakable, clear, plain, or indisputable and requires that the opposite conclusion be clearly evident.

No match
.—
If the DNA test results obtained under this section exclude the applicant as the source of the DNA evidence, and a comparison of the DNA sample of the applicant does not result in a match between the DNA sample of the applicant and another offense, the Attorney General shall destroy the DNA sample of the applicant and ensure that such information is not retained in NDIS if there is no other legal authority to retain the DNA sample of the applicant in NDIS.
