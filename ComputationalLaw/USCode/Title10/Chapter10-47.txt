 If any commissioned officer, dismissed by order of the President, makes a written application for trial by court-martial, setting forth, under oath, that he has been wrongfully dismissed, the President, as soon as practicable, shall convene a general court-martial to try that officer on the charges on which he was dismissed. A court-martial so convened has jurisdiction to try the dismissed officer on those charges, and he shall be considered to have waived the right to plead any statute of limitations applicable to any offense with which he is charged.

(c)
 A commissioned officer, a warrant officer, or a civilian subject to this chapter or to trial thereunder may be ordered into arrest or confinement only by a commanding officer to whose authority he is subject, by an order, oral or written, delivered in person or by another commissioned officer. The authority to order such persons into arrest or confinement may not be delegated.

 Art. 11. Reports and receiving of prisoners
(a)
 No provost marshal, commander of a guard, or master at arms may refuse to receive or keep any prisoner committed to his charge by a commissioned officer of the armed forces, when the committing officer furnishes a statement, signed by him, of the offense charged against the prisoner.

However, except in the case of a member attached to or embarked in a vessel, punishment may not be imposed upon any member of the armed forces under this article if the member has, before the imposition of such punishment, demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of such punishment. Under similar regulations, rules may be prescribed with respect to the suspension of punishments authorized hereunder. If authorized by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commanding officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general or flag rank in command may delegate his powers under this article to a principal assistant.


(b)
 Subject to subsection (a), any commanding officer may, in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, impose one or more of the following disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial—
(1)
 upon officers of his command—
(A)
 restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 30 consecutive days;




(B)
 if imposed by an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general or flag rank in command—
(i)
 arrest in quarters for not more than 30 consecutive days;




(ii)
 forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month’s pay per month for two months;




(iii)
 restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days;

 detention of not more than one-half of one month’s pay per month for three months;

(A)
 if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel, confinement on bread and water or diminished rations for not more than three consecutive days;




(B)
 correctional custody for not more than seven consecutive days;




(C)
 forfeiture of not more than seven days’ pay;




(D)
 reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction;




(E)
 extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than 14 consecutive days;




(F)
 restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 14 consecutive days;




(G)
 detention of not more than 14 days’ pay;




(H)
 if imposed by an officer of the grade of major or lieutenant commander, or above—
(i)
 the punishment authorized under clause (A);




(ii)
 correctional custody for not more than 30 consecutive days;




(iii)
 forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month’s pay per month for two months;




(iv)
 reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E–4 may not be reduced more than two pay grades;




(v)
 extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than 45 consecutive days;




(vi)
 restrictions to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than 60 consecutive days;




(vii)
 detention of not more than one-half of one month’s pay per month for three months.









Detention of pay shall be for a stated period of not more than one year but if the offender’s term of service expires earlier, the detention shall terminate upon that expiration. No two or more of the punishments of arrest in quarters, confinement on bread and water or diminished rations, correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction may be combined to run consecutively in the maximum amount imposable for each. Whenever any of those punishments are combined to run consecutively, there must be an apportionment. In addition, forfeiture of pay may not be combined with detention of pay without an apportionment. For the purposes of this subsection, “correctional custody” is the physical restraint of a person during duty or nonduty hours and may include extra duties, fatigue duties, or hard labor. If practicable, correctional custody will not be served in immediate association with persons awaiting trial or held in confinement pursuant to trial by court-martial.


(c)
 An officer in charge may impose upon enlisted members assigned to the unit of which he is in charge such of the punishments authorized under subsection (b)(2)(A)–(G) as the Secretary concerned may specifically prescribe by regulation.


(d)
 The officer who imposes the punishment authorized in subsection (b), or his successor in command, may, at any time, suspend probationally any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend probationally a reduction in grade or a forfeiture imposed under subsection (b), whether or not executed. In addition, he may, at any time, remit or mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges, and property affected. He may also mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay. When mitigating—
(1)
 arrest in quarters to restriction;




(2)
 confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to correctional custody;




(3)
 correctional custody or confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to extra duties or restriction, or both; or




(4)
 extra duties to restriction;





the mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. When mitigating forfeiture of pay to detention of pay, the amount of the detention shall not be greater than the amount of the forfeiture. When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay, the amount of the forfeiture or detention shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.


(e)
 A person punished under this article who considers his punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through the proper channel, appeal to the next superior authority. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be required to undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under subsection (d) by the officer who imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a punishment of—
(1)
 arrest in quarters for more than seven days;




(2)
 correctional custody for more than seven days;




(3)
 forfeiture of more than seven days’ pay;




(4)
 reduction of one or more pay grades from the fourth or a higher pay grade;




(5)
 extra duties for more than 14 days;




(6)
 restriction for more than 14 days; or




(7)
 detention of more than 14 days’ pay;





the authority who is to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge advocate or a lawyer of the Department of Homeland Security for consideration and advice, and may so refer the case upon appeal from any punishment imposed under subsection (b).


(f)
 The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this article for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission, and not properly punishable under this article; but the fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused upon trial, and when so shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.


(g)
 The Secretary concerned may, by regulation, prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this article and may also prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.


 Art. 16. Courts-martial classified

(b)
 A general court-martial of the kind specified in 
section 816(1)(B) of this title
 (article 16(1)(B)) shall not have jurisdiction to try any person for any offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged unless the case has been previously referred to trial as a noncapital case.


(c)
 Consistent with sections 819, 820, and 856(b) of this title (articles 19, 20, and 56(b)), only general courts-martial have jurisdiction over an offense specified in 
section 856(b)(2) of this title

Subject to 
 Art. 20. Jurisdiction of summary courts-martial

(a)
 Charges and specifications shall be signed by a person subject to this chapter under oath before a commissioned officer of the armed forces authorized to administer oaths and shall state—

 that they are true in fact to the best of his knowledge and belief.

(c)
 No person subject to this chapter may compel any person to make a statement or produce evidence before any military tribunal if the statement or evidence is not material to the issue and may tend to degrade him.

 Art. 32. Investigation

(b)
 The accused shall be advised of the charges against him and of his right to be represented at that investigation by counsel. The accused has the right to be represented at that investigation as provided in 
section 838 of this title
 (article 38) and in regulations prescribed under that section. At that investigation full opportunity shall be given to the accused to cross-examine witnesses against him if they are available and to present anything he may desire in his own behalf, either in defense or mitigation, and the investigating officer shall examine available witnesses requested by the accused. If the charges are forwarded after the investigation, they shall be accompanied by a statement of the substance of the testimony taken on both sides and a copy thereof shall be given to the accused.


(c)
 If an investigation of the subject matter of an offense has been conducted before the accused is charged with the offense, and if the accused was present at the investigation and afforded the opportunities for representation, cross-examination, and presentation prescribed in subsection (b), no further investigation of that charge is necessary under this article unless it is demanded by the accused after he is informed of the charge. A demand for further investigation entitles the accused to recall witnesses for further cross-examination and to offer any new evidence in his own behalf.


(d)
 If evidence adduced in an investigation under this article indicates that the accused committed an uncharged offense, the investigating officer may investigate the subject matter of that offense without the accused having first been charged with the offense if the accused—
(1)
 is present at the investigation;




(2)
 is informed of the nature of each uncharged offense investigated; and




(3)
 is afforded the opportunities for representation, cross-examination, and presentation prescribed in subsection (b).

(1)
 the specification alleges an offense under this chapter;




(2)
 the specification is warranted by the evidence indicated in the report of investigation under 
section 832 of this title
 (article 32) (if there is such a report); and

 a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offense.

 recommending action that the convening authority take regarding the specification.





If the specification is referred for trial, the recommendation of the staff judge advocate shall accompany the specification.

(c)
 A proceeding which, after the introduction of evidence but before a finding, is dismissed or terminated by the convening authority or on motion of the prosecution for failure of available evidence or witnesses without any fault of the accused is a trial in the sense of this article.


 Art. 45. Pleas of the accused
(a)
 If an accused after arraignment makes an irregular pleading, or after a plea of guilty sets up matter inconsistent with the plea, or if it appears that he has entered the plea of guilty improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect, or if he fails or refuses to plead, a plea of not guilty shall be entered in the record, and the court shall proceed as though he had pleaded not guilty.


(b)
 A plea of guilty by the accused may not be received to any charge or specification alleging an offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged. With respect to any other charge or specification to which a plea of guilty has been made by the accused and accepted by the military judge or by a court-martial without a military judge, a finding of guilty of the charge or specification may, if permitted by regulations of the Secretary concerned, be entered immediately without vote. This finding shall constitute the finding of the court unless the plea of guilty is withdrawn prior to announcement of the sentence, in which event the proceedings shall continue as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.


 Art. 46. Opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence
(a)
 
Opportunity To Obtain Witnesses and Other Evidence

(A)
 a violation of section 920, 920a, 920b, 920c, or 925 of this title (article 120, 120a, 120b, 120c, or 125); or

Process issued in court-martial cases to compel witnesses to appear and testify and to compel the production of other evidence shall be similar to that which courts of the United States having criminal jurisdiction may lawfully issue and shall run to any part of the United States, or the Commonwealths and possessions.


 Art. 47. Refusal to appear or testify
(a)
 Any person not subject to this chapter who—
(1)

Upon conviction, such a person shall be fined or imprisoned, or both, at the court’s discretion.


(c)
 The United States attorney or the officer prosecuting for the United States in any such court of original criminal jurisdiction shall, upon the certification of the facts to him by the military court, commission, court of inquiry, board, or convening authority, file an information against and prosecute any person violating this article.

 Art. 49. Depositions
(a)
 At any time after charges have been signed as provided in 
section 830 of this title
 (article 30), any party may take oral or written depositions unless the military judge or court-martial without a military judge hearing the case or, if the case is not being heard, an authority competent to convene a court-martial for the trial of those charges forbids it for good cause. If a deposition is to be taken before charges are referred for trial, such an authority may designate commissioned officers to represent the prosecution and the defense and may authorize those officers to take the deposition of any witness.


(b)
 The party at whose instance a deposition is to be taken shall give to every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for taking the deposition.


(c)
 Depositions may be taken before and authenticated by any military or civil officer authorized by the laws of the United States or by the laws of the place where the deposition is taken to administer oaths.


(d)
 A duly authenticated deposition taken upon reasonable notice to the other parties, so far as otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be read in evidence or, in the case of audiotape, videotape, or similar material, may be played in evidence before any military court or commission in any case not capital, or in any proceeding before a court of inquiry or military board, if it appears—
(1)
 that the witness resides or is beyond the State, Commonwealth, or District of Columbia in which the court, commission, or board is ordered to sit, or beyond 100 miles from the place of trial or hearing;




(2)
 that the witness by reason of death, age, sickness, bodily infirmity, imprisonment, military necessity, nonamenability to process, or other reasonable cause, is unable or refuses to appear and testify in person at the place of trial or hearing; or




(3)
 that the present whereabouts of the witness is unknown.




(e)
 Subject to subsection (d), testimony by deposition may be presented by the defense in capital cases.


(f)
 Subject to subsection (d), a deposition may be read in evidence or, in the case of audiotape, videotape, or similar material, may be played in evidence in any case in which the death penalty is authorized but is not mandatory, whenever the convening authority directs that the case be treated as not capital, and in such a case a sentence of death may not be adjudged by the court-martial.


 Art. 50. Admissibility of records of courts of inquiry
(a)
 In any case not capital and not extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer, the sworn testimony, contained in the duly authenticated record of proceedings of a court of inquiry, of a person whose oral testimony cannot be obtained, may, if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, be read in evidence by any party before a court-martial or military commission if the accused was a party before the court of inquiry and if the same issue was involved or if the accused consents to the introduction of such evidence. This section does not apply to a military commission established under chapter 47A of this title.


(b)
 Such testimony may be read in evidence only by the defense in capital cases or cases extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer.


(c)
 Such testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry or a military board.


 Art. 50a. Defense of lack of mental responsibility
(a)
 It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.


(b)
 The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.


(c)
 Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge, or the president of a court-martial without a military judge, shall instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and charge them to find the accused—
(1)
 guilty;




(2)
 not guilty; or




(3)
 not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.




(d)
 Subsection (c) does not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. In the case of a court-martial composed of a military judge only, whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall find the accused—
(1)
 guilty;




(2)
 not guilty; or




(3)
 not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.




(e)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 852 of this title
 (article 52), the accused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility if—
(1)
 a majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established; or




(2)
 in the case of a court-martial composed of a military judge only, the military judge determines that the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been established.




 Art. 51. Voting and rulings
(a)
 Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence, and by members of a court-martial without a military judge upon questions of challenge, shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.


(b)
 The military judge and, except for questions of challenge, the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall rule upon all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question of law or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused, or by the president of a court-martial without a military judge upon any question of law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge may change his ruling at any time during trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in 
section 852 of this title
 (article 52), beginning with the junior in rank.


(c)
 Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall, in the presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them—
(1)
 that the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;




(2)
 that in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and he must be acquitted;




(3)
 that, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and




(4)
 that the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is upon the United States.




(d)
 Subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition on request find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.


 Art. 52. Number of votes required
(a)
(1)
 No person may be convicted of an offense for which the death penalty is made mandatory by law, except by the concurrence of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken.




(2)
 No person may be convicted of any other offense, except as provided in 
section 845(b) of this title
 (article 45(b)) or by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.




(b)
(1)
 No person may be sentenced to suffer death, except by the concurrence of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken and for an offense in this chapter expressly made punishable by death.




(2)
 No person may be sentenced to life imprisonment or to confinement for more than ten years, except by the concurrence of three-fourths of the members present at the time the vote is taken.




(3)
 All other sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.




(c)
 All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a sentence, with a view toward decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote which indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused’s sanity is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.


 Art. 53. Court to announce action
A court-martial shall announce its findings and sentence to the parties as soon as determined.
 Art. 54. Record of trial
(a)
 Each general court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the military judge. If the record cannot be authenticated by the military judge by reason of his death, disability, or absence, it shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or by that of a member if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it by reason of his death, disability, or absence. In a court-martial consisting of only a military judge the record shall be authenticated by the court reporter under the same conditions which would impose such a duty on a member under this subsection.


(b)
 Each special and summary court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case, and the record shall be authenticated in the manner required by such regulations as the President may prescribe.


(c)
(1)
 A complete record of the proceedings and testimony shall be prepared—
(A)
 in each general court-martial case in which the sentence adjudged includes death, a dismissal, a discharge, or (if the sentence adjudged does not include a discharge) any other punishment which exceeds that which may otherwise be adjudged by a special court-martial; and




(B)
 in each special court-martial case in which the sentence adjudged includes a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for more than six months, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months.






(2)
 In all other court-martial cases, the record shall contain such matters as may be prescribed by regulations of the President.




(d)
 A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.


(e)
 In the case of a general or special court-martial involving a sexual assault or other offense covered by 
section 920 of this title
 (article 120), a copy of all prepared records of the proceedings of the court-martial shall be given to the victim of the offense if the victim testified during the proceedings. The records of the proceedings shall be provided without charge and as soon as the records are authenticated. The victim shall be notified of the opportunity to receive the records of the proceedings.


 Art. 55. Cruel and unusual punishments prohibited
Punishment by flogging, or by branding, marking, or tattooing on the body, or any other cruel or unusual punishment, may not be adjudged by any court-martial or inflicted upon any person subject to this chapter. The use of irons, single or double, except for the purpose of safe custody, is prohibited.
 Art. 56. Maximum and minimum limits
(a)
 The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense.


(b)
(1)
 While a person subject to this chapter who is found guilty of an offense specified in paragraph (2) shall be punished as a general court-martial may direct, such punishment must include, at a minimum, dismissal or dishonorable discharge, except as provided for in 
section 860 of this title
 (article 60).




(2)
 Paragraph (1) applies to the following offenses:
(A)
 An offense in violation of subsection (a) or (b) of 
section 920 of this title
 (article 120(a) or (b)).

 Rape and sexual assault of a child under subsection (a) or (b) of 
section 920b of this title
 (article 120b).




(C)
 Forcible sodomy under 
section 925 of this title
 (article 125).




(D)

section 880 of this title
 (article 80).






 Art. 56a. Sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole
(a)
 For any offense for which a sentence of confinement for life may be adjudged, a court-martial may adjudge a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole.


(b)
 An accused who is sentenced to confinement for life without eligibility for parole shall be confined for the remainder of the accused’s life unless—
(1)
 the sentence is set aside or otherwise modified as a result of—
(A)
 action taken by the convening authority, the Secretary concerned, or another person authorized to act under 
section 860 of this title
 (article 60); or




(B)
 any other action taken during post-trial procedure and review under any other provision of subchapter IX;






(2)
 the sentence is set aside or otherwise modified as a result of action taken by a Court of Criminal Appeals, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or the Supreme Court; or




(3)
 the accused is pardoned.




 Art. 57. Effective date of sentences
(a)
(1)
 Any forfeiture of pay or allowances or reduction in grade that is included in a sentence of a court-martial takes effect on the earlier of—
(A)
 the date that is 14 days after the date on which the sentence is adjudged; or




(B)
 the date on which the sentence is approved by the convening authority.






(2)
 On application by an accused, the convening authority may defer a forfeiture of pay or allowances or reduction in grade that would otherwise become effective under paragraph (1)(A) until the date on which the sentence is approved by the convening authority. Such a deferment may be rescinded at any time by the convening authority.




(3)
 A forfeiture of pay or allowances shall be applicable to pay and allowances accruing on and after the date on which the sentence takes effect.




(4)
 In this subsection, the term “convening authority”, with respect to a sentence of a court-martial, means any person authorized to act on the sentence under 
section 860 of this title
 (article 60).




(b)
 Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement.


(c)
 All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date ordered executed.


 Art. 57a. Deferment of sentences
(a)
 On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned, may in his sole discretion defer service of the sentence to confinement. The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is ordered executed. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned.


(b)
(1)
 In any case in which a court-martial sentences a person referred to in paragraph (2) to confinement, the convening authority may defer the service of the sentence to confinement, without the consent of that person, until after the person has been permanently released to the armed forces by a State or foreign country referred to in that paragraph.




(2)
 Paragraph (1) applies to a person subject to this chapter who—
(A)
 while in the custody of a State or foreign country is temporarily returned by that State or foreign country to the armed forces for trial by court-martial; and

 after the court-martial, is returned to that State or foreign country under the authority of a mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be.






(3)
 In this subsection, the term “State” includes the District of Columbia and any commonwealth, territory, or possession of the United States.




(c)
 In any case in which a court-martial sentences a person to confinement and the sentence to confinement has been ordered executed, but in which review of the case under 
section 867(a)(2) of this title
 (article 67(a)(2)) is pending, the Secretary concerned may defer further service of the sentence to confinement while that review is pending.


 Art. 58. Execution of confinement
(a)
 Under such instructions as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, a sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial or other military tribunal, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into execution by confinement in any place of confinement under the control of any of the armed forces or in any penal or correctional institution under the control of the United States, or which the United States may be allowed to use. Persons so confined in a penal or correctional institution not under the control of one of the armed forces are subject to the same discipline and treatment as persons confined or committed by the courts of the United States or of the State, District of Columbia, or place in which the institution is situated.


(b)
 The omission of the words “hard labor” from any sentence of a court-martial adjudging confinement does not deprive the authority executing that sentence of the power to require hard labor as a part of the punishment.


 Art. 58a. Sentences: reduction in enlisted grade upon approval
(a)
 Unless otherwise provided in regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a court-martial sentence of an enlisted member in a pay grade above E–1, as approved by the convening authority, that includes—

 a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge;




(2)
 confinement; or




(3)
 hard labor without confinement;





reduces that member to pay grade E–1, effective on the date of that approval.

 Art. 58b. Sentences: forfeiture of pay and allowances during confinement
(a)
(1)
 A court-martial sentence described in paragraph (2) shall result in the forfeiture of pay, or of pay and allowances, due that member during any period of confinement or parole. The forfeiture pursuant to this section shall take effect on the date determined under 
section 857(a) of this title
 (article 57(a)) and may be deferred as provided in that section. The pay and allowances forfeited, in the case of a general court-martial, shall be all pay and allowances due that member during such period and, in the case of a special court-martial, shall be two-thirds of all pay due that member during such period.




(2)
 A sentence covered by this section is any sentence that includes—
(A)
 confinement for more than six months or death; or




(B)
 confinement for six months or less and a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge or dismissal.

section 860 of this title
 (article 60) may waive any or all of the forfeitures of pay and allowances required by subsection (a) for a period not to exceed six months. Any amount of pay or allowances that, except for a waiver under this subsection, would be forfeited shall be paid, as the convening authority or other person taking action directs, to the dependents of the accused.


(c)
 If the sentence of a member who forfeits pay and allowances under subsection (a) is set aside or disapproved or, as finally approved, does not provide for a punishment referred to in subsection (a)(2), the member shall be paid the pay and allowances which the member would have been paid, except for the forfeiture, for the period during which the forfeiture was in effect.


 Art. 59. Error of law; lesser included offense
(a)
 A finding or sentence of a court-martial may not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.


(b)
 Any reviewing authority with the power to approve or affirm a finding of guilty may approve or affirm, instead, so much of the finding as includes a lesser included offense.


 Art. 60. Action by the convening authority
(a)
 The findings and sentence of a court-martial shall be reported promptly to the convening authority after the announcement of the sentence.


(b)
(1)
 The accused may submit to the convening authority matters for consideration by the convening authority with respect to the findings and the sentence. Any such submission shall be in writing. Except in a summary court-martial case, such a submission shall be made within 10 days after the accused has been given an authenticated record of trial and, if applicable, the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer under subsection (e). In a summary court-martial case, such a submission shall be made within seven days after the sentence is announced.




(2)
 If the accused shows that additional time is required for the accused to submit such matters, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section, for good cause, may extend the applicable period under paragraph (1) for not more than an additional 20 days.




(3)
 In a summary court-martial case, the accused shall be promptly provided a copy of the record of trial for use in preparing a submission authorized by paragraph (1).

(C)
 If the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section acts to disapprove, commute, or suspend, in whole or in part, the sentence of the court-martial for an offense (other than a qualifying offense), the convening authority or other person shall provide, at that same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action.

(B)
 If the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section acts on the findings of a court-martial, the convening authority or other person—

(C)
 If the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section acts on the findings to dismiss or change any charge or specification for an offense (other than a qualifying offense), the convening authority or other person shall provide, at that same time, a written explanation of the reasons for such action.

(C)
 If a pre-trial agreement has been entered into by the convening authority and the accused, as authorized by Rule for Courts–Martial 705, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall have the authority to approve, disapprove, commute, or suspend a sentence in whole or in part pursuant to the terms of the pre-trial agreement, subject to the following limitations for convictions of offenses that involve a mandatory minimum sentence:
(i)
 If a mandatory minimum sentence of a dishonorable discharge applies to an offense for which the accused has been convicted, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section may commute the dishonorable discharge to a bad conduct discharge pursuant to the terms of the pre-trial agreement.




(ii)
 Except as provided in clause (i), if a mandatory minimum sentence applies to an offense for which the accused has been convicted, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section may not disapprove, otherwise commute, or suspend the mandatory minimum sentence in whole or in part, unless authorized to do so under subparagraph (B).








(d)
(1)
 In any case in which findings and sentence have been adjudged for an offense that involved a victim, the victim shall be provided an opportunity to submit matters for consideration by the convening authority or by another person authorized to act under this section before the convening authority or such other person takes action under this section.




(2)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the submission of matters under paragraph (1) shall be made within 10 days after the later of—
(i)
 the date on which the victim has been given an authenticated record of trial in accordance with 
section 854(e) of this title
 (article 54(e)); and




(ii)
 if applicable, the date on which the victim has been given the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer under subsection (e).






(B)
 In the case of a summary court-martial, the submission of matters under paragraph (1) shall be made within seven days after the date on which the sentence is announced.






(3)
 If a victim shows that additional time is required for submission of matters under paragraph (1), the convening authority or other person taking action under this section, for good cause, may extend the submission period under paragraph (2) for not more than an additional 20 days.




(4)
 A victim may waive the right under this subsection to make a submission to the convening authority or other person taking action under this section. Such a waiver shall be made in writing and may not be revoked. For the purposes of subsection (c)(2), the time within which a victim may make a submission under this subsection shall be deemed to have expired upon the submission of such waiver to the convening authority or such other person.




(5)
 In this section, the term “victim” means a person who has suffered a direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary loss as a result of a commission of an offense under this chapter (the Uniform Code of Military Justice) and on which the convening authority or other person authorized to take action under this section is taking action under this section.




(e)
 Before acting under this section on any general court-martial case or any special court-martial case that includes a bad-conduct discharge, the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section shall obtain and consider the written recommendation of his staff judge advocate or legal officer. The convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall refer the record of trial to his staff judge advocate or legal officer, and the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall use such record in the preparation of his recommendation. The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall include such matters as the President may prescribe by regulation and shall be served on the accused, who may submit any matter in response under subsection (b). Failure to object in the response to the recommendation or to any matter attached to the recommendation waives the right to object thereto.


(f)
(1)
 The convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section may order a proceeding in revision or a rehearing.




(2)
 A proceeding in revision may be ordered if there is an apparent error or omission in the record or if the record shows improper or inconsistent action by a court-martial with respect to the findings or sentence that can be rectified without material prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused. In no case, however, may a proceeding in revision—
(A)
 reconsider a finding of not guilty of any specification or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty;




(B)
 reconsider a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless there has been a finding of guilty under a specification laid under that charge, which sufficiently alleges a violation of some article of this chapter; or




(C)
 increase the severity of the sentence unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory.






(3)
 A rehearing may be ordered by the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section if he disapproves the findings and sentence and states the reasons for disapproval of the findings. If such person disapproves the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, he shall dismiss the charges. A rehearing as to the findings may not be ordered where there is a lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings. A rehearing as to the sentence may be ordered if the convening authority or other person taking action under this subsection disapproves the sentence.




 Art. 61. Waiver or withdrawal of appeal
(a)
 In each case subject to appellate review under section 866 or 869(a) of this title (article 66 or 69(a)), except a case in which the sentence as approved under 
section 860(c) of this title
 (article 60(c)) includes death, the accused may file with the convening authority a statement expressly waiving the right of the accused to such review. Such a waiver shall be signed by both the accused and by defense counsel and must be filed within 10 days after the action under 
section 860(c) of this title
 (article 60(c)) is served on the accused or on defense counsel. The convening authority or other person taking such action, for good cause, may extend the period for such filing by not more than 30 days.


(b)
 Except in a case in which the sentence as approved under 
section 860(c) of this title
 (article 60(c)) includes death, the accused may withdraw an appeal at any time.


(c)
 A waiver of the right to appellate review or the withdrawal of an appeal under this section bars review under section 866 or 869(a) of this title (article 66 or 69(a)).


 Art. 62. Appeal by the United States
(a)
(1)
 In a trial by court-martial in which a military judge presides and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the United States may appeal the following (other than an order or ruling that is, or that amounts to, a finding of not guilty with respect to the charge or specification):
(A)
 An order or ruling of the military judge which terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification.




(B)
 An order or ruling which excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.




(C)
 An order or ruling which directs the disclosure of classified information.

 An order or ruling which imposes sanctions for nondisclosure of classified information.




(E)
 A refusal of the military judge to issue a protective order sought by the United States to prevent the disclosure of classified information.




(F)
 A refusal by the military judge to enforce an order described in subparagraph (E) that has previously been issued by appropriate authority.






(2)
 An appeal of an order or ruling may not be taken unless the trial counsel provides the military judge with written notice of appeal from the order or ruling within 72 hours of the order or ruling. Such notice shall include a certification by the trial counsel that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and (if the order or ruling appealed is one which excludes evidence) that the evidence excluded is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.




(3)
 An appeal under this section shall be diligently prosecuted by appellate Government counsel.




(b)
 An appeal under this section shall be forwarded by a means prescribed under regulations of the President directly to the Court of Criminal Appeals and shall, whenever practicable, have priority over all other proceedings before that court. In ruling on an appeal under this section, the Court of Criminal Appeals may act only with respect to matters of law, notwithstanding 
section 866(c) of this title
 (article 66(c)).


(c)
 Any period of delay resulting from an appeal under this section shall be excluded in deciding any issue regarding denial of a speedy trial unless an appropriate authority determines that the appeal was filed solely for the purpose of delay with the knowledge that it was totally frivolous and without merit.


 Art. 63. Rehearings
Each rehearing under this chapter shall take place before a court-martial composed of members not members of the court-martial which first heard the case. Upon a rehearing the accused may not be tried for any offense of which he was found not guilty by the first court-martial, and no sentence in excess of or more severe than the original sentence may be approved, unless the sentence is based upon a finding of guilty of an offense not considered upon the merits in the original proceedings, or unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. If the sentence approved after the first court-martial was in accordance with a pretrial agreement and the accused at the rehearing changes his plea with respect to the charges or specifications upon which the pretrial agreement was based, or otherwise does not comply with the pretrial agreement, the approved sentence as to those charges or specifications may include any punishment not in excess of that lawfully adjudged at the first court-martial.
 Art. 64. Review by a judge advocate
(a)
 Each case in which there has been a finding of guilty that is not reviewed under section 866 or 869(a) of this title (article 66 or 69(a)) shall be reviewed by a judge advocate under regulations of the Secretary concerned. A judge advocate may not review a case under this subsection if he has acted in the same case as an accuser, investigating officer, member of the court, military judge, or counsel or has otherwise acted on behalf of the prosecution or defense.

 the sentence was within the limits prescribed as a matter of law.






(2)
 A response to each allegation of error made in writing by the accused.




(3)
 If the case is sent for action under subsection (b), a recommendation as to the appropriate action to be taken and an opinion as to whether corrective action is required as a matter of law.




(b)
 The record of trial and related documents in each case reviewed under subsection (a) shall be sent for action to the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the accused at the time the court was convened (or to that person’s successor in command) if—
(1)
 the judge advocate who reviewed the case recommends corrective action;




(2)
 the sentence approved under 
section 860(c) of this title
 (article 60(c)) extends to dismissal, a bad-conduct or dishonorable discharge, or confinement for more than six months; or




(3)
 such action is otherwise required by regulations of the Secretary concerned.




(c)
(1)
 The person to whom the record of trial and related documents are sent under subsection (b) may—
(A)
 disapprove or approve the findings or sentence, in whole or in part;

(2)
 If a rehearing is ordered but the convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, he shall dismiss the charges.




(3)
 If the opinion of the judge advocate in the judge advocate’s review under subsection (a) is that corrective action is required as a matter of law and if the person required to take action under subsection (b) does not take action that is at least as favorable to the accused as that recommended by the judge advocate, the record of trial and action thereon shall be sent to the Judge Advocate General for review under 
section 869(b) of this title
 (article 69(b)).




 Art. 65. Disposition of records
(a)
 In a case subject to appellate review under section 866 or 869(a) of this title (article 66 or 69(a)) in which the right to such review is not waived, or an appeal is not withdrawn, under 
section 861 of this title
 (article 61), the record of trial and action thereon shall be transmitted to the Judge Advocate General for appropriate action.


(b)
 Except as otherwise required by this chapter, all other records of trial and related documents shall be transmitted and disposed of as the Secretary concerned may prescribe by regulation.


 Art. 66. Review by Court of Criminal Appeals
(a)
 Each Judge Advocate General shall establish a Court of Criminal Appeals which shall be composed of one or more panels, and each such panel shall be composed of not less than three appellate military judges. For the purpose of reviewing court-martial cases, the court may sit in panels or as a whole in accordance with rules prescribed under subsection (f). Any decision of a panel may be reconsidered by the court sitting as a whole in accordance with such rules. Appellate military judges who are assigned to a Court of Criminal Appeals may be commissioned officers or civilians, each of whom must be a member of a bar of a Federal court or of the highest court of a State. The Judge Advocate General shall designate as chief judge one of the appellate military judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals established by him. The chief judge shall determine on which panels of the court the appellate judges assigned to the court will serve and which military judge assigned to the court will act as the senior judge on each panel.


(b)
 The Judge Advocate General shall refer to a Court of Criminal Appeals the record in each case of trial by court-martial—
(1)
 in which the sentence, as approved, extends to death, dismissal of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or confinement for one year or more; and




(2)
 except in the case of a sentence extending to death, the right to appellate review has not been waived or an appeal has not been withdrawn under 
section 861 of this title
 (article 61).




(c)
 In a case referred to it, the Court of Criminal Appeals may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority. It may affirm only such findings of guilty, and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds correct in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved. In considering the record, it may weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses.


(d)
 If the Court of Criminal Appeals sets aside the findings and sentence, it may, except where the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If it sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, it shall order that the charges be dismissed.


(e)
 The Judge Advocate General shall, unless there is to be further action by the President, the Secretary concerned, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or the Supreme Court, instruct the convening authority to take action in accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals. If the Court of Criminal Appeals has ordered a rehearing but the convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, he may dismiss the charges.


(f)
 The Judge Advocates General shall prescribe uniform rules of procedure for Courts of Criminal Appeals and shall meet periodically to formulate policies and procedure in regard to review of court-martial cases in the offices of the Judge Advocates General and by Courts of Criminal Appeals.


(g)
 No member of a Court of Criminal Appeals shall be required, or on his own initiative be permitted, to prepare, approve, disapprove, review, or submit, with respect to any other member of the same or another Court of Criminal Appeals, an effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency report, or any other report or document used in whole or in part for the purpose of determining whether a member of the armed forces is qualified to be advanced in grade, or in determining the assignment or transfer of a member of the armed forces, or in determining whether a member of the armed forces should be retained on active duty.


(h)
 No member of a Court of Criminal Appeals shall be eligible to review the record of any trial if such member served as investigating officer in the case or served as a member of the court-martial before which such trial was conducted, or served as military judge, trial or defense counsel, or reviewing officer of such trial.


 Art. 67. Review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
(a)
 The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces shall review the record in—
(1)
 all cases in which the sentence, as affirmed by a Court of Criminal Appeals, extends to death;




(2)
 all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals which the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review; and




(3)
 all cases reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals in which, upon petition of the accused and on good cause shown, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has granted a review.




(b)
 The accused may petition the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for review of a decision of a Court of Criminal Appeals within 60 days from the earlier of—
(1)
 the date on which the accused is notified of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals; or




(2)
 the date on which a copy of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals, after being served on appellate counsel of record for the accused (if any), is deposited in the United States mails for delivery by first-class certified mail to the accused at an address provided by the accused or, if no such address has been provided by the accused, at the latest address listed for the accused in his official service record.





The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces shall act upon such a petition promptly in accordance with the rules of the court.


(c)
 In any case reviewed by it, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set aside as incorrect in law by the Court of Criminal Appeals. In a case which the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, that action need be taken only with respect to the issues raised by him. In a case reviewed upon petition of the accused, that action need be taken only with respect to issues specified in the grant of review. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces shall take action only with respect to matters of law.


(d)
 If the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces sets aside the findings and sentence, it may, except where the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If it sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, it shall order that the charges be dismissed.


(e)
 After it has acted on a case, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces may direct the Judge Advocate General to return the record to the Court of Criminal Appeals for further review in accordance with the decision of the court. Otherwise, unless there is to be further action by the President or the Secretary concerned, the Judge Advocate General shall instruct the convening authority to take action in accordance with that decision. If the court has ordered a rehearing, but the convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, he may dismiss the charges.


 Art. 67a. Review by the Supreme Court

section 1915(a) of title 28
.


 Art. 68. Branch offices
The Secretary concerned may direct the Judge Advocate General to establish a branch office with any command. The branch office shall be under an Assistant Judge Advocate General who, with the consent of the Judge Advocate General, may establish a Court of Criminal Appeals with one or more panels. That Assistant Judge Advocate General and any Court of Criminal Appeals established by him may perform for that command under the general supervision of the Judge Advocate General, the respective duties which the Judge Advocate General and a Court of Criminal Appeals established by the Judge Advocate General would otherwise be required to perform as to all cases involving sentences not requiring approval by the President.
 Art. 69. Review in the office of the Judge Advocate General
(a)
 The record of trial in each general court-martial that is not otherwise reviewed under 
section 866 of this title
 (article 66) shall be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General if there is a finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or withdraw his right to appellate review under 
section 861 of this title
 (article 61). If any part of the findings or sentence is found to be unsupported in law or if reassessment of the sentence is appropriate, the Judge Advocate General may modify or set aside the findings or sentence or both.


(b)
 The findings or sentence, or both, in a court-martial case not reviewed under subsection (a) or under 
section 866 of this title
 (article 66) may be modified or set aside, in whole or in part, by the Judge Advocate General on the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court, lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the sentence. If such a case is considered upon application of the accused, the application must be filed in the office of the Judge Advocate General by the accused on or before the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date the sentence is approved under 
section 860(c) of this title
 (article 60(c)), unless the accused establishes good cause for failure to file within that time.


(c)
 If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings or sentence, he may, except when the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If he sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, he shall order that the charges be dismissed. If the Judge Advocate General orders a rehearing but the convening authority finds a rehearing impractical, the convening authority shall dismiss the charges.


(d)
 A Court of Criminal Appeals may review, under 
section 866 of this title
 (article 66)—
(1)
 any court-martial case which (A) is subject to action by the Judge Advocate General under this section, and (B) is sent to the Court of Criminal Appeals by order of the Judge Advocate General; and




(2)
 any action taken by the Judge Advocate General under this section in such case.




(e)

section 866 of this title
 (article 66), in any case reviewed by a Court of Criminal Appeals under this section, the Court may take action only with respect to matters of law.

(b)
 If in the case of a commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman, the sentence of a court-martial extends to dismissal, that part of the sentence providing for dismissal may not be executed until approved by the Secretary concerned or such Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary as may be designated by the Secretary concerned. In such a case, the Secretary, Under Secretary, or Assistant Secretary, as the case may be, may commute, remit, or suspend the sentence, or any part of the sentence, as he sees fit. In time of war or national emergency he may commute a sentence of dismissal to reduction to any enlisted grade. A person so reduced may be required to serve for the duration of the war or emergency and six months thereafter.

A judgment as to legality of the proceedings is final in such cases when review is completed by a Court of Criminal Appeals and—
(A)
 the time for the accused to file a petition for review by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has expired and the accused has not filed a timely petition for such review and the case is not otherwise under review by that Court;




(B)
 such a petition is rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces; or

(ii)
 such a petition is rejected by the Supreme Court; or




(iii)
 review is otherwise completed in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court.








(2)
 If a sentence extends to dismissal or a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge and if the right of the accused to appellate review is waived, or an appeal is withdrawn, under 
section 861 of this title
 (article 61), that part of the sentence extending to dismissal or a bad-conduct or dishonorable discharge may not be executed until review of the case by a judge advocate (and any action on that review) under 
section 864 of this title
 (article 64) is completed. Any other part of a court-martial sentence may be ordered executed by the convening authority or other person acting on the case under 
section 860 of this title
 (article 60) when approved by him under that section.




(d)
 The convening authority or other person acting on the case under 
section 860 of this title
 (article 60) may suspend the execution of any sentence or part thereof, except a death sentence. Paragraphs (2) and (4) of subsection (c) of 
section 860 of this title
 (article 60) shall apply to any decision by the convening authority or another person authorized to act under this section to suspend the execution of any sentence or part thereof under this subsection.

The probationer shall be represented at the hearing by counsel if he so desires.


(b)
 The record of the hearing and the recommendation of the officer having special court-martial jurisdiction shall be sent for action to the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer. If he vacates the suspension, any unexecuted part of the sentence, except a dismissal, shall be executed, subject to applicable restrictions in section 871 (c) of this title (article 71(c)). The vacation of the suspension of a dismissal is not effective until approved by the Secretary concerned.


(c)
 The suspension of any other sentence may be vacated by any authority competent to convene, for the command in which the accused is serving or assigned, a court of the kind that imposed the sentence.


 Art. 73. Petition for a new trial
At any time within two years after approval by the convening authority of a court-martial sentence, the accused may petition the Judge Advocate General for a new trial on the grounds of newly discovered evidence or fraud on the court. If the accused’s case is pending before a Court of Criminal Appeals or before the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the Judge Advocate General shall refer the petition to the appropriate court for action. Otherwise the Judge Advocate General shall act upon the petition.
 Art. 74. Remission and suspension
(a)
 The Secretary concerned and, when designated by him, any Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Judge Advocate General, or commanding officer may remit or suspend any part or amount of the unexecuted part of any sentence, including all uncollected forfeitures other than a sentence approved by the President. However, in the case of a sentence of confinement for life without eligibility for parole that is adjudged for an offense committed after 
October 29, 2000
, after the sentence is ordered executed, the authority of the Secretary concerned under the preceding sentence (1) may not be delegated, and (2) may be exercised only after the service of a period of confinement of not less than 20 years.


(b)
 The Secretary concerned may, for good cause, substitute an administrative form of discharge for a discharge or dismissal executed in accordance with the sentence of a court-martial.


 Art. 75. Restoration
(a)
 Under such regulations as the President may prescribe, all rights, privileges, and property affected by an executed part of a court-martial sentence which has been set aside or disapproved, except an executed dismissal or discharge, shall be restored unless a new trial or rehearing is ordered and such executed part is included in a sentence imposed upon the new trial or rehearing.


(b)
 If a previously executed sentence of dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge is not imposed on a new trial, the Secretary concerned shall substitute therefor a form of discharge authorized for administrative issuance unless the accused is to serve out the remainder of his enlistment.


(c)
 If a previously executed sentence of dismissal is not imposed on a new trial, the Secretary concerned shall substitute therefor a form of discharge authorized for administrative issue, and the commissioned officer dismissed by that sentence may be reappointed by the President alone to such commissioned grade and with such rank as in the opinion of the President that former officer would have attained had he not been dismissed. The reappointment of such a former officer shall be without regard to the existence of a vacancy and shall affect the promotion status of other officers only insofar as the President may direct. All time between the dismissal and the reappointment shall be considered as actual service for all purposes, including the right to pay and allowances.


 Art. 76. Finality of proceedings, findings, and sentences
The appellate review of records of trial provided by this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed as required by this chapter, and all dismissals and discharges carried into execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or affirmation as required by this chapter, are final and conclusive. Orders publishing the proceedings of courts-martial and all action taken pursuant to those proceedings are binding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of the United States, subject only to action upon a petition for a new trial as provided in 
 Art. 76a. Leave required to be taken pending review of certain court-martial convictions
Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an accused who has been sentenced by a court-martial may be required to take leave pending completion of action under this subchapter if the sentence, as approved under

(1)
 A person who has completed a term of service for which he was appointed as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is eligible for an annuity under this section upon separation from civilian service in the Federal Government. A person who continues service with the court as a senior judge under 
section 942(e)(1)(B) of this title
 (article 142(e)(1)(B)) upon the expiration of the judge’s term shall be considered to have been separated from civilian service in the Federal Government only upon the termination of that continuous service.




(2)
 A person who is eligible for an annuity under this section shall be paid that annuity if, at the time he becomes eligible to receive that annuity, he elects to receive that annuity in lieu of any other annuity for which he may be eligible at the time of such election (whether an immediate or a deferred annuity) under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5 or any other retirement system for civilian employees of the Federal Government. Such an election may not be revoked.




(3)
(A)
 The Secretary of Defense shall notify the Director of the Office of Personnel Management whenever an election under paragraph (2) is made affecting any right or interest under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5 based on service as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.




(B)
 Upon receiving any notification under subparagraph (A) in the case of a person making an election under paragraph (2), the Director shall determine the amount of the person’s lump-sum credit under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5, as applicable, and shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer such amount from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund to the Department of Defense Military Retirement Fund.

 In determining the amount of a lump-sum credit under 
section 8331(8) of title 5
 for purposes of this paragraph—
(i)
 interest shall be computed using the rates under section 8334(e)(3) of such title; and

Amount of Annuity
.—
The annuity payable under this section to a person who makes an election under subsection (a)(2) is 80 percent of the rate of pay for a judge in active service on the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces as of the date on which the person is separated from civilian service.

The program may include provisions for the reduction in the annuity paid the person as a condition for the survivor annuity. An election by a judge (including a senior judge) or former judge to receive an annuity under this section terminates any right or interest which any other individual may have to a survivor annuity under any other retirement system for civilian employees of the Federal Government based on the service of that judge or former judge as a civilian officer or employee of the Federal Government (except with respect to an election under subsection (g)(1)(B)).


(e)

(1)
 A person who is receiving an annuity under this section by reason of service as a judge of the court and who later is appointed as a justice or judge of the United States to hold office during good behavior and who retires from that office, or from regular active service in that office, shall be paid either (A) the annuity under this section, or (B) the annuity or salary to which he is entitled by reason of his service as such a justice or judge of the United States, as determined by an election by that person at the time of his retirement from the office, or from regular active service in the office, of justice or judge of the United States. Such an election may not be revoked.




(2)

(B)
 would be eligible to make an election under section 301(a)(2) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986, by virtue of being appointed as such a judge, but for the fact that such person has not had a break in service of sufficient duration to be considered someone who is being reemployed by the Federal Government.
