CATALOGING AND STANDARDIZATION
 Defense supply management
(a)
 The Secretary of Defense shall develop a single catalog system and related program of standardizing supplies for the Department of Defense.


(b)
 In cataloging, the Secretary shall name, describe, classify, and number each item recurrently used, bought, stocked, or distributed by the Department of Defense, so that only one distinctive combination of letters or numerals, or both, identifies the same item throughout the Department of Defense. Only one identification may be used for each item for all supply functions from purchase to final disposal in the field or other area. The catalog may consist of a number of volumes, sections, or supplements. It shall include all items of supply and, for each item, information needed for supply operations, such as descriptive and performance data, size, weight, cubage, packaging and packing data, a standard quantitative unit of measurement, and other related data that the Secretary determines to be desirable.


(c)
 In standardizing supplies the Secretary shall, to the highest degree practicable—
(1)
 standardize items used throughout the Department of Defense by developing and using single specifications, eliminating overlapping and duplicate specifications, and reducing the number of sizes and kinds of items that are generally similar;




(2)
 standardize the methods of packing, packaging, and preserving such items; and




(3)
 make efficient use of the services and facilities for inspecting, testing, and accepting such items.




(d)
 The Secretary shall coordinate with the Administrator of General Services to enable the use of commercial identifiers for commercial items within the Federal cataloging system.

 Duties of Secretary of Defense
“(a)
 Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [
Sept. 24, 1983
], the Secretary of Defense shall issue regulations which—
“(1)
 except as provided in clause (2), prohibit the purchase of any spare part or replacement equipment when the price of such part or equipment, since a time in the past specified by the Secretary (in terms of days or months) or since the most recent purchase of such part or equipment by the Department of Defense, has increased in price by a percentage in excess of a percentage threshold specified by the Secretary in such regulations, and




“(2)
 permit the purchase of such spare part or equipment (notwithstanding the prohibition contained in clause (1)) if the contracting officer for such part or equipment certifies in writing to the head of the procuring activity before the purchase is made that—
“(A)
 such officer has evaluated the price of such part or equipment and concluded that the increase in the price of such part or equipment is fair and reasonable, or




“(B)
 the national security interests of the United States require that such part or equipment be purchased despite the increase in price of such part or equipment.






“(b)
(1)
 The Secretary shall publish the regulations issued under this section in the Federal Register.




“(2)
 The Secretary may provide in such regulations for the waiver of the prohibition in subsection (a)(1) and compliance with the requirements of subsection (a)(2) in the case of a purchase of any spare part or replacement equipment made or to be made through competitive procedures.

section 2451 of this title
 is distributed, and with respect to the kinds of items covered by that part, only the items listed in it may be procured for recurrent use in the Department of Defense. However, a military department may acquire any new item that is necessary to carry out its mission. As soon as such an item is acquired, it shall be submitted to the Secretary for inclusion in the catalog and the standardization program.


(b)
 Obsolete items may be deleted from the catalog at any time.

 Coordination with General Services Administration
To avoid unnecessary duplication, the Administrator of General Services and the Secretary of Defense shall coordinate the cataloging and standardization activities of the General Services Administration and the Department of Defense.
 Standardization of equipment with North Atlantic Treaty Organization members
(a)
 It is the policy of the United States to standardize equipment, including weapons systems, ammunition, and fuel, procured for the use of the armed forces of the United States stationed in Europe under the North Atlantic Treaty or at least to make that equipment interoperable with equipment of other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To carry out this policy, the Secretary of Defense shall—
(1)
 assess the costs and possible loss of nonnuclear combat effectiveness of the military forces of the members of the Organization caused by the failure of the members to standardize equipment;




(2)
 maintain a list of actions to be taken, including an evaluation of the priority and effect of the action, to standardize equipment that may improve the overall nonnuclear defense capability of the Organization or save resources for the Organization; and




(3)
 initiate and carry out, to the maximum extent feasible, procurement procedures to acquire standardized or interoperable equipment, considering the cost, function, quality, and availability of the equipment.




(b)
 Progress in realizing the objectives of standardization and interoperability would be enhanced by expanded inter-Allied procurement of arms and equipment within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Expanded inter-Allied procurement would be made easier by greater reliance on licensing and coproduction cooperative agreements among the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty. If constructed to preserve the efficiencies associated with economies of scale, the agreements could minimize potential economic hardship to parties to the agreements and increase the survivability, in time of war, of the North Atlantic Alliance’s armaments production base by dispersing manufacturing facilities. In conjunction with other members of the Organization and to the maximum extent feasible, the Secretary shall—
(1)
 identify areas in which those cooperative agreements may be made with members of the Alliance; and




(2)
 negotiate those agreements.




(c)
(1)
 It is the sense of Congress that weapons systems being developed wholly or primarily for employment in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization theater should conform to a common Organization requirement in order to proceed toward joint doctrine and planning and to facilitate maximum feasible standardization and interoperability of equipment, and that a common Organization requirement should be understood to include a common definition of the military threat to the members of the Organization.




(2)
 It is further the sense of Congress that standardization of weapons and equipment within the Organization on the basis of a “two-way street” concept of cooperation in defense procurement between Europe and North America can only work in a realistic sense if the European nations operate on a united and collective basis. Therefore, the governments of Europe are encouraged to accelerate their present efforts to achieve European armaments collaboration among all European members of the Organization.

(e)
 If the Secretary decides that procurement of equipment manufactured outside the United States is necessary to carry out the policy of subsection (a), the Secretary may determine under 
section 8302 of title 41
 that acquiring that equipment manufactured in the United States is inconsistent with the public interest.


(f)
 The Secretary shall submit the results of each assessment and evaluation made under subsection (a)(1) and (2) to the appropriate North Atlantic Treaty Organization body to become an integral part of the overall Organization review of force goals and development of force plans.
