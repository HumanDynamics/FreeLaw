Chapter 1201
AUTHORIZED STRENGTHS AND DISTRIBUTION IN GRADE
 Authorized strengths: reserve components
(a)
 Whenever the authorized strength of a reserve component (other than the Coast Guard Reserve) is not prescribed by law, it shall be prescribed by the President.


(b)
 Subject to the authorized strength of the reserve component concerned, the authorized strength of each reserve component (other than the Coast Guard Reserve) in members in each grade is that which the Secretary concerned determines to be necessary to provide for mobilization requirements. The Secretary shall review these determinations at least once each year and revise them if he considers it necessary. However, a member of the reserve component concerned may not, as a result of such a determination, be reduced in the member’s reserve grade without the member’s consent.


“(a)
 
Requirement To Prescribe Reserve Component Force Structure
.—
The Secretary of each military department shall prescribe a force structure allowance for each reserve component under the jurisdiction of the Secretary. Each such force structure allowance for a reserve component—
“(1)
 shall be consistent with, but in no case include a number of personnel spaces that is less than, the authorized end strength for that component; and




“(2)
 shall be prescribed in accordance with historic service policies.




“(b)
 
Definition
.—
For purposes of this section, the term ‘force structure allowance’ means the number and types of units and organizations, and the number of authorized personnel spaces allocated to those units and organizations, in a military force.”


“(a)
 
Program Required
.—
The Secretary of the Army shall carry out a program to provide active component advisers to combat units, combat support units, and combat service support units in the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve that have a high priority for deployment on a time-phased troop deployment list or have another contingent high priority for deployment. The advisers shall be assigned to full-time duty in connection with organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training such units.


“(b)
 
Objectives of Program
.—
The objectives of the program are as follows:
“(1)
 To improve the readiness of units in the reserve components of the Army.




“(2)
 To increase substantially the number of active component personnel directly advising reserve component unit personnel.




“(3)
 To provide a basis for determining the most effective mix of reserve component personnel and active component personnel in organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training reserve component units.




“(4)
 To provide a basis for determining the most effective mix of active component officer and enlisted personnel in advising reserve component units regarding organizing, administering, recruiting, instructing, or training reserve component units.




“(c)
 
Personnel To Be Assigned
.—
(1)
 The Secretary shall assign not less than 3,500 active component personnel to serve as advisers under the program.




“(2)
 The Secretary of Defense may count toward the number of active component personnel required under paragraph (1) to be assigned to serve as advisers under the program under this section any active component personnel who are assigned to an active component unit (A) that was established principally for the purpose of providing dedicated training support to reserve component units, and (B) the primary mission of which is to provide such dedicated training support.




“(d)
 
Action on the Basis of Program Results
.—
Based on the experience under the pilot program, the Secretary of the Army shall by 
April 1, 1993
, submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a report containing the Secretary’s evaluation of the program to that date. As part of the budget submission for fiscal year 1995, the Secretary shall submit any recommendations for expansion or modification of the program, together with a proposal for any statutory changes that the Secretary considers necessary to implement the program on a permanent basis. In no case may the number of active duty personnel assigned to the program decrease below the number specified for the pilot program.”


“(a)
(1)
 The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a review of the various systems used to measure the readiness of reserve units of the Armed Forces and shall implement a measurement system for the active and reserve components of the Armed Forces to provide an objective and uniform evaluation of the readiness of all units of the Armed Forces. The measurement system should be designed to produce information adequate to provide comparisons concerning the readiness of all units. The system for evaluation of the readiness of a unit of an active component should incorporate the performance of any unit of a reserve component affiliated with the active component unit, including the effect of the reserve component unit on the mobilization capability of the active component unit.




“(2)
 Not later than 
March 31, 1985
, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives describing the results of the review under paragraph (1) and the measurement system implemented in accordance with that paragraph.




“(b)
(1)
 The Secretary of Defense, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, shall conduct a study to evaluate the feasibility of allocating equipment to units of reserve components based on a measure of effectiveness of such units. The study should consider the effects of allocating equipment by comparing units with similar deployment times and similar capabilities in terms of training and equipment rather than by comparing all reserve component units with each other. The study should be integrated with an evaluation of the system for measuring unit effectiveness to be implemented in accordance with subsection (a).




“(2)
 As part of the report under subsection (a)(2), the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the study carried out under paragraph (1).




“(c)
 It is the sense of Congress that the number of members of the Army Reserve and of the Army National Guard assigned to full-time manning duty should be increased to 14 percent of the total membership of the Army Reserve and of the Army National Guard, respectively, by fiscal year 1989.


“(d)
(1)
(A)
 The Secretary of Defense, acting through the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, shall conduct a study of the benefits of a longer training program for certain units of the reserve components and shall conduct a test of such a program. The test program should begin at the earliest realistic date.




“(B)
 In developing training programs for the reserve components, the Secretary shall give increased attention to innovative training technologies, techniques, and schedules that recognize the limitations on time and the geographic dispersion of the reserve components.






“(2)
 Not later than 
March 31, 1985
, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and House of Representatives describing the study under paragraph (1).

Determinations by Interpolation
.—
If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is between any two consecutive numbers in the first column of the appropriate table in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), the corresponding authorized strengths for each of the grades shown in that table for that component are determined by mathematical interpolation between the respective numbers of the two strengths. If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is more or less than the highest or lowest number, respectively, set forth in the first column of the appropriate table in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in that table at the same proportion as is reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.


(c)
 
Reallocations to Lower Grades
.—
Whenever the number of officers serving in any grade for duty described in subsection (a) is less than the number authorized for that grade under this section, the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under this section for any lower grade.

Determinations by Interpolation
.—
If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is between any two consecutive numbers in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the corresponding authorized strengths for each of the grades shown in that table for that component are determined by mathematical interpolation between the respective numbers of the two strengths. If the total number of members of a reserve component serving on full-time reserve component duty is more or less than the highest or lowest number, respectively, set forth in the first column of the table in subsection (a), the Secretary concerned shall fix the corresponding strengths for the grades shown in the table at the same proportion as is reflected in the nearest limit shown in the table.


(c)
 
Reallocations to Lower Grade
.—
Whenever the number of members serving in pay grade E–9 for duty described in subsection (a) is less than the number authorized for that grade under this section, the difference between the two numbers may be applied to increase the number authorized under this section for pay grade E–8.


(d)

(2)
 Whenever the Secretary exercises the authority provided in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives notice in writing of the adjustment made.
