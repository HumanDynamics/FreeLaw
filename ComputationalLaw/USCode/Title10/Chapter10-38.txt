(a)
 
Establishment

Each level shall, as a minimum, have both joint education criteria and joint experience criteria. The purpose of establishing such qualification levels is to ensure a systematic, progressive, career-long development of officers in joint matters and to ensure that officers serving as general and flag officers have the requisite experience and education to be highly proficient in joint matters.

 The number of officers who are joint qualified shall be determined by the Secretary of Defense, with the advice of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Such number shall be large enough to meet the requirements of subsection (d).

 meets such additional criteria as prescribed by the Secretary of Defense; and

 holds the grade of captain or, in the case of the Navy, lieutenant or a higher grade.

(B)
 successfully completes—
(i)
 a full tour of duty in a joint assignment, as described in

section 2155 of this title
.




(3)
 In the case of an officer in a grade below brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half), a waiver under paragraph (2) may be granted only if—
(A)
 the officer has completed two full tours of duty in a joint duty assignment, as described in 
section 664(f) of this title
, in such a manner as to demonstrate the officer’s mastery of knowledge, skills, and abilities on joint matters; and




(B)
 the Secretary of Defense determines that the types of joint duty experiences completed by the officer have been of sufficient breadth to prepare the officer adequately for service as a general or flag officer in a joint duty assignment position.

 In the case of a general or flag officer, a waiver under paragraph (2) may be granted only—
(A)
 under unusual circumstances justifying the variation from the education requirement under paragraph (1)(A); and

 under circumstances in which the waiver is necessary to meet a critical need of the armed forces, as determined by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

 In the case of officers in grades below brigadier general or rear admiral (lower half), the total number of waivers granted under paragraph (2) for officers in the same pay grade during a fiscal year may not exceed 10 percent of the total number of officers in that pay grade designated as joint qualified during that fiscal year.

 There may not be more than 32 general and flag officers on active duty at the same time who, while holding a general or flag officer position, were designated joint qualified (or were selected for the joint specialty before 
October 1, 2007
) and for whom a waiver was granted under paragraph (2).




(d)
