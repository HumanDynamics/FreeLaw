“(a)
 The Congress finds that a survivable land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system is vital to the security of the United States and to a stable strategic balance between the United States and the Soviet Union and that timely deployment of a new basing mode is essential to the survivability of this Nation’s land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is, therefore, the purpose of this section to commit the Congress to the development and deployment of the MX missile system, consisting of 200 missiles and 4,600 hardened shelters, and to insure that deployment of the entire MX system is carried out as soon as practicable.


“(b)
 The Secretary of Defense shall proceed immediately with the full-scale engineering development of the MX missile and a Multiple Protective Structure (MPS) basing mode and shall continue such development in a manner that will achieve an Initial Operational Capability of such missile and basing mode not later than 
December 31, 1986
.


“(c)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the initial phase of construction shall be limited to 2,300 protective shelters for the MX missile in the initial deployment area.


“(d)
 In accordance with the finding of the Congress expressed in subsection (a), a full system of at least 4,600 protective shelters may be deployed in the initial deployment area if, after completion of a study to be conducted by the Secretary of Defense of an alternate site for a portion of the system, it is determined by the Congress that adverse cost, military considerations, or other reasons preclude split basing.”


“(a)
 It is the sense of the Congress that maintaining a survivable land-based intercontinental ballistic missile system is vital to the security of the United States and that development of a new basing mode for land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles is necessary to assure the survivability of the land-based system. To this end, the development of the MX missile, together with a new basing mode for such missile, should proceed so as to achieve Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for both such missile and such basing mode at the earliest practicable date.


“(b)
 In addition, it is the sense of the Congress that the basing mode for the MX missile should be restricted to location on the least productive land available that is suitable for such purpose.


“(c)
 In accordance with the sense of Congress expressed in subsection (a), the Secretary of Defense shall proceed immediately with full scale engineering development of the missile basing mode known as the Multiple Protective Structure (MPS) system concurrently with full scale engineering development of the MX missile, unless and until the Secretary of Defense certifies to the Congress that an alternative basing mode is militarily or technologically superior to, and is more cost effective than, the MPS system or the President informs the Congress that in his view the MPS system is not consistent with United States national security interests.


“(d)
 Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or restrict the study of alternative basing modes for land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.”


“(a)
 The Secretary of Defense is authorized to assist communities located near the TRIDENT Support Site Bangor, Washington, in meeting the costs of providing increased municipal services and facilities to the residents of such communities, if the Secretary determines that there is an immediate and substantial increase in the need for such services and facilities in such communities as a direct result of work being carried out in connection with the construction, installation, testing, and operation of the TRIDENT Weapon System and that an unfair and excessive financial burden will be incurred by such communities as a result of the increased need for such services and facilities.


“(b)
 The Secretary of Defense shall carry out the provisions of this section through existing Federal programs. The Secretary is authorized to supplement funds made available under such Federal programs to the extent necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, and is authorized to provide financial assistance to communities described in subsection (a) of this section to help such communities pay their share of the costs under such programs. The heads of all departments and agencies concerned shall cooperate fully with the Secretary of Defense in carrying out the provisions of this section on a priority basis.


“(c)
 In determining the amount of financial assistance to be made available under this section to any local community for any community service or facility, the Secretary of Defense shall consult with the head of the department or agency of the Federal Government concerned with the type of service or facility for which financial assistance is being made available and shall take into consideration (1) the time lag between the initial impact of increased population in any such community and any increase in the local tax base which will result from such increased population, (2) the possible temporary nature of the increased population and the long-range cost impact on the permanent residents of any such community, and (3) such other pertinent factors as the Secretary of Defense deems appropriate.


“(d)
 Any funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for the fiscal year beginning 
July 1, 1974
, for carrying out the TRIDENT Weapon System shall be utilized by the Secretary of Defense in carrying out the provisions of this section to the extent that funds are unavailable under other Federal programs. Funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for any fiscal year beginning after 
June 30, 1975
, for carrying out the TRIDENT Weapon System may, to the extent specifically authorized in an annual Military Construction Authorization Act, be utilized by the Secretary of Defense in carrying out the provision of this section to the extent that funds are unavailable under other Federal programs.


“(e)
