 Stay of suit
(a)
 Whenever in time of war the Secretary of the Navy certifies to a court, or to a judge of a court, in which a suit described in 
section 7721 of this title
 is pending, that the prosecution of the suit would tend to endanger the security of naval operations in the war, or would tend to interfere with those operations, all further proceedings in the suit shall be stayed.


(b)
 A stay under this section does not suspend the issue of process to take or preserve evidence to be used in the trial or prevent the completion of action under similar process issued before the stay.


 Stay of proceedings for preserving evidence after stay of suit
If, at the time of certification under 
 Stay of proceedings for taking evidence before suit is filed
(a)
 If in time of war, with respect to any claim against the United States on which a suit described in 
section 7721 of this title
 would lie, the Secretary of the Navy certifies to the court, or to a judge of the court, in which proceedings are pending for—
(1)
 the granting of a dedimus potestatem to take depositions;




(2)
 a direction to take depositions in perpetuam rei memoriam; or




(3)
 the taking of depositions or production of evidence pursuant to such dedimus potestatem or direction, or pursuant to any other proceedings for the purpose;





that the proceedings would tend to endanger the security of the United States or any of its naval or military operations in the war, or would tend to interfere with those operations, then the proceedings may not be started or, if they have been started, they shall, when the certificate is filed, be stayed.


(b)
 The time during which a claimant may file suit of the type described in 
section 7721 of this title
 is computed by excluding the time during which a stay under this section or any extension of such a stay is in effect.


 Stay extended or shortened
The Secretary of the Navy, when a stay under this chapter is in effect, may file with the court, or a judge of the court, a certificate extending or shortening the time stated in the prior certificate. The filing of such a new certificate extends or shortens the stay to the period specified in the new certificate or terminates the stay if the new certificate so states.
 Reconsideration of stay
(a)
 A claimant or party who considers himself adversely affected by a stay under this chapter may serve a written notice on the Secretary of the Navy at Washington, D.C., requesting him to reconsider the stay previously issued and to issue a new certificate. The notice shall identify the stay by means of an attached copy of the certificate of the Secretary or a sufficient description of the stay. The notice may not contain any recital of the facts or circumstances involved.


(b)
 Within ten days after receiving notice under this section, the Secretary or his designee shall hold a secret meeting at which the claimant or party, or his representative, may present any facts and arguments he thinks material.


(c)
 Within ten days after a hearing under this section, the Secretary shall file with the court that ordered the stay a new certificate stating whether the stay is then to be terminated or for what period the stay is to continue in effect. If the Secretary fails to file a new certificate, the court, upon application by the claimant or party, shall issue an order directing the Secretary to file a new certificate within a specified time.


 Duration of stay
A stay of proceedings under this chapter remains in effect for the period specified in the certificate upon which it was based unless the Secretary of the Navy issues a new certificate under section 7725 or 7726 of this title changing the termination date. However, a stay under this chapter may not remain in force longer than six months after the cessation of hostilities.
 Restricted certificate
The Secretary of the Navy may restrict a certificate issued under this chapter so that it stays only the taking of testimony of certain witnesses or the production of evidence on certain subjects. The proceedings not stayed may continue.
 Investigation before issue of certificate
The Secretary of the Navy may not issue a certificate under this chapter until he satisfies himself by investigation that it is necessary.
 Evidence admissible when witness is not available
