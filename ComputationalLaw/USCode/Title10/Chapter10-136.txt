It is the sense of Congress that—
“(1)
 the Secretary of Defense should ensure that the future-years defense program provides for sufficient funding to develop and deploy an enhanced Global Positioning System in accordance with the priority declared in subsection (a); and




“(2)
 the Secretary of Transportation should provide sufficient funding to support additional civil frequencies for the Global Positioning System and other enhancements of the system for civil users.

Findings
.—
Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 The Global Positioning System (consisting of a constellation of satellites and associated facilities capable of providing users on earth with a highly precise statement of their location on earth) makes significant contributions to the attainment of the national security and foreign policy goals of the United States, the safety and efficiency of international transportation, and the economic growth, trade, and productivity of the United States.




“(2)
 The infrastructure for the Global Positioning System (including both space and ground segments of the infrastructure) is vital to the effectiveness of United States and allied military forces and to the protection of the national security interests of the United States.




“(3)
 In addition to having military uses, the Global Positioning System has essential civil, commercial, and scientific uses.




“(4)
 As a result of the increasing demand of civil, commercial, and scientific users of the Global Positioning System—
“(A)
 there has emerged in the United States a new commercial industry to provide Global Positioning System equipment and related services to the many and varied users of the system; and




“(B)
 there have been rapid technical advancements in Global Positioning System equipment and services that have contributed significantly to reductions in the cost of the Global Positioning System and increases in the technical capabilities and availability of the system for military uses.






“(5)
 It is in the national interest of the United States for the United States—
“(A)
 to support continuation of the multiple-use character of the Global Positioning System;




“(B)
 to promote broader acceptance and use of the Global Positioning System and the technological standards that facilitate expanded use of the system for civil purposes;




“(C)
 to coordinate with other countries to ensure (i) efficient management of the electromagnetic spectrum used by the Global Positioning System, and (ii) protection of that spectrum in order to prevent disruption of signals from the system and interference with that portion of the electromagnetic spectrum used by the system; and




“(D)
 to encourage open access in all international markets to the Global Positioning System and supporting equipment, services, and techniques.






“(b)
 
International Cooperation
.—
Congress urges the President to promote the security of the United States and its allies, the public safety, and commercial interests by taking the following steps:
“(1)
 Undertaking a coordinated effort within the executive branch to seek to establish the Global Positioning System, and augmentations to the system, as a worldwide resource.




“(2)
 Seeking to enter into international agreements to establish signal and service standards that protect the Global Positioning System from disruption and interference.




“(3)
 Undertaking efforts to eliminate any barriers to, and other restrictions of foreign governments on, peaceful uses of the Global Positioning System.




“(4)
 Requiring that any proposed international agreement involving nonmilitary use of the Global Positioning System or any augmentation to the system not be agreed to by the United States unless the proposed agreement has been reviewed by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary of Commerce (acting as the Interagency Global Positioning System Executive Board established by Presidential Decision Directive NSTC–6, dated 
March 28, 1996
).”




“(a)
 
Conditional Prohibition on Use of Selective Availability Feature
.—
Except as provided in subsection (b), after
