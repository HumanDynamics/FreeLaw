Findings

“(1)
 The United States has stated its support for a ban on antipersonnel landmines that is global in scope and verifiable.




“(2)
 On 
May 16, 1996
, the President announced that the United States, as a matter of policy, would eliminate its stockpile of non-self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, except those used for training purposes and in Korea, and that the United States would reserve the right to use self-destructing antipersonnel landmines in the event of conflict.




“(3)
 On 
May 16, 1996
, the President also announced that the United States would lead an effort to negotiate an international treaty permanently banning the use of all antipersonnel landmines.




“(4)
 The United States is currently participating at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament in negotiations aimed at achieving a global ban on the use of antipersonnel landmines.




“(5)
 On 
August 18, 1997
, the administration agreed to participate in international negotiations sponsored by Canada (the so-called ‘Ottawa process’) designed to achieve a treaty that would outlaw the production, use, and sale of antipersonnel landmines.




“(6)
 On 
September 17, 1997
, the President announced that the United States would not sign the antipersonnel landmine treaty concluded in Oslo, Norway, by participants in the Ottawa process because the treaty would not provide a geographic exception to allow the United States to stockpile and use antipersonnel landmines in Korea or an exemption that would preserve the ability of the United States to use mixed antitank mine systems which could be used to deter an armored assault against United States forces.




“(7)
 The President also announced a change in United States policy whereby the United States—
“(A)
 would no longer deploy antipersonnel landmines, including self-destructing antipersonnel landmines, by 2003, except in Korea;




“(B)
 would seek to field alternatives by that date, or by 2006 in the case of Korea;




“(C)
 would undertake a new initiative in the United Nations Conference on Disarmament to establish a global ban on the transfer of antipersonnel landmines; and




“(D)
 would increase its current humanitarian demining activities around the world.






“(8)
 The President’s decision would allow the continued use by United States forces of self-destructing antipersonnel landmines that are used as part of a mixed antitank mine system.




“(9)
 Under existing law (as provided in 
section 580 of Public Law 104–107
; 
110 Stat. 751
), on 
February 12, 1999
, the United States will implement a one-year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States forces except along internationally recognized national borders or in demilitarized zones within a perimeter marked area that is monitored by military personnel and protected by adequate means to ensure the exclusion of civilians.




“(b)
 
Sense of Congress
.—
It is the sense of Congress that—
“(1)
 the United States should not implement a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines by United States Armed Forces in a manner that would endanger United States personnel or undermine the military effectiveness of United States Armed Forces in executing their missions; and




“(2)
 the United States should pursue the development of alternatives to self-destructing antipersonnel landmines.
