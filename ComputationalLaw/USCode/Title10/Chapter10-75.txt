 Subject to paragraph (2), the determination that a circumstance exists under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) shall be made by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner.




(2)
 A commander may make the determination that a circumstance exists under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) and require a forensic pathology investigation under this section without regard to a determination made by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner if—
