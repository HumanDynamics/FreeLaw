, may not be less than the monthly retired pay to which he would be entitled if he had become entitled to retired pay at an earlier date based on the grade in which the member is retired, adjusted to reflect any applicable increases in such pay under this section. In computing the amount of retired pay to which such a member or former member would have been entitled on that earlier date, the computation shall be based on his grade, length of service, and the rate of basic pay applicable to him at that time, except that such computation may not be based on a rate of basic pay for a grade higher than the grade in which the member is retired.

However, in the case of a member or former member whose retired pay is computed subject to 
section 1407(f) of this title
, paragraph (1) (rather than the preceding sentence) shall apply in the same manner as if the member or former member first became a member of a uniformed service before 
September 8, 1980
, but only with respect to a calculation as of the date on which the member or former member first became entitled to retired pay.

In General
.—
The fiscal year 1995 increase in military retired pay shall (notwithstanding subparagraph (B) of

 The term ‘fiscal year 1995 increase in military retired pay’ means the increase in retired pay that, pursuant to paragraph (1) of 
section 1401a(b) of title 10
, United States Code, becomes effective on 
December 1, 1994
.




“(2)

“(c)
 
Limitation

March 1, 1995
) such amount as is necessary to offset increased outlays to be made from that fund during fiscal year 1995 by reason of the provisions of subsection (a).

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 Congress, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 [
Pub. L. 103–66
, see Tables for classification], changed the effective dates for future cost-of-living adjustments for military retired pay and for Federal civilian retirement annuities, which (before that Act) were provided by law to be made effective on December 1 each year.




“(2)
 The timing, and the percentage of increase, of military and Federal civilian retirees’ cost-of-living adjustments have been linked for decades.




“(3)
 The effect of the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 was to abandon the longstanding congressional practice of treating military and Federal civilian retirees identically in matters related to cost-of-living adjustments.




“(b)
 
Sense of Congress
.—
In light of the findings in subsection (a), it is the sense of Congress that—
“(1)
 as a matter of simple equity and fairness, it is imperative that cost-of-living adjustments in retirement benefits for military and Federal civilian retirees be returned to an identical schedule as soon as possible, but not later than 
January 1, 1999
;




“(2)
 if after 
October 1, 1998
, there is, by law, a difference between the date on which a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal civilian retirees takes effect and the date on which a cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees takes effect, then the difference in those effective dates should be eliminated by requiring that cost-of-living adjustments for both classes of retirees become effective on the earlier of the two dates; and




“(3)
 if after 
October 1, 1998
, there is, by law, a difference between the first month for which a cost-of-living adjustment for civilian retirees is payable and the first month for which a cost-of-living adjustment for military retirees is payable, then the difference in the months for which those adjustments are first payable should be eliminated by requiring that the cost-of-living adjustments for both classes of retirees first become payable for the earlier of the two months.”




“(a)
 
Authority
.—
The Secretary concerned may, for purposes of the computation under 
section 1401a(f) of title 10
, United States Code, of the retired pay of military retirees described in subsection (b), waive any administrative time-in-grade regulation (as described in subsection (d)) that would otherwise apply to such computation. Any such waiver may be made retroactive, in the case of any such retiree, to the date on which that retiree initially became entitled to retired pay.


“(b)
 
Covered Retirees
.—
This section applies to any military retiree—
“(1)
 who initially became entitled to retired pay on or after 
January 1, 1971
, and before the date of the enactment of this Act [
Oct. 5, 1994
];




“(2)
 whose retired pay, by reason of the provisions of 
section 1401a(f) of title 10
, United States Code (the so-called ‘Tower amendment’), was initially computed as an amount greater than would have been the case but for that section; and




“(3)
 who, as of the earlier computation date applicable to that retiree—
“(A)
 in the case of an individual retired in an enlisted grade, had served in the grade in which the retiree retired for a period that was less than the period prescribed by the applicable administrative time-in-grade requirement described in subsection (d); and




“(B)
 in the case of an individual retired in an officer grade—
“(i)
 was subject to an administrative time-in-grade requirement described in subsection (d) that established a time-in-grade requirement that was longer than the statutory time-in-grade requirement applicable to that member; and




“(ii)
 had served in the grade in which the retiree retired for a period that was less than the period prescribed by such administrative time-in-grade requirement but not less than the statutory time-in-grade requirement applicable to that member.








“(c)
 
Earlier Computation Date
.—
For purposes of subsection (b)(3), the earlier computation date applicable to a military retiree is the date that (under such section 1401a(f) as in effect on the date of the member’s retirement) was the ‘earlier date’ that was used as the basis for the computation of the retiree’s retired pay.


“(d)
 
Regulations Subject to Waiver
.—
A regulation that may be waived under subsection (a) is any regulation (not required by law) that establishes a minimum period of time that a member of the Armed Forces must have served in a grade on active duty in order to be eligible to retire in that grade.


“(e)
 
Scope of Waiver Authority
.—

”


“(a)
(1)
 The increase in the retired and retainer pay of members and former members of the uniformed services which but for this section would be made effective 
September 1, 1980
, under the provisions of paragraph (2)(B) of 
section 1401a(b) of title 10
, United States Code, shall not be made.




“(2)
(A)
 In making the determination required by the provisions of paragraph (1)(A) of 
section 1401a(b) of title 10
, United States Code, to be made on 
January 1, 1981
, or within a reasonable time thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall determine the percent change in the index (as such term is defined in 
section 1401a(a) of title 10
, United States Code) published for December 1980 over the index published for December 1979 (rather than over the index published for June 1980).




“(B)
 The increase in the retired and retainer pay of members and former members of the uniformed services to be made effective 
March 1, 1981
, under the provisions of paragraph (2)(A) of such section shall, in lieu of the increase prescribed by such paragraph, be the percent change computed under subparagraph (A), adjusted to the nearest ⅒ of one percent.






“(3)
 The President shall by Executive order provide for only one cost-of-living adjustment in the annuities paid under the Central Intelligence Agency [Retirement] Act of 1964 for Certain Employees ([former] 
50 U.S.C. 403
 note) during the period beginning on 
September 1, 1980
, and ending on 
August 31, 1981
. Such adjustment shall be effective 
March 1, 1981
, and shall be made in the same manner and percentage as the adjustment provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) for the retired and retainer pay of members and former members of the uniformed services.




“(4)
 Paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall not take effect unless similar legislation is enacted which provides for only one cost-of-living increase in annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, during the period beginning on 
September 1, 1980
, and ending on 
August 31, 1981
.




“(b)
(1)
 Effective 
August 31, 1981
, but subject to paragraph (2), section 1401a(b), of title 10, United States Code, relating to adjustment of retired pay and retainer pay to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index, is amended to read as follows:
“ ‘(b) Each time that an increase is made under 
section 8340(b) of title 5
 in annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of such title, the Secretary of Defense shall at the same time increase the retired and retainer pay of members and former members of the armed forces by the same percent as the percentage by which annuities are increased under such section.’.






“(2)
 The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall not take effect unless legislation is enacted which provides for the adjustment of annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, on a once-a-year basis. In the event such legislation is enacted, such amendment shall become effective with respect to adjustments in the retired pay and retainer pay of members and former members of the uniformed services at the same time that the legislation providing for such a once-a-year adjustment of annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, becomes effective.




“(3)
 If legislation described in paragraph (2) is enacted to provide for the adjustment of annuities paid under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, on a once-a-year basis, the President shall exercise the authority vested in him under section 292 of the Central Intelligence Agency [Retirement] Act of 1964 for Certain Employees ([former] 
50 U.S.C. 403
 note) to provide for cost-of-living adjustments in the annuities paid under such Act on an identical basis.




“(4)
 If at the time the first adjustment in retired and retainer pay is made under 
section 1401a(b) of title 10
, United States Code, as amended by paragraph (1) of this subsection, the period upon which the most recent adjustment in such retired and retainer pay was computed is not identical to the period upon which the most recent adjustment in annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, was computed, then the percentage increase to be made under such section 1401a(b) at the time of the first such adjustment shall be computed in the same manner as the percentage increase made at the same time in annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, is computed, but shall be based on the period beginning on the last day of the period upon which the most recent adjustment in such retired and retainer pay was computed and ending on the last day of the period upon which the adjustment being made at the same time in annuities under such subchapter III is computed. The President shall by Executive order provide for a similar computation of the adjustment in annuities paid under the Central Intelligence Agency [Retirement] Act of 1964 for Certain Employees ([former] 
50 U.S.C. 403
 note) which is made at the same time as the increase in retired and retainer pay to which the preceeding [preceding] sentence is applicable.




“(c)
 For the purposes of this section, the term ‘uniformed services’ means—
“(1)
 the Armed Forces; and




“(2)
 the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and of the Public Health Service.”




(a)
 the retired pay of any individual who served as sergeant major of the Marine Corps and who completed such service before

, shall be computed based upon a rate of basic pay of the sum of (1) the highest rate of basic pay to which such individual was entitled while so serving, and (2) $150.


“(b)
 For the purpose of computing any adjustment under 
section 1401a of title 10
, United States Code, in the retired pay of any individual whose retired pay is affected by subsection (a), the rate of basic pay provided under such subsection for the purpose of computing the retired pay of such individual shall be considered to have been the rate of basic pay applicable to such individual at the time of his retirement, and any adjustment under such section 1401a in the retired pay of such individual before 
September 30, 1978
, shall be readjusted to reflect such rate of basic pay.


 (a)
 Any change in the retired pay of any individual by reason of the enactment of this Act shall be effective for months beginning after 
September 30, 1978
.


“(b)
 The enactment of this Act shall not reduce the retired pay of any individual.”

section 1401a(b) of title 10
, United States Code, by the same percentage rates, consecutively compounded, that the retired pay or retainer pay of members and former members of the Armed Forces entitled to retired pay or retainer pay since
