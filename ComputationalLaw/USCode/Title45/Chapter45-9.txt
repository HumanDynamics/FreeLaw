(h)
(1)
 The term “compensation” means any form of money remuneration paid to an individual for services rendered as an employee to one or more employers or as an employee representative, including remuneration paid for time lost as an employee, but remuneration paid for time lost shall be deemed earned in the month in which such time is lost. A payment made by an employer to an individual through the employer’s payroll shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be compensation for service rendered by such individual as an employee of the employer in the period with respect to which the payment is made. Compensation earned in any calendar month before 1947 shall be deemed paid in such month regardless of whether or when payment will have been in fact made, and compensation earned in any calendar year after 1946 but paid after the end of such calendar year shall be deemed to be compensation paid in the calendar year in which it will have been earned if it is so reported by the employer before February 1 of the next succeeding calendar year or if the employee establishes, subject to the provisions of 
section 231h of this title

If a payment is made by an employer with respect to a personal injury and includes pay for time lost, the total payment shall be deemed to be paid for time lost unless, at the time of payment, a part of such payment is specifically apportioned to factors other than time lost, in which event only such part of the payment as is not so apportioned shall be deemed to be paid for time lost.




(3)
 Solely for purposes of determining amounts to be included in the compensation of an employee, the term “compensation” shall also include cash tips received by an employee in any calendar month in the course of his employment by an employer unless the amount of such cash tips is less than $20.




(4)
 Tips included as compensation by reason of the provisions of subdivision (3) shall be deemed to be paid at the time a written statement including such tips is furnished to the employer pursuant to section 6053(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [
26 U.S.C. 6053(a)
] or, if no statement including such tips is so furnished, at the time received. Tips so deemed to be paid in any month shall be deemed paid for services rendered in such month.




(5)
 In determining compensation, there shall be attributable as compensation paid to an employee in calendar months in which he is in military service creditable under 
section 231b(i)(2) of this title
, in addition to any other compensation paid to him with respect to such months—
(i)
 for each such calendar month prior to 1968, $160;




(ii)
 for each such calendar month after 1967 and prior to 1975, $260; and




(iii)
 for each such calendar month after 1974, the amount which is creditable as such individual’s “wages” under section 209(d) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 409(d)
].

 tips, except as is provided under subdivision (3) of this subsection;




(ii)
 remuneration for service which is performed by a non-resident alien individual for the period he is temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F) or (J) of 
section 1101(a)(15) of title 8
, as amended, and which is performed to carry out the purpose specified in subparagraph (F) or (J), as the case may be;




(iii)
 remuneration earned in the service of a local lodge or division of a railway-labor-organization employer with respect to any calendar month in which the amount of such remuneration is less than $25;




(iv)
 remuneration for service as a delegate to a national or international convention of a railway-labor-organization employer if the individual rendering such service has not previously rendered service, other than as such a delegate, which may be included in his “years of service;”




(v)
 the amount of any payment (including any amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities, or into a fund, to provide for any such payment) made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents under a plan or system established by an employer which makes provision for his employees generally (or for his employees generally and their dependents) or for a class or classes of his employees (or for a class or classes of his employees and their dependents), on account of sickness or accident disability or medical or hospitalization expenses in connection with sickness or accident disability; and




(vi)
 an amount paid specifically—either as an advance, as reimbursement or allowance—for traveling or other bona fide and necessary expenses incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in the business of the employer provided any such payment is identified by the employer either by a separate payment or by specifically indicating the separate amounts where both wages and expense reimbursement or allowance are combined in a single payment.






(7)
 The term “compensation” includes any separation allowance or subsistence allowance paid under any benefit schedule provided under section 701 of title VII of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 [

 Annuity eligibility requirements
(a)
 Individuals eligible for annuities; disability standards; proof of continued disability
(1)
 The following-described individuals, if they shall have completed ten years of service (or, for purposes of paragraphs (i), (iii), and (v), five years of service, all of which accrues after 
December 31, 1995
) and shall have filed application for annuities, shall, subject to the conditions set forth in subsections (e), (f), and (h) of this section, be entitled to annuities in the amounts provided under 
section 231b of this title
—
(i)
 individuals who have attained retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416
(
l
)]);




(ii)
 individuals who have attained the age of sixty and have completed thirty years of service;




(iii)
 individuals who have attained the age of sixty-two and have completed less than thirty years of service, but the annuity of such individuals shall be reduced by 
1
⁄
180
 for each of the first 36 months that he or she is under retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416
(
l
)]) when the annuity begins to accrue and by 
1
⁄
240
 for each additional month that he or she is under retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act) when the annuity begins to accrue;




(iv)
 individuals who have a current connection with the railroad industry, whose permanent physical or mental condition is such as to be disabling for work in their regular occupation, and who (A) have completed twenty years of service or (B) have attained the age of sixty; and




(v)
 individuals whose permanent physical or mental condition is such that they are unable to engage in any regular employment.






(2)
 For the purposes of paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1), the Board, with the cooperation of employers and employees, shall secure the establishment of standards determining the physical and mental conditions which permanently disqualify employees for work in the several occupations in the railroad industry, and the Board, employers, and employees shall cooperate in the promotion of the greatest practicable degree of uniformity in the standards applied by the several employers. An individual’s condition shall be deemed to be disabling for work in his regular occupation if he will have been disqualified by his employer for service in his regular occupation in accordance with the applicable standards so established; if the employee will not have been so disqualified by his employer, the Board shall determine whether his condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation in accordance with the standards generally established; and, if the employee’s regular occupation is not one with respect to which standards will have been established, the standards relating to a reasonably comparable occupation shall be used. If there is no such comparable occupation, the Board shall determine whether the employee’s condition is disabling for work in his regular occupation by determining whether under the practices generally prevailing in industries in which such occupation exists such condition is a permanent disqualification for work in such occupation. For purposes of this subdivision and paragraph (iv) of subdivision (1), an employee’s “regular occupation” shall be deemed to be the occupation in which he will have been engaged in more calendar months than the calendar months in which he will have been engaged in any other occupation during the last preceding five calendar years, whether or not consecutive, in each of which years he will have earned wages or salary, except that, if an employee establishes that during the last fifteen consecutive calendar years he will have been engaged in another occupation in one-half or more of all the months in which he will have earned wages or salary, he may claim such other occupation as his regular occupation.




(3)
 Such satisfactory proof shall be made from time to time as prescribed by the Board, of the disability provided for in paragraph (iv) or (v) of subdivision (1) and of the continuance of such disability (according to the standards applied in the establishment of such disability) until the employee attains retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416
(
l
)]). If the individual fails to comply with the requirements prescribed by the Board as to proof of the continuance of the disability until he attains retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act), his right to an annuity by reason of such disability shall, except for good cause shown to the Board, cease, but without prejudice to his rights to any subsequent annuity to which he may be entitled.




(4)
 An individual who is entitled to an annuity under paragraph (v) of subdivision (1), but who does not have at least ten years of service, shall, prior to the month in which the individual attains age 62, be entitled only to an annuity amount computed under 
section 231b(a) of this title
 (without regard to 
section 231b(a)(2) of this title
) or 
section 231b(f)(3) of this title
. Upon attainment of age 62, such an individual may also be entitled to an annuity amount computed under

42 U.S.C. 301

(2)
 The period referred to in clause (B) of subdivision (1)(i) is the period (i) beginning with the latest of (A) the month of the employee’s death, (B) in the case of a widow, the last month for which she was entitled to an annuity under paragraph (ii) of subdivision (1) as the widow of the deceased employee, or (C) the month in which the widow’s or widower’s previous entitlement to an annuity as the widow or widower of the deceased employee terminated because her or his disability had ceased and (ii) ending with the month before the month in which she or he attains age sixty, or, if earlier, with the close of the eighty-fourth month following the month with which such period began.




(3)
 For purposes of paragraph (i) or (iii) of subdivision (1), a widow, widower, or child shall be under a disability if her or his permanent physical or mental condition is such that she or he is unable to engage in any regular employment. The provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section as to the proof of disability shall apply with regard to determinations with respect to disability under subdivision (1).




(4)
 In determining for purposes of this subsection and subdivision (3) of subsection (c) of this section whether an applicant is the wife, husband, widow, widower, child, or parent of a deceased employee as claimed, the rules set forth in section 216(h) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416(h)
] shall be applied deeming, for this purpose, individuals entitled to an annuity under subsection (c) of this section to be entitled to benefits under subsection (b) or (c) of section 202 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402
] and individuals entitled to an annuity under paragraph (i) or (ii) of subsection (d)(1) of this section to be entitled to a benefit under subsection (e), (f), or (g) of section 202 of the Social Security Act.

 of the Social Security Act) shall be deemed (for purposes of determining his continuing or initial entitlement to an annuity under this subsection) not to have attained such age until the first day of the first month following the end of the quarter or semester in which he is enrolled at such time (or, if the elementary or secondary school in which he is enrolled is not operated on a quarter or semester system, until the first day of the first month following the completion of the course in which he is enrolled or until the first day of the third month beginning after such time, whichever first occurs).




(e)
 Compensated service; rights to return
(1)
 No individual shall be entitled to an annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section until he shall have ceased to render compensated service to an employer as defined in 
section 231(a) of this title
.




(2)
 An annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be paid only if the applicant shall have relinquished such rights as he may have to return to the service of an employer: 
Provided, however
, That this requirement shall not apply to individuals mentioned in paragraphs (iv) and (v) of subsection (a)(1) of this section prior to attaining retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416
(
l
)]): 
Provided further
, That, notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding proviso and of clause (i) of subsection (c)(1) of this section, an annuity shall be paid to the spouse of an individual only if such individual shall have satisfied the requirements of this subdivision without regard to the preceding proviso: 
And provided further
, That, notwithstanding the provisions of the first proviso of this subdivision and of clause (iii) of subsection (b)(1) of this section, a supplemental annuity shall be paid to an individual only if such individual shall have satisfied the requirements of this subdivision without regard to the first proviso thereof.




(3)
 No annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section or supplemental annuity under subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be paid with respect to any month in which an individual in receipt of an annuity or supplemental annuity thereunder shall render compensated service to an employer. Individuals receiving annuities under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall report to the Board immediately all such compensated service.




(4)
 No annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be paid to an individual with respect to any month in which the individual is under retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416
(
l
)]) and is paid more than the monthly allowable earnings as defined in the section (after deduction of disability related work expenses) from employment or self-employment of any form: 
Provided, however
, That for purposes of this subdivision, if a payment in any one calendar month is for accruals in more than one calendar month, such payment shall be deemed to have been paid in each of the months in which accrued to the extent accrued in such month. Any such individual under the retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act) shall report to the Board any such payment of earnings for such employment or self-employment before receipt and acceptance of an annuity for the second month following the month of such payment. A deduction shall be imposed, with respect to any such individual who fails to make such report, in the annuity or annuities otherwise due the individual, in an amount equal to the amount of the annuity for each month in which he is paid such earnings in such employment or self-employment, except that the first deduction imposed pursuant to this sentence shall in no case exceed an amount equal to the amount of the annuity otherwise due for the first month with respect to which the deduction is imposed. If pursuant to the first sentence of this subdivision an annuity was not paid to an individual with respect to one or more months in any calendar year, and it is subsequently established that the total amount of such individual’s earnings during such year as determined in accordance with that sentence (but exclusive of earnings for services described in subdivision (3)) did not exceed the amount of earnings computed by totaling the monthly allowable earnings as determined under this section for each month in the year (after deduction of disability related work expenses), the annuity with respect to such month or months, and any deduction imposed by reason of the failure to report earnings for such month or months under the third sentence of this subdivision, shall then be payable. If the total amount of such individual’s earnings during such year (exclusive of earnings for services as described in subdivision (3) and after deduction of disability related work expenses) is in excess of the annual allowable earnings amount, the number of months in such year with respect to which an annuity is not payable by reason of the first and third sentences shall not exceed the number of months derived by dividing the amount by which such annual earnings exceed the annual allowable earnings amount by the monthly allowable earning amount determined under this section. If the computation under the preceding sentence results in a remainder greater than or equal to one-half, the number of months for which an annuity is not payable as determined under the preceding sentence shall be increased by one. The annual allowable earnings amount shall be computed by totaling the amount of monthly allowable earnings as determined under the first sentence of this subdivision for each month in the calender

 year. If the amount of the individual’s annuity has changed during the calendar year, any payment of annuities which become payable solely by reason of the limitations in the preceding three sentences shall be made first with respect to the month or months for which the annuity is larger. For purposes of this subdivision, “the monthly allowable earnings” shall be $700, except that for each year after 2007, “the monthly allowable earnings” amount shall be the larger of the amount for the previous year or the amount calculated by multiplying $700 by the ratio of the national average wage index for the year 2 calender 
6
 years before the year for which the amount is being calculated to the national average wage index for the year 2005. The amount so computed will be rounded to the next higher multiple of $10 where such amount is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest multiple of $10 in any other case.




(5)
 The annuity of a spouse or divorced wife under subsection (c) of this section shall, with respect to any month, be subject to the same provisions of this subsection as the individual’s annuity. In addition, the annuity of a spouse under subsection (c) of this section shall not be payable for any month if the individual’s annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section is not payable for such month by reason of the provisions of this subsection.




(f)
 Deductions on account of work
(1)
 That portion of the individual’s annuity as is computed under 
section 231b(a) of this title
 on the basis of (A) his compensation and years of service subsequent to 
December 31, 1974
, and (B) his wages and self-employment income derived from employment and self-employment under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] and that portion of the individual’s annuity as is computed under 
section 231b(h) of this title
 shall be subject to deductions on account of work pursuant to the provisions of section 203 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 403
] in the same manner as if such portion of such annuity were a monthly insurance benefit under that Act: 
Provided, however
, That the provisions of this subdivision shall be applicable to the annuity of an individual only if such individual would be fully insured under the Social Security Act on the basis of wages and self-employment income derived from employment and self-employment under that Act and on the basis of compensation derived from service as an employee after 
December 31, 1974
, if such service as an employee had been included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act. Any person in receipt of an annuity subject to deduction under this subsection shall report to the Board the receipt of excess earnings as defined in paragraph (3) of section 203(f) of the Social Security Act.




(2)
 That portion of the spouse’s or divorced wife’s annuity under subsection (c) of this section which is derived from the portion of the individual’s annuity subject to deductions under subdivision (1) and that portion of the spouse’s or divorced wife’s annuity as is computed under 
section 231c(e) of this title
 shall be subject to deductions on account of work pursuant to the provisions of section 203 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.S. 403] in the same manner as if such portion of such spouse’s or divorced wife’s annuity were a monthly insurance benefit under that Act. In addition, such portion of the spouse’s or divorced wife’s annuity shall be subject to deductions if the individual’s annuity is subject to deductions under subdivision (1) in the same manner as if such portion of such spouse’s or divorced wife’s annuity were a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.].




(3)
 Deductions shall not be made pursuant to subdivision (1) from that portion of an individual’s annuity as is computed under 
section 231b(a) of this title
 for any month in which the annuity of such individual is reduced pursuant to 
section 231b(m) of this title
. This subdivision shall be disregarded in determining the applicability and amount of deductions in a spouse’s annuity pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.




(4)
 Deductions shall not be made pursuant to subdivision (2) from that portion of a spouse’s annuity as is computed under 
section 231c(a) of this title
 for any month in which the annuity of such spouse is reduced due to entitlement to a benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.].




(5)
 If an annuity begins to accrue on other than the first day of a month, subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall not apply in the year the annuity begins to accrue if the annuitant has no earnings in excess of the monthly exempt amount in such year after the annuity beginning date.




(6)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B)—
(i)
 that portion of the annuity for any month of an individual as is computed under 
section 231b(b) of this title
 and as adjusted under 
section 231b(g) of this title
, plus any supplemental amount for such month under 
section 231b(e) of this title
, and that portion of the annuity for any month of a spouse as is computed under 
section 231c(b) of this title
 and as adjusted under 
section 231c(d) of this title
, shall each be subject to a deduction of $1 for each $2 of compensation received by such individual from compensated service rendered in such month to the last person, or persons, by whom such individual was employed before the date on which the annuity of such individual under subsection (a)(1) of this section began to accrue; and




(ii)
 that portion of the annuity for any month of a spouse as is computed under 
section 231c(b) of this title
 and as adjusted under 
section 231c(d) of this title
 shall be subject to a deduction of $1 for each $2 of compensation received by such spouse from compensated service rendered in such month to the last person, or persons, by whom such spouse was employed before the date on which the annuity of such spouse under subsection (c)(1) of this section began to accrue.






(B)
 Any deductions imposed by this subdivision for any month shall not exceed 50 percent of the annuity amount for such month to which such deductions apply.






(g)
 Employment compensation of survivors; deductions
(1)
 No annuity shall be paid to a survivor under subsection (d) of this section with respect to any month in which such survivor renders service for compensation as an employee of an employer. Survivors receiving annuities under subsection (d) of this section shall report to the Board immediately all such service for compensation.




(2)
 Deductions, in amounts and at such time or times as the Board shall determine, shall be made from any payments to which a survivor is entitled under subsection (d) of this section until the total of such deductions equals such survivor’s annuity under that subsection for any month, if for such month such survivor would be charged with excess earnings under section 203(f) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 403(f)
] or, having engaged in any activity outside the United States, would be charged under such section 203(f) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 403(f)
] with any excess earnings derived from such activity if it had been an activity within the United States. For purposes of this subdivision the Board shall have the authority to take such actions and to make such determinations and such suspensions of payment of benefits in the manner and to the extent that the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be authorized to take or to make under section 203(h)(3) of the Social Security Act if the survivors were receiving the annuities to which this subdivision applies under section 202 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402
]: 
Provided, however
, That in determining a survivor’s excess earnings for a year for the purposes of this subdivision there shall not be included his income from employment or self-employment during months beginning with the month with respect to which he ceases to be qualified for an annuity. Survivors receiving annuities under subsection (d) of this section shall report to the Board the receipt of excess earnings described in this subdivision.

(2)
 The supplemental annuity provided an individual by subsection (b) of this section shall, with respect to any month, be reduced by the amount of the supplemental pension, attributable to the employer’s contribution, that such individual is entitled to receive for that month under any other supplemental pension plan: 
Provided, however
, That the maximum of such reduction shall be equal to the amount of the supplemental annuity less any amount by which the supplemental pension is reduced by reason of the supplemental annuity.




(3)
 If a spouse or divorced wife entitled to an annuity under subsection (c) of this section or a survivor entitled to an annuity under subsection (d) of this section for any month is also entitled to annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section for such month, the annuity under subsection (c) or (d) of this section shall be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to the annuity under subsection (a)(1) of this section: 
Provided, however
, That the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply if either the spouse or survivor or the individual upon whose earnings record the spouse’s or survivor’s annuity under subsection (c) or (d) of this section is based rendered service as an employee to an employer, or as an employee representative, prior to 
January 1, 1975
.




(4)
 If an annuitant is entitled to more than one annuity under subsections (c) and (d) of this section for a month, such annuitant shall be entitled to only the larger of such annuities for such month, except that, if such annuitant so elects, he shall instead be entitled to only the smaller of such annuities for such month.




(i)
 Limitation; service accrued after 1995
An individual entitled to an annuity under this section who has completed five years of service, all of which accrues after 1995, but who has not completed ten years of service, and the spouse, divorced spouse, and survivors of such individual, shall not be entitled to an annuity amount provided under section 231b(a), section 231c(a), or 
section 231c(f) of this title
 unless the individual, or the individual’s spouse, divorced spouse, or survivors, would be entitled to a benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.] on the basis of the individual’s employment record under both this subchapter and title II of the Social Security Act.




 Computation of annuities
(a)
 Amount
(1)
 The annuity of an individual under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 shall be in an amount equal to the amount (before any reduction on account of age and before any deductions on account of work) of the old-age insurance benefit or disability insurance benefit to which such individual would have been entitled under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] if all of his or her service as an employee after 
December 31, 1936
, had been included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act.




(2)
 For purposes of this subsection, individuals entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1)(ii) of this title
 shall, except for the purposes of recomputations in accordance with section 215(f) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 415(f)
], be deemed to have attained retirement age (as defined by section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416
(
l
)]). For purposes of this subsection, individuals entitled to an annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 shall be deemed to be entitled to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 423
].




(3)
 If an individual entitled to an annuity under section 231a(a)(1)(i) or (iii) of this title on the basis of less than ten years of service is entitled to a benefit under section 202(a), section 202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402(a)
, (b), (c)] which began to accrue before the annuity under section 231a(a)(1)(i) or (iii) of this title, the annuity amount provided such individual under this subsection, shall be computed as though the annuity under this subchapter began to accrue on the later of (A) the date on which the benefit under section 202(a), section 202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social Security Act began, or (B) the date on which the individual first met the conditions for entitlement to an age reduced annuity under this subchapter other than the conditions set forth in sections 231a(e)(1) and 231a(e)(2) of this title and the requirement that an application be filed.




(b)
 Increased annuities under subsection (a)
(1)
 The amount of the annuity of an individual provided under subsection (a) of this section shall be increased by an amount equal to seven-tenths of 1 per centum of the product which is obtained by multiplying such individual’s “years of service” by such individual’s “average monthly compensation” as determined under this subsection. The annuity amount payable to the individual under this subsection shall be reduced by 25 per centum of the annuity amount computed for such individual under subsection (h)(1) or (h)(2), and subsection (h)(5), of this section without regard to 
section 231f(c)(1) of this title
. An individual’s “average monthly compensation” for purposes of this subsection shall be the quotient obtained by dividing by 60 such individual’s total compensation for the 60 months, consecutive or otherwise, during which such individual received that individual’s highest monthly compensation, except that no part of any month’s compensation in excess of the maximum amount creditable for any individual for such month under subsection (j) of this section shall be recognized. In determining the months of compensation to be used for purposes of this subsection, the total compensation reported for the individual under 
section 231h of this title
 or credited to such individual under subsection (j) of this section for a year divided by the number of months of service credited to such individual under subsection (i) of this section with respect to such year shall be considered the monthly compensation of the individual for each month of service in any year for which records of the Board do not show the amount of compensation paid to the individual on a monthly basis. If the “average monthly compensation” computed under this subsection is not a multiple of $1, it shall be rounded to the next lower multiple of $1.




(2)
 For purposes of subdivision (1) of this subsection, in determining “average monthly compensation” for an individual who has not engaged in employment for an employer in the 60-month period preceding the month in which such individual’s annuity began to accrue, and whose major employment during such 60-month period was for a United States department or agency named in section 231(
o
) of this title, the amount of compensation used with respect to each month used in making such determination shall be the product of—
(i)
 the compensation credited to such individual for such month under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and




(ii)
 the quotient obtained by dividing—
(I)
 the average of total wages (as de­termined under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 415(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I)
]) for the second calendar year preceding the earliest of the year of the individual’s death or the year in which an annuity begins to accrue to such individual (disregarding an annuity based on disability which is terminated because such individual has recovered from such disability if such individual engages in any regular employment after such termination); by




(II)
 the average of total wages (as de­termined under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 415(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II)
]) for the calendar year during which such month occurred, unless such month occurred prior to calendar year 1951, in which case, the average of total wages so determined for 1951.







In no event shall “average monthly compensation” determined for an individual under this subdivision exceed the maximum “average monthly compensation” which can be determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection for any person retiring January 1 of the year in which such individual’s annuity began to accrue.

 Supplemental annuities
The supplemental annuity of an individual under

 Reductions in annuities
(1)
 If, in the case of an individual whose annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 began to accrue prior to 
January 1, 1983
, the annuity (before any reduction due to such individual’s entitlement to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] and disregarding any amount provided by subsection (h) of this section) plus the supplemental annuity to which such individual is entitled for any month under this subchapter, together with the annuity, if any, of the spouse of such individual (before any reduction due to such spouse’s entitlement to a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit under the Social Security Act and disregarding any amount provided by 
section 231c(e) of this title
), before any reductions under the provisions of 
section 231a(f) of this title
 is less than the total amount which would have been payable to such individual and his spouse for such month, on the basis of the individual’s compensation and years of service, under the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 as in effect on 
December 31, 1974

 et seq.], disregarding, for purposes of the computations under such Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 compensation for any month after 
December 31, 1974
, in excess of one-twelfth of the maximum annual taxable “wages” (as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [
26 U.S.C. 3121
]) for the calendar year 1974, the annuity of such individual and the annuity of such spouse, if any, shall be increased proportionately so as to equal such total amount. For the purpose of computing amounts under this subdivision, the Board shall have the authority to approximate the effect of the reductions prescribed by sections 3(a)(2) and 3(a)(3) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228c(a)(2)
, (a)(3)]. For purposes of computing amounts payable under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, any increases in the amounts determined under the first proviso of section 3(e) of such Act which would have become effective after 
December 31, 1974
, shall be disregarded.




(2)
 If for any month in which an annuity accrues and is payable under this subchapter the annuity to which an individual is entitled under this subchapter (or would have been entitled except for a reduction pursuant to a joint and survivor election), together with the annuity, if any, of the spouse and divorced wife of such individual, is less than the total amount, or the additional amount, which would have been payable to all persons for such month under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] if such individual’s service as an employee after 
December 31, 1936
, were included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act, the annuities of the individual and spouse shall be increased proportionately to such total amount, or such additional amount: 
Provided, however
, That if an annuity accrues to an individual or a spouse for a part of a month, the amount payable for such part of a month under this subdivision shall be one-thirtieth of the amount payable under this subdivision for an entire month, multiplied by the number of days in such part of a month. For purposes of this subdivision, (i) persons not entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a of this title
 shall not be included in the computation under this subdivision except a spouse who could qualify for an annuity under 
section 231a(c) of this title
 if the individual from whom the spouse’s annuity under this subchapter would derive had attained age 60 or 62, as the case may be, and such individual’s children who meet the definition as such contained in section 216(e) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416(e)
]; (ii) after an annuity has been certified for payment and this subdivision was inapplicable after allowing for any waiting period under section 223(c)(2) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 423(c)(2)
], and after having considered the inclusion of all persons who were then eligible for inclusion in the computation under this subdivision, or was then applicable but later became inapplicable, any recertification in such annuity under this subdivision shall not take into account persons not entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a of this title
 except a spouse who could qualify for an annuity under 
section 231a(c) of this title
 when she attains age 60 or 62, as the case may be, if the individual from whom the spouse’s annuity would derive had attained age 60 or 62, as the case may be, and who was married to such individual at the time he applied for his annuity; and (iii) in computing the amount to be paid under this subdivision the only benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.] which shall be considered shall be those to which the persons included in the computation are entitled.




(g)
 Increased annuities under subsection (b)
(1)
 Effective with the date of any increase after 
January 31, 1984
, in monthly insurance benefits under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] which occurs, or which would have occurred had there not been a general benefit increase under that Act, pursuant to the automatic cost-of-living provisions of section 215(i) of that Act [
42 U.S.C. 415(i)
], that portion of the annuity of an individual which is computed under subsection (b) of this section shall, if such individual’s annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 began to accrue on or before the effective date of a particular increase under this subdivision, be increased by 32.5 per centum of the percentage increase in the index which is used, or which would have been used had there not been a general benefit increase under the Social Security Act, in increasing benefits under the Social Security Act pursuant to the automatic cost-of-living provisions of section 215(i) of that Act. Any increase under this subsection shall not be deferred and shall be reflected in all payments made to annuitants after such increase under this subsection becomes effective.




(2)
 The first and, if necessary, the following time or times after 
January 1, 1983
, that monthly insurance benefits under section 202 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402
] are increased, that portion of the annuity of an individual which is computed under subsection (b) of this section as increased under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall, if such individual’s annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 began to accrue in or before the year in which such first increase under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] became effective, be reduced by the dollar amount by which that portion of the annuity provided such individual under subsection (a) of this section was increased, after any reduction under subsection (m) of this section, as a result of such increase or increases under the Social Security Act until the total dollar amount of such reduction or reductions equals 5 per centum of the annuity amount provided such individual under subsection (a) of this section, as reduced under subsection (m) of this section, prior to such first increase. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.

, or at the time his annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 began to accrue, or (iii) completed twenty-five years of service prior to 
January 1, 1975
, and (B) will have completed ten years of service prior to 
January 1, 1975
, and is the wife, husband, widow, or widower of a person who will have been permanently insured under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] on 
December 31, 1974
, shall be increased by an amount equal to the smaller of (C) the wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit to which such individual would have been entitled, upon attaining age 65 (or, if later, for January 1975), under the provisions of the Social Security Act as in effect on

(4)
 The amount of the annuity provided under subsections (a) and (b) of this section of an individual who (A) will not have met the conditions set forth in subclause (i), (ii), or (iii) of clause (A) of subdivision (3) of this subsection, but (B) will have completed ten years of service prior to

42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] as of December 31 of the calendar year prior to 1975 in which such individual last rendered service as an employee to an employer, or as an employee representative, shall be increased by an amount equal to the smaller of (C) the wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit to which such individual would have been entitled, upon attaining age 65 (or, if later, for January 1975), under the provisions of the Social Security Act as in effect on

, if such service as an employee had been included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act.




(5)
 The amount computed under subdivision (1), (2), (3), or (4) of this subsection shall be increased by the same percentage, or percentages, as benefits under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] are increased, or would have been increased had there been no general benefit increases under the Social Security Act, pursuant to the automatic cost-of-living provisions of section 215(i) of that Act [
42 U.S.C. 415(i)
] during the period from 
January 1, 1975
, to the earlier of the date on which the individual’s annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 began to accrue or 
January 1, 1982
.




(6)
 No amount shall be payable to an individual under subdivision (3) or (4) of this subsection unless the entitlement of such individual to such amount had been determined prior to 
August 13, 1981
.




(i)
 Years of service
(1)
 The “years of service” of an individual shall include all his service subsequent to 
December 31, 1936
.




(2)
 The “years of service” of an individual shall also include his voluntary or involuntary military service, within or without the United States, during any war service period: 
Provided, however
, That such military service shall be included only if, prior to the beginning of his military service and in the same calendar year in which such military service began, or in the next preceding calendar year, the individual rendered service for compensation to an employer or to a person service to which is otherwise creditable under this subchapter, or lost time as an employee for which he received remuneration, or was serving as an employee representative: 
Provided further
, That such military service shall be included only subject to and in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (1) and (3) of this subsection in the same manner as though military service were service rendered as an employee: 
And provided further
, That such military service rendered after December 1956 shall not be included with respect to any month if (A) any benefits are payable for that month under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income, (B) such military service was included in the computation of such benefits, and (C) the inclusion of such military service in the computation of such benefits resulted (for that month) in benefits not otherwise payable or in an increase in the benefits otherwise payable: 
And provided further
, That an individual who entered military service prior to a war service period shall not be regarded as having been in military service in a war service period with respect to any part of the period for which he entered such military service.




(3)
 The “years of service” of an individual who was an employee on 
August 29, 1935
, shall, if the total number of his “years of service” as determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) is less than thirty, also include his service prior to 
January 1, 1937
, but not so as to make his total years of service exceed thirty: 
Provided, however
, That with respect to any such individual who rendered service to any employer subsequent to 
December 31, 1936
, and who on 
August 29, 1935
, was not an employee of an employer conducting the principal part of its business in the United States, no greater proportion of his service rendered prior to 
January 1, 1937
, shall be included in his “years of service” than the proportion which his total compensation (without regard to any limitation on the amount of compensation otherwise provided in this subchapter) for service subsequent to 
December 31, 1936
, rendered anywhere to an employer conducting the principal part of its business in the United States or rendered in the United States to any other employer bears to his total compensation (without regard to any limitation on the amount of compensation otherwise provided in this subchapter) for service rendered anywhere to an employer subsequent to 
December 31, 1936
. Where the “years of service” include only part of the service prior to 
January 1, 1937
, the part included shall be taken in reverse order beginning with the last calendar month of such service.




(4)
 Where for any calendar year after 1984 an individual has performed service for compensation in less than twelve months of the calendar year but has received compensation in excess of an amount determined by multiplying the number of months in the year in which such individual performed service for compensation by an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable “wages” as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [
26 U.S.C. 3121
], the individual shall be deemed to have rendered service for compensation in that number of months in the calendar year, but not to exceed twelve, which is equal to the quotient of the amount of such individual’s compensation for the calendar year divided by an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable “wages” as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with any remainder produced by this computation increasing the quotient by one, but an individual shall not be deemed under this subdivision to have rendered service for compensation in any month in which such individual was neither in an employment relation to one or more employers nor an employee representative.




(j)
 Average monthly compensation
The “average monthly compensation” shall be computed in the manner specified in subsection (b) of this section, except (1) that with respect to service prior to 
January 1, 1937
, the monthly compensation shall be the average compensation paid to an employee with respect to calendar months included in his years of service in the years 1924–1931, and (2) the amount of compensation paid or attributable as paid to him with respect to each month of service before September 1941 as a station employee whose duties consisted of or included the carrying of passengers’ hand baggage and otherwise assisting passengers at passenger stations and whose remuneration for service to the employer was, in whole or in substantial part, in the forms of tips, shall be the monthly average of the compensation paid to him as a station employee in his months of service in the period September 1940 through August 1941: 
Provided, however
, That where service in the period 1924 through 1931 in the one case, or in the period September 1940 through August 1941 in the other case, is, in the judgment of the Board, insufficient to constitute a fair and equitable basis for determing 
1
1
 So in original. Probably should be “determining”.
 the amount of compensation paid or attributable as paid to him in each month of service before 1937, or September 1941, respectively, the Board shall determine the amount of such compensation for each such month in such manner as in its judgment shall be fair and equitable. In computing the monthly compensation, no part of any month’s compensation in excess of $300 for any month before 
July 1, 1954
, or in excess of $350 for any month after 
June 30, 1954
, and before 
June 1, 1959
, or in excess of $400 for any month after 
May 31, 1959
, and before 
November 1, 1963
, or in excess of $450 for any month after 
October 31, 1963
, and before 
October 1, 1965
, or in excess of (i) $450, or (ii) an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable “wages” as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [
26 U.S.C. 3121
], whichever is greater, for any month after 
September 30, 1965
, shall be recognized. If for any calendar year after 1984 an employee has received compensation of less than one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable “wages” as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in one or more months of the calendar year, the total compensation paid such employee in the calendar year (without regard to the limitation on the amount of compensation provided in the preceding sentence) shall be deemed to have been paid in equal proportions with respect to all months in the year in which the employee will have been in the service of one or more employers for compensation or will have performed service for compensation as an employee representative, but this sentence shall not operate to increase the employee’s compensation for any month above an amount equal to one-twelfth of the current maximum annual taxable “wages” as defined in section 3121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the employee earned compensation in service after 
June 30, 1937
, and after the last day of the calendar year in which he attained age sixty-five, such compensation and service shall be disregarded in computing the average monthly compensation if the result of taking such compensation into account in such computation would be to diminish his annuity. Where an employee claims credit for months of service rendered within two years prior to his retirement from the service of an employer, with respect to which the employer’s return pursuant to 
section 231h of this title
 has not been entered on the records of the Board before the employee’s annuity could otherwise be certified for payment, the Board may, in its discretion (subject to subsequent adjustment at the request of the employee) include such months in the computation of the annuity without further verification and may consider the compensation for such months to be the average of the compensation for months in the last period for which the employer has filed a return of the compensation of such employee and such return has been entered on the records of the Board.




(k)
 Employee representatives
The annuity of an individual who shall have been an employee representative shall be determined in the same manner and with the same effect as if the employee organization by which he shall have been employed were an employer.




(l)
 Reductions for increased annuities
(1)
 Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, if an annuity awarded under 
section 231a(a)(1)(iii) of this title
 or under 
section 231a(c)(2) of this title
 is increased or decreased either by a change in the law or by a recomputation, the reduction on account of age in the amount of such increase or decrease shall be computed as though such increased or decreased annuity amount had been in effect for and after the month in which the annuitant first became entitled to such annuity under section 231a(a)(1)(iii) or 
section 231a(c)(2) of this title
.




(2)
 The reduction required under section 231a(a)(1)(iii) or 
section 231a(c)(2) of this title
 may be applied separately to each of the annuity amounts computed under subsections (a), (b), and (h) of this section and subsections (a), (b), and (e) of 
section 231c of this title
. For this purpose, in any case in which an annuity amount was computed for an individual under the provisions of this subchapter or of 
Public Law 93–445
 prior to 
October 1, 1981
, an annuity amount computed under subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) and (h) of this section, subsection (a), (b), or (e) of 
section 231c of this title
, and section 204 or 
section 206 of Public Law 93–445
 shall be reduced by its proportionate share of the reduction on account of age. For purposes of the preceding sentence, annuity amounts computed for an individual under subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section prior to October 1981 shall be considered as one annuity amount.




(m)
 Reductions due to monthly social security payments
The annuity of any individual under subsection (a) of this section for any month shall, after any reduction pursuant to paragraph (iii) of 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
, be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of any monthly benefit (before any deductions on account of work) payable to that individual for that month under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.].




 Computation of spouse and survivor annuities
(a)
 Amount of spouses’ annuities; age
(1)
 The annuity of a spouse or divorced wife of an individual under 
section 231a(c) of this title
 shall be in an amount equal to the amount (before any reduction on account of age and before any deductions on account of work) of the wife’s insurance benefit or the husband’s insurance benefit to which such spouse or divorced wife would have been entitled under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] if such individual’s service as an employee after 
December 31, 1936
, had been included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act.




(2)
 For purposes of this subsection, a spouse entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(B) of this title
 shall be deemed to have attained retirement age (as defined in section 216(
l
) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416
(
l
)]

 So in original. Probably should be followed by a closing parenthesis.
.




(3)
 If a spouse entitled to an annuity under section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(A), section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(C), or 
section 231a(c)(2) of this title
 or a divorced spouse entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(c)(4) of this title
 on the basis of the employment record of an employee who will have completed less than 10 years of service is entitled to a benefit under section 202(a), section 202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402(a)
, (b), (c)] which began to accrue before the annuity under section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(A), section 231a(c)(1)(ii)(C), section 231a(c)(2), or 
section 231a(c)(4) of this title
, the annuity amount provided under this subsection shall be computed as though the annuity under this subchapter began to accrue on the later of (A) the date on which the benefit under section 202(a), section 202(b), or section 202(c) of the Social Security Act began or (B) the first date on which the annuitant met the conditions for entitlement to an age reduced annuity under this subchapter other than the conditions set forth in sections 231a(e)(1) and 231a(e)(2) of this title and the requirement that an application be filed.




(b)
 Increases in spouses’ annuities in accordance with section 231b(b), (c), (d) of this title
The amount of the annuity of a spouse of an individual provided under subsection (a) of this section shall be increased by an amount equal to 45 per centum of that portion of the individual’s annuity as is computed under subsection (b) of 
section 231b of this title
: 
Provided, however
, That if the spouse is entitled to an annuity amount provided by subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section, the amount of such spouse’s annuity provided by the preceding provisions of this subsection shall be reduced by the amount by which the amount computed in accordance with the provisions of clause (C) of subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section was increased by the Social Security Amendments of 1965, 1967, and 1969, disregarding (A) the amount of any such increase resulting from the Social Security Amendments of 1967 equal to, or less than, the excess of $5 over 5.8 per centum of the lesser of (i) the amount computed under clause (C) of subsection (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section before any increases derived from legislation enacted after the Social Security Amendments of 1967 or (ii) the amount of the spouse’s annuity to which such spouse would have been entitled under section 2(e) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228b(e)
], without regard to section 3(a)(2) of that Act [
45 U.S.C. 228c(a)(2)

(2)
 For purposes of this subsection—
(i)
 a widow or widower or a parent who is entitled to an annuity based on age under 
section 231a(d)(1) of this title

 Increases in survivor’s annuities in accordance with subsection (f)
(1)
 The amount of the annuity provided under subsection (f)(1) of this section (other than the last sentence thereof) for a survivor of a deceased individual shall be increased by an amount equal to the appropriate one of the following percentages of that portion of the annuity computed under 
section 231b(b) of this title
, before any reduction on account of age and without regard to any reduction under 
section 231b(g)(2) of this title
, to which such deceased individual would have been entitled for the month such survivor’s annuity under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 began to accrue if such individual were living (deeming for this purpose that if such individual died before becoming entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
, such individual became entitled to an annuity under subdivision (i) of such 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 in the month in which such individual died):
(i)
 In the case of a widow or widower, the increase shall be equal to 50 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity, but the amount of the annuity so determined shall be subject to reduction on account of age in the same manner as is applicable to the annuity amount determined for the widow or widower under subsection (f) of this section and shall be subject to increase as provided in subdivision (4) of this subsection.

section 231b(b) of this title
 as determined under subdivision (1) of this subsection for all survivors of a deceased employee is—
(i)
 less than an amount equal to 35 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity, the total increase shall, before any deductions under 
section 231a(g) of this title
, be increased proportionately until the total increase is equal to 35 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity; or




(ii)
 more than an amount equal to 80 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity, the total increase shall, before any deductions under 
section 231a(g) of this title
 and before any reduction on account of age, be reduced proportionately until the total increase is equal to 80 per centum of such portion of the deceased individual’s annuity.






(3)
 An annuity determined under this subsection for a month prior to the month in which application is filed, shall be reduced to any extent that may be necessary so that it will not render erroneous any annuity which, before the filing of such application, the Board has certified for payment for such prior month.




(4)
 If a widow or widower of a deceased employee is entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 and if either such widow or widower or such deceased employee will have completed 10 years of service prior to 
January 1, 1975
, the amount of the annuity of such widow or widower under subdivisions (1) through (3) of this subsection shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which (A) the widow’s or widower’s insurance annuity to which such widow or widower would have been entitled, upon attaining age 65, under section 5(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228e(a)
] as in effect on 
December 31, 1974

45 U.S.C. 228c(e)

42 U.S.C. 402
] are increased during the period from 
January 1, 1975
, to the later of the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 began to accrue or the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under 
section 231a(d)(1) of this title
 began to accrue, exceeds (B) the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower was entitled (after any reductions pursuant to subsection (i)(2) of this section but before any deductions on account of work) under the preceding provisions of this subsection, subsection (f) of this section, and the amount determined under subsection (h) of this section, before the proviso, as of the later of the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 began to accrue or the date on which such widow’s or widower’s annuity under 
section 231a(d)(1) of this title
 began to accrue. If a widow or widower of a deceased employee is not entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 or to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.], the amount of the annuity to which such widow or widower is entitled under this subsection shall not be less than an amount which would cause the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower is entitled (before any deductions on account of work) under this subsection and subsection (f)(1) of this section to equal the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower was entitled (or would have been entitled except for the provisions of sections 231a(e) and 231a(f) of this title) as a spouse under subsections (a), (b), and (e) of this section (after any reduction on account of age) in the month preceding the employee’s death. If a widow or widower of a deceased employee is entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 or to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act, the amount of the annuity to which such widow or widower is entitled under this subsection shall not be less than an amount which would cause (A) the total of the annuity amounts to which such widow or widower is entitled (after any reductions pursuant to section 202(k) or 202(q) of the Social Security Act or subsection (i)(2) of this section but before any deductions on account of work) under this subsection and subsection (f) of this section to equal (B)(i) the total of the annuity amounts, if any, to which such widow or widower was entitled (or would have been entitled except for the provisions of sections 231a(e) and 231a(f) of this title) as a spouse under subsections (a), (b), and (e) of this section (after any reduction on account of age) in the month preceding the employee’s death less (ii), if such widow or widower is entitled to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act but was not entitled to such a benefit in the month preceding the employee’s death, the amount by which the annuity amount payable under subsection (a) of this section to such widow or widower as a spouse in the month preceding the employee’s death would have been reduced by reason of section 202(k) or 202(q) of the Social Security Act if such widow or widower had been entitled to an old-age insurance benefit or a disability insurance benefit under the Social Security Act in the month preceding the employee’s death in an amount equal to the amount of such benefit at the time such benefit first began to accrue to such widow or widower.




(5)
 This subsection shall not apply to the annuity of a widow, surviving divorced wife, or surviving divorced mother who is entitled to such annuity on the basis of the provisions of 
section 231a(d)(1)(v) of this title
.




(6)
 That portion of the annuity of a survivor of an individual determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be increased whenever, and by the same percentage or percentages as, the annuity of the individual would have been increased pursuant to 
section 231b(g)(1) of this title
 if such individual were still living.




(7)
 The first and, if necessary, the following time or times after 
January 1, 1983
, that monthly insurance benefits under section 202 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402
] are increased, that portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection, or under this subsection as in effect before amendment by 
section 1119(g) of Public Law 97–35
, shall, if such survivor’s annuity under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 began to accrue before the effective date of such first increase under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.], be reduced by the dollar amount by which that portion of the annuity provided such survivor under subsection (f) of this section was increased, after any reduction under subsection (i) of this section, as a result of such increase or increases under the Social Security Act until the total dollar amount of such reduction or reductions equals 5 per centum of the annuity amount provided such survivor under subsection (f) of this section, as reduced under subsection (i) of this section, prior to such first increase. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.




(8)
 That portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection shall, if the annuity of such survivor is not subject to reduction under subdivision (7) of this subsection, be reduced by an amount equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual was reduced under 
section 231b(g)(2) of this title
 or would have been reduced under such 
section 231b(g)(2) of this title
 if such deceased individual had been living at the time such survivor’s annuity under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 began to accrue (deeming for this purpose, if such individual died before becoming entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
, that such individual became entitled to an annuity under paragraph (i) of such 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 in the month in which such individual died). In a case where the survivor of a deceased individual is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.], the reduction provided by the preceding sentence of this subdivision shall be equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual would have been reduced under 
section 231b(g)(2) of this title
 if the annuity of such deceased individual had not been subject to reduction under 
section 231b(m) of this title
. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.




(9)
 That portion of the annuity of a survivor of a deceased individual as is determined under this subsection as in effect before amendment by 
section 1119(g) of Public Law 97–35
 shall, if the annuity of such survivor is not subject to reduction under subdivision (7) of this subsection, be reduced by an amount equal to the dollar amount by which the annuity of the deceased individual was reduced under 
section 231b(g)(2) of this title
 or, if such survivor is not entitled to a monthly insurance benefit under the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.], would have been reduced under such 
section 231b(g)(2) of this title
 if the annuity of such deceased individual had not been subject to reduction under 
section 231b(m) of this title
. In no case shall the reduction by reason of this paragraph operate to reduce such portion to an amount less than $10.




(10)
(i)
 If for any month the unreduced annuity provided under this section for a widow or widower is less than the widow’s or widower’s initial minimum amount computed pursuant to paragraph (ii) of this subdivision, the unreduced annuity shall be increased to that initial minimum amount. For the purposes of this subdivision, the unreduced annuity is the annuity without regard to any deduction on account of work, without regard to any reduction for entitlement to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
, without regard to any reduction for entitlement to a benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401

42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.].




(2)
 If a spouse or divorced wife entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(c) of this title
 or a survivor entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 for any month is also entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 for such month, the annuity amount of such spouse or divorced wife determined under subsection (a) of this section or of such survivor under subsection (f) of this section shall, after any reduction pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, be reduced by the amount of the annuity of such spouse or divorced wife or such survivor determined under 
section 231b(a) of this title
.




(3)
 The annuity of any survivor under subsection (f) of this section shall be reduced, but not below zero, by the amount of any insurance benefit (before any deduction on account of work) payable to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.], unless in computing the amount under subsection (f) of this section a reduction was made for such insurance benefit pursuant to section 202(k) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402(k)
].

42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.].

(9)
 No annuity shall accrue with respect to the calendar month in which an annuitant dies. In cases where an individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter disappears, no annuity shall accrue to that individual with respect to any month until and unless such individual is shown, by evidence satisfactory to the Board, to have continued in life throughout such month, but—
(A)
 where an annuity would accrue for such month under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 to an individual who had a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of such individual’s disappearance, and under 
section 231a(c) of this title
 to such individual’s spouse, had such individual been shown to be alive during such month, such individual shall be deemed, for the purposes of benefits under 
section 231a(d) of this title
, to have died in the month in which such individual disappeared, and where an annuity would accrue for such month under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 to an individual who did not have a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of such individual’s disappearance, and under 
section 231a(c) of this title
 to such individual’s spouse, had such individual been shown to be alive during such month, such individual shall be deemed, for purposes of benefits payable under 
section 231a(c) of this title
, to be alive during such month unless the death of such individual has been established or the annuity of the spouse of such individual is otherwise terminated under subsection (c)(3) of this section, and




(B)
 if such individual is later determined to have been alive during any of such months, recovery of any benefits paid on the basis of such individual’s compensation under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 for the months in which such individual was not known to be alive, minus the total of the amounts that would have been paid as a spouse’s annuity during such months (treating the application for a widow’s or widower’s annuity as an application for spouse’s annuity), shall be made in accordance with section 231
l
 of this title.





For purposes of the payment of benefits under this subchapter, the death of an individual shall be presumed based on such individual’s unexplained absence of not less than seven years, except that whenever the death of an individual is so established, such individual shall be deemed to have died in the month in which such individual disappeared.




 Lump sum payments

 Eligible annuities; applications; reversion; determination of status of recipient

 Annuities under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 and supplemental annuities under 
section 231a(b) of this title
 which will have become due an individual but will not have been paid at the time of such individual’s death shall be payable to the person, if any, who is determined by the Board to be such individual’s widow or widower and to have been living with such individual at the time of such individual’s death and who will not have died before receiving payment of such annuities. If there be no such widow or widower, such annuities shall be payable to any person or persons, equitably entitled thereto, to the extent and in the proportions that he or they shall have paid the expenses of burial of such individual, and to the extent that he or they will not have been reimbursed under subsection (b) of this section for having paid such expenses. If there be no person or persons so entitled, or if the total of such annuities exceeds the amount payable under this subdivision to such person or persons, such total, or the remainder thereof, as the case may be, shall be paid to the children, grandchildren, parents, or brothers and sisters of the deceased individual in the same manner as if such annuities were a lump sum payable under subsection (c)(1) of this section.




(2)
 Annuities under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 which will have become due a survivor of an employee but will not have been paid at the time of such survivor’s death shall be payable to the person, if any, who is determined by the Board to be such employee’s widow or widower and to have been living with such employee at the time of the employee’s death and who will not have died before receiving payment of such annuities. If there be no such widow or widower, such annuities shall be payable to the children, grandchildren, parents, or brothers and sisters of the deceased employee in the same manner as if such unpaid annuities were a lump sum payable under subsection (c)(1) of this section.




(3)
 Annuities under 
section 231a(c) of this title
 which will have become due a spouse or divorced wife of an individual but which will not have been paid at the time of such spouse’s or divorced wife’s death shall be payable to the individual from whose employment such annuities derived and who will not have died before receiving payment of such annuities. If there be no such individual, such annuities shall be paid as provided in the last two sentences of subdivision (1) of this subsection as if such annuities were annuities due to an individual but unpaid at the time of such individual’s death.




(4)
 Applications for accrued and unpaid annuities provided for in the preceding subdivisions of this subsection shall be filed prior to the expiration of two years after the death of the person to whom such annuities were originally due.




(5)
 If there is no person to whom all or any part of the payments described in subdivision (1), (2), or (3) can be made, such payment or part thereof shall escheat to the credit of the Railroad Retirement Account.




(6)
 For the purposes of this subsection and subsection (c) of this section, a widow or widower of an individual shall be deemed to have been living with the individual at the time of the individual’s death if the applicable conditions set forth in section 216(h)(2) or (3) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416(h)(2)
 or (3)], as in effect before 1957, are fulfilled.




(7)
 In determining for purposes of this subsection and subsections (c) and (d) of this section whether an applicant is the widow, widower, child, or parent of an employee as claimed, the rules set forth in section 216(h) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416(h)
] shall be applied. In determining for purposes of this subsection and subsections (c) and (d) of this section whether an applicant is the grandchild, brother, or sister of an employee as claimed, the Board shall apply such law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of the State in which such employee was domiciled at the time of his death, or if such employee was not so domiciled in any State by the courts of the District of Columbia. Applicants who according to such law would have the same status relative to taking personal property as a grandchild, brother, or sister shall be deemed such.




(b)
 Payments in accordance with Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 and Social Security Act
(1)
 Upon the death of an individual who will have completed ten years of service prior to 
January 1, 1975
, and will have had a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of his death, a lump-sum payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 5(f)(1) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228e(f)(1)
] as in effect on 
December 31, 1974
, in an amount, if any, which would have been payable under such section on the basis of (A) the individual’s compensation after 
December 31, 1936
, and prior to 
January 1, 1975
, and (B) the individual’s wages (as defined in section 209 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 409
]) prior to 
January 1, 1975
. Any lump sum payable under this subdivision shall be in an amount computed as if the individual had died on 
January 1, 1975
. No lump sum shall be payable under this subdivision if the employee died leaving a surviving divorced wife who would on proper application therefore be entitled to receive an annuity under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 for the month in which the employee’s death occurred.




(2)
 Upon the death of an individual who will not have completed ten years of service prior to 
January 1, 1975
, but who (i) will have completed ten years of service (or five or more years of service, all of which accrues after 
December 31, 1995
) at the time of his death, (ii) will have had a current connection with the railroad industry at the time of his death, and (iii) will have died leaving no widow, surviving divorced wife, widower, child, or parent who would on proper application therefor be entitled to receive an annuity under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 for the month in which such death occurred, a lump-sum death payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of section 202(i) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 402(i)
] in an amount equal to the amount which would have been payable under such section 202(i) if such individual’s service as an employee after 
December 31, 1936
, were included in the term “employment” as defined in that Act. If a lump sum would be payable to a widow or widower under this subdivision except for the fact that a survivor will have been entitled to receive an annuity for the month in which the individual will have died, but within one year after the individual’s death there will not have accrued to survivors of the individual, by reason of his death, annuities which, after all deductions pursuant to section 231a(g) and 231a(h) of this title, are equal to such lump sum, a payment equal to the amount by which such lump sum exceeds such annuities so accrued after such deductions shall then nevertheless be made under this subdivision to the widow or widower to whom a lump sum would have been payable under this subdivision except for the fact that a monthly benefit under 
section 231a(d) of this title
 was payable for the month in which the individual died, if such widow or widower will not have died before receiving payment of such lump sum.




(c)
 Payments in the absence of further benefits
(1)
 Whenever it shall appear, with respect to the death of an employee, that no benefits, or no further benefits (other than benefits payable to a widow, widower, or parent under either this subchapter or the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] upon attaining the age of eligibility therefor at a future date) will be payable under this subchapter or under the Social Security Act, a lump sum in an amount computed under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be paid to such person or persons as the deceased employee may have designated by a writing filed with the Board prior to his or her death, or if there be no designation, to the following person (or, if more than one, in equal shares to the persons) whose relationship to the deceased employee will have been determined by the Board and who will not have died before receiving payment of the lump sum provided for in this subdivision—
(i)
 the widow or widower of the deceased employee who was living with such employee at the time of such employee’s death; or




(ii)
 if there be no such widow or widower, to any child or children of such employee; or




(iii)
 if there be no such widow, widower, or child, to any grandchild or grandchildren of such employee; or




(iv)
 if there be no such widow, widower, child, or grandchild, to any parent or parents of such employee; or




(v)
 if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild, or parent, to any brother or sister of such employee; or




(vi)
 if there be no such widow, widower, child, grandchild, parent, brother, or sister, to the estate of such employee:





Provided, however
, That if the employee is survived by a widow, widower, or parent who may upon attaining the age of eligibility be entitled to benefits under this subchapter or under the Social Security Act, such lump sum shall not be paid unless such widow, widower, or parent makes and files with the Board an irrevocable election, in such form as the Board may prescribe, to have such lump sum be paid in lieu of all benefits to which such widow, widower, or parent might otherwise become entitled under this subchapter on the basis of the deceased employee’s compensation and years of service or under the Social Security Act on the basis of the deceased employee’s wages from (A) employment with an employer as defined in 
section 231(a) of this title
 or (B) service as an employee representative as defined in 
section 231(c) of this title
. Any election made and filed by a widow, widower, or parent pursuant to this subdivision shall be legally effective according to its terms. After a lump sum with respect to the death of an employee is paid pursuant to an election filed with the Board under the provisions of this subsection, no further benefits shall be paid (other than to a survivor in the circumstances described in paragraph (3)) under this subchapter or the Social Security Act on the basis of such employee’s compensation and service under this subchapter, except that nothing in this subchapter or the Social Security Act shall operate to deprive a widow, widower, or parent making such election of any insurance benefit under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.] to which such individual would have been entitled if the employee had not rendered service as an employee under this subchapter.




(2)
 The lump sum provided under subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be in an amount equal to (A) the sum of 4 per centum of the deceased employee’s compensation paid after 
December 31, 1936
, and prior to 
January 1, 1947
, plus 7 per centum of such employee’s compensation paid after 
December 31, 1946
, and before 
January 1, 1959
, plus 7½ per centum of such employee’s compensation paid after 
December 31, 1958
, and before 
January 1, 1962
, plus 8 per centum of such employee’s compensation paid after 
December 31, 1961
, and before 
January 1, 1966
, plus an amount equal to the total of all employee taxes payable by such employee after 
December 31, 1965
, and before 
January 1, 1975
, under the provisions of section 3201 of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [
26 U.S.C. 3201
] (excluding, for this purpose, the amount of the employee tax attributable to that portion of the tax rate derived from section 3101(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [
26 U.S.C. 3101(b)
]), plus one-half of 1 per centum of the compensation on which such taxes were payable, deeming the compensation attributable to creditable military service after 
June 30, 1963
, and before 
January 1, 1975
, to be taxable compensation, and one-half of the taxes payable by an employee representative under section 3211 of the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [
26 U.S.C. 3211
] to be employee taxes under section 3201 of such Act, minus (B) the sum of all benefits paid to such employee, and to others deriving from such employee, during his or her life, or to others by reason of his or her death, under this subchapter, the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228a
 et seq.], or the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] (excluding, for this purpose, payments to providers of services under 
section 231f(d) of this title
 or section 21 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228s–2
], any supplemental annuity payments made to the employee under 
section 231a(b) of this title
 or section 3(j) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228c(j)
], any amounts by which that portion of the annuities provided the employee under 
section 231b(a) of this title
 or his spouse or divorced wife under 
section 231c(a) of this title
 were increased by reason of the employee’s wages and self-employment income derived from employment and self-employment under the Social Security Act, that portion of the annuities provided the employee under 
section 231b(h) of this title
 or his spouse under 
section 231c(e) of this title
, and so much of the benefits paid to the employee and to others deriving from him or her under the Social Security Act during his or her lifetime as would have been payable under that Act if such employee had not rendered service as an employee as defined in 
section 231(b) of this title
). In computing compensation for purposes of this subdivision there shall be excluded compensation in excess of $300 for any month before 
July 1, 1954
; compensation in excess of $350 for any month after 
June 30, 1954
, and before 
June 1, 1959

26 U.S.C. 3121
], whichever is greater, for any month after 
September 30, 1965
.




(3)
 Notwithstanding the last sentence of paragraph (1), benefits shall be paid to a survivor who—
(A)
 is a divorced wife; and




(B)
 through administrative error received benefits otherwise precluded by the making of a lump sum payment under this section to a widow;





if that divorced wife makes an election to repay to the Board the lump sum payment. The Board may withhold up to 10 percent of each benefit amount paid after 
October 21, 1998

 Additional lump sum payment in certain cases
(1)
 Every individual who will have completed ten years of service (or five or more years of service, all of which accrues after 
December 31, 1995

section 231b(i)(4) of this title
 if such individual had remained in an employment relation to one or more employers or had continued to be an employee representative and (B) the rate of tax, or rates of tax, imposed on the compensation described in clause (A) of this subdivision by section 3201(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [

Such recertification and any subsequent recertification shall be treated in the same manner and be subject to the same conditions as an original certification.




(8)
 Any department or agency of the United States maintaining records of military service, at the request of the Board, shall certify to the Board, with respect to any individual, the number of months of military service which such department or agency finds the individual to have had during any period or periods with respect to which the Board’s request is made, the date and manner of entry into such military service, and the conditions under which such service was continued.

(c)
 Sources of payments; adjustments
(1)
 Benefit payments determined by the Board to be payable under this subchapter shall be made by the disbursing agent under subsection (b)(4) of this section from money transferred to it from the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust or the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Account, as the case may be, except that payments of annuity amounts made under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of 
Public Law 93–445
 shall be made by the disbursing agent under subsection (b)(4) of this section from money transferred to it from the Dual Benefits Payments Account. In any fiscal year, the total amounts paid under such sections shall not exceed the total sums appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for that fiscal year. The Board shall prescribe regulations for allocation of annuity amounts which would without regard to such regulations be payable under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of 
Public Law 93–445
 so that the sums appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for a fiscal year so far as practicable, are expended in equal monthly installments throughout such fiscal year, and are distributed so that recipients are paid annuity amounts which bear the same ratio to the annuity amounts such recipients would have received but for such regulations as the ratio of the total sums appropriated to pay such annuity amounts bear to the total sums necessary to pay such annuity amounts without regard to such regulations. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the entitlement of an individual to an annuity amount under section 231b(h), 231c(e), or 231c(h) of this title or section 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), or 207(3) of 
Public Law 93–445
 for any month in which the amount payable to such individual is allocated under the regulations prescribed by the Board under this subsection shall not exceed the amount so allocated for that month to such individual.




(2)
 At the close of the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1975
, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall determine the amounts, if any, which if added to or subtracted from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would place each such Trust Fund in the same position in which it would have been if (A) service as an employee after 
December 31, 1936
, had been included in the term “employment” as defined in the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] and in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act [
26 U.S.C. 3101
 et seq.] and (B) this subchapter had not been enacted. Such determination with respect to each such Trust Fund shall be made no later than June 15 following the close of the fiscal year. If, pursuant to any such determination, any amount is to be added to any such Trust Fund, the Board shall, within ten days after the determination, certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to such Trust Fund. If, pursuant to any such determination, any amount is to be subtracted from any such Trust Fund, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, within ten days after the determination, certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from such Trust Fund to the Railroad Retirement Account. Any amounts so certified shall further include interest (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for the fiscal year under consideration) payable from the close of such fiscal year until the date of certification. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, or the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund or to any such Trust Fund from the Railroad Retirement Account, as the case may be, such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision and certified by the Board or the Secretary of Health and Human Services for transfer from any such Trust Fund or from the Railroad Retirement Account.




(3)
 For purposes of subdivision (2), for any fiscal year, the rate of interest to be used shall be equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of May 31 preceding the close of such fiscal year, borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate.




(4)
 After the end of each month beginning with the month of October 1983, the Board shall determine the net amount, if any, which if added to or subtracted from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would, with respect to such month, place those Trust Funds, taken as a whole, in the same position in which they would have been if (A) service as an employee after 
December 31, 1936
, had been included in the term “employment” as defined in the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] and in the Federal Insurance Contributions Act [
26 U.S.C. 3101
 et seq.], and (B) this subchapter had not been enacted. If for any month the net amount so determined would be subtracted from those Trust Funds, the Board shall, within ten days after the end of such month, report such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the general fund to the Railroad Retirement Account. Any amount so reported shall further include interest (at an annual rate equal to the rate of interest borne by a special obligation issued to the Railroad Retirement Account in the month in which the transfer is made to the Account) payable from the close of the month for which the transfer is made until the date of transfer. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the general fund such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision and reported by the Board for transfer. For such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued after 
August 12, 1983
, under 
section 3102 of title 31
, and the purpose for which securities may be issued under 
section 3102 of title 31
 are extended to include such purpose. Each such transfer shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury within five days after a report of the amount to be transferred is received. Not later than December 31 following the close of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 1984
, the Board shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the total of all amounts transferred pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision for months in such fiscal year. Within ten days after a transfer, or transfers, pursuant to subdivision (2) for a particular fiscal year, the Board shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund an amount equal to (A) the total of all amounts, exclusive of interest, transferred to such Account pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision for months in such fiscal year, plus (B) interest (at the rate determined in subdivision (3) for such fiscal year) payable with respect to each amount transferred for a month during such fiscal year from the close of the month for which the transfer of the amount was made until the date of retransfer of such amount. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to retransfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the general fund such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of the preceding sentence of this subdivision and reported by the Board for retransfer.

42 U.S.C. 426
], and parts A and E of title XVIII [
42 U.S.C. 1395c
 et seq., 1395x et seq.], of the Social Security Act as the Secretary of Health and Human Services has under such section and such parts with respect to individuals to whom such sections and such parts apply. For purposes of 
section 231g of this title
, a determination with respect to the rights of an individual under this subsection shall, except in the case of a provider of services, be considered to be a decision with respect to an annuity.




(2)
 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, every person who—
(i)
 has attained age 65 and (A) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter or (B) would be entitled to such an annuity had he ceased compensated service and, in the case of a spouse or divorced wife, had such spouse’s husband or wife ceased compensated service or (C) bears a relationship to an employee which, by reason of 
section 231b(f)(2) of this title
, has been, or would be, taken into account in calculating the amount of the annuity of such employee; or




(ii)
 has not attained age 65 and (A) has been entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a of this title
, or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228a
 et seq.] and 
section 231a of this title
, or could have been includible in the computation of an annuity under 
section 231b(f)(2) of this title
, for not less than 24 months and (B) could have been entitled for 24 calendar months, and could currently be entitled, to monthly insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act [

shall be certified to the Secretary of Health and Human Services as a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary under section 226 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 426
].




(3)
 If an individual entitled to an annuity under paragraph (iv) or (v) of 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
 would have been insured for disability insurance benefits as determined under section 223(c)(1) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 423(c)(1)
] at the time such annuity began, he shall be deemed, solely for purposes of paragraph (ii) of subdivision (2), to be entitled to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social Security Act for each month, and beginning with the first month, in which he would meet the requirements for entitlement to such a benefit, other than the requirement of being insured for disability insurance benefits, if service as an employee after 
December 31, 1936
, had been included in the term “employment” as defined in the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 301
 et seq.] and if an application for disability benefits had been filed.




(4)
 The rights of individuals described in subdivision (2) of this subsection to have payment made on their behalf for the services referred to in subdivision (1) but provided in Canada shall be the same as those of individuals to whom section 226 [
42 U.S.C. 426
] and part A of title XVIII [
42 U.S.C. 1395c
 et seq.] of the Social Security Act apply, and this subdivision shall be administered by the Board as if the provisions of section 226 and part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act were applicable, as if references to the Secretary of Health and Human Services were to the Board, as if references to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund were to the Railroad Retirement Account, as if references to the United States or a State included Canada or a subdivision thereof, and as if the provisions of sections 1862(a)(4), 1863, 1864, 1868, 1869, 1874(b), and 1875 [
42 U.S.C. 1395y(a)(4)
, 1395z, 1395aa, 1395ee, 1395ff, 1395kk(b), 1395
ll

The payments for services herein provided for in Canada shall be made from the Railroad Retirement Account (in accordance with, and subject to, the conditions applicable under subsection (b) of this section, in making payment of other benefits) to the hospital, extended care facility, or home health agency providing such services in Canada to individuals to whom subdivision (2) of this subsection applies, but only to the extent that the amount of payments for services otherwise hereunder provided for an individual exceeds the amount payable for like services provided pursuant to the law in effect in the place in Canada where such services are furnished. For the purposes of 
section 231i of this title
, any overpayment under this subdivision shall be treated as if it were an overpayment of an annuity.




(5)
 The Board and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish each other with such information, records, and documents as may be considered necessary to the administration of this subsection or section 226 [
42 U.S.C. 426
], and part A of title XVIII [

Whenever the Board submits or transmits any budget estimate, budget request, supplemental budget estimate, or other budget information, legislative recommendation, prepared testimony for congressional hearings, or comment on legislation to the President or to the Office of Management and Budget, it shall concurrently transmit a copy thereof to the Congress. No officer or agency of the United States shall have any authority to require the Board to submit its budget requests or estimates, legislative recommendations, prepared testimony for congressional hearings, or comments on legislation to any officer or agency of the United States for approval, comments, or review, prior to the submission of such recommendations, testimony, or comments to the Congress.




 Annual actuarial report
 Court jurisdiction
Decisions of the Board determining the rights or liabilities of any person under this subchapter shall be subject to judicial review in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, and all provisions of law shall apply in the same manner as though the decision were a determination of corresponding rights or liabilities under the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [
 Returns of compensation; conclusiveness
Employers shall file with the Board, in such manner and form and at such times as the Board by rules and regulations may prescribe, returns of compensation of employees, and, if the Board shall so require, shall furnish employees with statements of their compensation as reported to the Board. The Board’s record of the compensation so returned shall be conclusive as to the amount of compensation paid to an employee during each period covered by the return, and the fact that the Board’s records show that no return was made of the compensation claimed to have been paid to an employee during a particular period shall be taken as conclusive that no compensation was paid to such employee during that period, unless the error in the amount of compensation returned in the one case, or the failure to make return of the compensation in the other case, is called to the attention of the Board within four years after the day on which return of the compensation was required to be made.
 Erroneous payments
(a)
 Recovery
If the Board finds that at any time more than the correct amount of annuities or other benefits has been paid to any individual under this subchapter, or payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto, recovery by adjustment in subsequent payments to which such individual, or any other individual on the basis of the same compensation, wages, or self-employment income, is entitled under this subchapter, or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [
45 U.S.C. 351
 et seq.] may, except as otherwise provided in this section, be made under regulations prescribed by the Board. If the individual to whom more than the correct amount has been paid dies before recovery is completed, recovery may be made by setoff or adjustments, under regulations prescribed by the Board, in subsequent payments due, under this subchapter, or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, to the estate of such individual or to any person on the basis of the compensation, wages, or self-employment income of such individual. The Board shall have the authority to recover from any payment which would be made to an individual by the Board under 
section 231f(b)(2) of this title
 the amount of annuity payments made to such individual which are erroneous because of such individual’s entitlement to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.].




(b)
 Adjustments
Adjustments under this section may be made either by deductions from subsequent payments or, with respect to payments which are to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes, by subtracting the total amount of annuities or other benefits paid in excess of the proper amount from the actuarial value, as determined by the Board, of such payments to be made during a lifetime or lifetimes and recertifying such payments on the basis of the reduced actuarial value. In the latter case, recovery shall be deemed to have been completed upon such recertification.




(c)
 Decision not to recover
There shall be no recovery in any case in which more than the correct amount of annuities or other benefits has been paid under this subchapter to an individual or payment has been made to an individual not entitled thereto who, in the judgment of the Board, is without fault when, in the judgment of the Board, recovery would be contrary to the purpose of this subchapter or the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act [
45 U.S.C. 351
 et seq.] or would be against equity or good conscience.




(d)
 Liability of officers
No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any amount certified or paid by him in good faith to any person where the recovery of such amount is waived under subsection (c) of this section or has been begun but cannot be completed under subsection (a) of this section.




 Waiver of annuities
Any person awarded an annuity under this subchapter may decline to accept all or any part of such annuity by a waiver signed and filed with the Board. Such a waiver may be revoked in writing at any time, but no payment of the annuity waived shall be made covering the period during which such waiver was in effect. Such a waiver will have no effect on entitlement to, or the amount of, any other annuity or benefit.
 Incompetence
(a)
 Every individual receiving or claiming benefits, or to whom any right or privilege is extended, under this subchapter or any other Act of Congress now or hereafter administered, in whole or in part, by the Board shall be conclusively presumed to have been competent until the date on which the Board receives written notice, in a form and manner acceptable to the Board, that he is an incompetent, or a minor, for whom a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of his person or estate has been appointed: 
Provided, however
, That, regardless of the legal competency or incompetency of an individual entitled to a benefit administered by the Board, the Board may, if it finds the interest of such individual to be served thereby, recognize actions by, and conduct transactions with, and make payments to, such individual, or recognize actions by, and conduct transactions with, and make payments to, a relative or some other person for such individual’s use and benefit.


(b)
 Every guardian or other person legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or minor who is receiving or claiming benefits, or to whom any right or privilege is extended, under this subchapter or any other Act of Congress now or hereafter administered, in whole or in part, by the Board shall have power everywhere, in the manner and to the extent prescribed by the Board, but subject to the provisions of the preceding subsection, to take any action necessary or appropriate to perfect any right or exercise any privilege of the incompetent or minor and to conduct all transactions on his behalf under this subchapter or any other Act of Congress now or hereafter administered, in whole or in part, by the Board. Any payment made pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be a complete settlement and satisfaction of any claim, right, or interest in and to such payment.


 Penalties
(a)
 Any person who shall knowingly fail or refuse to make any report or furnish any information required by the Board in the administration of this subchapter, including the provisions of 
section 231f(b)(2) of this title
 or who shall knowingly make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statement or report when a statement or report is required to be made for the purpose of this subchapter, or who shall knowingly make or aid in making any false or fraudulent statement or claim for the purpose of causing an award or payment to be made, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.


(b)
 All fines and penalties imposed by a court pursuant to this subchapter shall be paid to the court and be remitted from time to time by order of the judge to the Treasury of the United States to be credited to the Railroad Retirement Account.


 Assignability; exemption from levy
(a)
 Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [
26 U.S.C. 1
 et seq.], notwithstanding any other law of the United States, or of any State, territory, or the District of Columbia, no annuity or supplemental annuity shall be assignable or be subject to any tax or to garnishment, attachment, or other legal process under any circumstances whatsoever, nor shall the payment thereof be anticipated 
1
1
 So in original. Probably should be followed by a period.


(b)
(1)
 This section shall not operate to exclude the amount of any supplemental annuity paid to an individual under 
section 231a(b) of this title
 from income taxable pursuant to the Federal income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [
26 U.S.C. 1
 et seq.].




(2)
 This section shall not operate to prohibit the characterization or treatment of that portion of an annuity under this subchapter which is not computed under section 231b(a), 231c(a), or 231c(f) of this title, or any portion of a supplemental annuity under this subchapter, as community property for the purposes of, or property subject to, distribution in accordance with a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation or the terms of any court-approved property settlement incident to any such court decree. The Board shall make payments of such portions in accordance with any such characterization or treatment or any such decree or settlement.




(3)
(A)
 Payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not require that the employee be entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
: Provided, however, That where an employee is not entitled to such an annuity, payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) may not begin before the month in which the following three conditions are satisfied:
(i)
 The employee has completed ten years of service in the railroad industry or, five years of service all of which accrues after 
December 31, 1995
.




(ii)
 The spouse or former spouse attains age 62.




(iii)
 The employee attains age 62 (or if deceased, would have attained age 62).






(B)
 Payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall terminate upon the death of the spouse or former spouse, unless the court document provides for termination at an earlier date. Notwithstanding the language in a court order, that portion of payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) which represents payments computed pursuant to 
section 231b(f)(2) of this title
 shall not be paid after the death of the employee.




(C)
 If the employee is not entitled to an annuity under 
section 231a(a)(1) of this title
, payments made pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection shall be computed as though the employee were entitled to an annuity.






 Railroad Retirement Account
(a)
 Maintenance of account; authorization of appropriations
The Railroad Retirement Account established by section 15(a) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228
o
(a)] shall continue to be maintained in the Treasury of the United States. There is hereby appropriated to such Account for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1975
, to provide for the payment of benefits to be made from such Account in accordance with the provisions of 
section 231f(c)(1) of this title
, and to provide for expenses necessary for the Board in the administration of all provisions of this subchapter, an amount equal to amounts covered into the Treasury (minus refunds) during each fiscal year under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act [
26 U.S.C. 3201
 et seq.].




(b)
 Authorization of appropriations; military service costs and administrative expenses
In addition to the amount appropriated in subsection (a) of this section, there is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account for each fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1975
, such amount as the Board determines to be necessary to meet (A) the additional costs, resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter, of benefits payable under 
section 231a of this title
, but only to the extent that such Account is not reimbursed for such costs under 
section 231f(c)(2) of this title
, (B) the additional administrative expenses resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter, and (C) any loss in interest to such Account resulting from the payment of additional benefits based on military service credited under this subchapter: 
Provided, however
, That, in determining the amount to be appropriated to the Railroad Retirement Account for any fiscal year pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, there shall not be considered any costs resulting from the crediting of military service under this subchapter for which appropriations to such Account have already been made pursuant to section 4(
l
) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228c–1
(
l
)]. Any determination as to loss in interest to the Railroad Retirement Account pursuant to clause (C) of the first sentence of this subsection shall take into account interest from the date each annuity based, in part, on military service began to accrue or was increased to the date or dates on which the amount appropriated is credited to the Account. The cost resulting from the payment of additional benefits under this subchapter based on military service determined pursuant to the preceding provisions of this subsection shall be adjusted by applying thereto the ratio of the total net level cost of all benefits under this subchapter to the portion of such net level cost remaining after the exclusion of administrative expenses and interest charges on the unfunded accrued liability as determined under the last completed actuarial valuation pursuant to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section. At the close of the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1975
, and each fiscal year thereafter, the Board shall, as promptly as practicable, determine the amount to be appropriated to the Account pursuant to the provisions of this subsection, and shall certify such amount to the Secretary of the Treasury for transfer from the general fund in the Treasury to the Railroad Retirement Account. When authorized by an appropriation Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to the Railroad Retirement Account from the general fund in the Treasury such amounts as, from time to time, may be determined by the Board pursuant to the provisions of this subsection and certified by the Board for transfer to such Account. In any determination made pursuant to 
section 231f(c)(2) of this title
, no further charges shall be made against the Trust Funds established by title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.] for military service rendered before 
January 1, 1957
, and with respect to which appropriations authorized by clause (2) of the first sentence of section 4(
l
) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 shall have been credited to the Railroad Retirement Account, but the additional benefit payments incurred by such Trust Funds by reason of such military service shall be taken in account in making any such determination.

(d)
 Dual Benefits Payments Account
(1)
 There is hereby created an account in the Treasury of the United States to be known as the Dual Benefits Payments Account. There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to such account for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 1982
, such sums as are necessary to pay during such fiscal year the amounts of annuities estimated by the Board to be paid under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of 
Public Law 93–445
. Not more than 30 days prior to each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 1982
, the Board may request the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the credit of the Dual Benefits Payments Account any amount not exceeding the amount that the Board estimates will be necessary to pay on the first day of the next succeeding month the annuity amounts under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of 
Public Law 93–445
, taking into account any reduction in such annuity amounts as determined under 
section 231f(c)(1) of this title
, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall make such transfer, but at no time shall the total amount of money outstanding to the Dual Benefits Payments Account from the Railroad Retirement Account exceed the amount necessary to pay the annuity amounts under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of 
Public Law 93–445
 for one month. Not more than 10 days after the funds appropriated to the Dual Benefits Payments Account for each such fiscal year are received into such Account, the Board shall request the Secretary of the Treasury to retransfer from the Dual Benefits Payments Account to the credit of the Railroad Retirement Account an amount equal to the amount transferred to the Dual Benefits Payments Account prior to or during such fiscal year under the preceding sentence, together with such additional amount determined by the Board to be equal to the loss of interest to the Railroad Retirement Account resulting from such transfer, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall make such retransfer. The Secretary of the Treasury shall from time to time transfer from the Dual Benefits Payments Account to the disbursing agent under 
section 231f(b)(4) of this title
 amounts necessary to pay benefits payable from that Account.

 The Secretary of the Treasury—
(i)
 shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the Board on 
January 1, 1984
, one-third of the special amount described in subdivision (3) of this subsection;




(ii)
 shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the Board on 
January 1, 1985
, one-third of the special amount described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, plus an amount equal to the interest that one-third would have earned had it been in the Railroad Retirement Account since 
January 1, 1984
; and




(iii)
 shall transfer from the general fund as a loan to the Board on 
January 1, 1986
, the final one-third of the special amount described in subdivision (3) of this subsection, plus an amount equal to the interest that one-third would have earned had it been in the Railroad Retirement Account since 
January 1, 1984
.






(3)
 The special amount referred to in subdivision (2) of this subsection is the amount which, as of 
January 1, 1984
, would place the Railroad Retirement Account in the same position it would have been on that date if no annuity amounts had been paid during the period beginning 
January 1, 1975
 and ending 
September 30, 1981
, under sections 231b(h), 231c(e), and 231c(h) of this title and under sections 204(a)(3), 204(a)(4), 206(3), and 207(3) of 
Public Law 93–445
, and no sums had been appropriated as authorized in this subsection.

August 12, 1983
, under 
section 3102 of title 31
 and the purposes for which securities may be so issued are extended to include such purposes.

(e)
 Investments
At the request and direction of the Board, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter referred to as the “Secretary”) to invest such portion of the amounts credited to the Railroad Retirement Account and the Dual Benefits Payments Account as are not transferred to the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust as the Board may determine in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (A) on original issue at the issue price; or (B) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the accounts. Such obligations issued for purchase by the accounts shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the accounts, and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing notes of the United States then forming a part of the public debt that are not due or callable until after the expiration of three years from the end of such calendar month, except that where such rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest on such obligation shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such rate: 
Provided
, That the rate of interest on such obligations shall in no case be less than 3 per centum per annum. At the request of the Board the Secretary shall purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, or other obligations which are lawful investments for trust funds of the United States, on original issue or at the market price: 
Provided
, That the interest yield of such obligations shall not be less than the interest rate determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. At the request of the Board, the Secretary shall sell at the market price such obligations in the accounts (other than special obligations issued exclusively to the accounts) as the Board designates. The Board shall from time to time request the Secretary to redeem such special obligations issued exclusively to the accounts as the Board designates and upon such request the Secretary shall redeem such obligations at par plus accrued interest. All requests of the Board to the Secretary, provided for in this subsection, shall be mandatory upon the Secretary. It shall be the duty of the Board to determine at all times what proportion of the accounts shall be invested in other than special obligations issued to the accounts and further to determine which of such obligations available to the accounts consistent with the requirements of this subsection will provide the greatest rate of return on the funds invested.




(f)
 Actuarial Advisory Committee
The Board is hereby authorized and directed to select two actuaries, one from recommendations made by representatives of employees and the other from recommendations made by representatives of employers as defined in paragraph (i) of 
section 231(a)(1) of this title
. These actuaries, along with a third who shall be designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be known as the Actuarial Advisory Committee with respect to the Railroad Retirement Account. The actuaries so selected shall hold membership in the American Academy of Actuaries and shall be qualified in the evaluation of pension plans: 
Provided, however
, That these requirements shall not apply to any actuary who served as a member of the Committee prior to 
January 1, 1975
. The Committee shall examine the actuarial reports and estimates made by the Board and shall have authority to recommend to the Board such changes in actuarial methods as they may deem necessary. The compensation of the members of the Committee, exclusive of the member designated by the Secretary, shall be fixed by the Board on a per diem basis.

 Annual report
The Board shall include in its annual report a statement of the status and the operations of the Railroad Retirement and Railroad Retirement Supplemental Accounts, and the Dual Benefits Payments Account.

There are hereby authorized to be appropriated from time to time such sums as may be necessary to provide for the expenses of the Board in administering the provisions of this subchapter.




(i)
 Crediting of accounts for unnegotiated benefit checks
(1)
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall implement procedures to permit the identification of each check issued for benefits under this subchapter that has not been presented for payment by the close of the sixth month following the month of its issuance.




(2)
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall, on a monthly basis, credit each account established in the Treasury for the payment of benefits under this subchapter for the proportionate amount of benefit checks (including interest thereon) drawn on each such Account more than six months previously but not presented for payment and not previously credited to such Account, to the extent provided in advance in appropriation Acts.




(3)
 If a benefit check is presented for payment to the Treasury and the amount of the appropriate portion thereof has been previously credited pursuant to paragraph (2) to an Account or Accounts, the Secretary of the Treasury shall nevertheless pay such check, if otherwise proper, recharge such Account or Accounts for the amount of such check attributable to such Account or Accounts and notify the Board.




(4)
