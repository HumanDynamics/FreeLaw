Chapter 35
ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT

Not later than 6 months after the commencement of the negotiations under subsection (a), and not later than the end of every 6-month period thereafter until an agreement described in subsection (a) is concluded, the President shall report to the Committee on International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate on the progress made during these negotiations.




“(2)
 
Human rights reports
.—
In the report required in sections 116(d) and 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (
22 U.S.C. 2151n(b)

“(a)
 It is the sense of the Congress that the recent growth in international transfers of conventional arms to developing nations—
“(1)
 is a cause for grave concern for the United States and other nations in that in particular areas of the world it increases the danger of potential violence among nations, and diverts scarce world resources from more peaceful uses; and




“(2)
 could be controlled progressively through negotiations and agreements among supplier and recipient nations.




“(b)
 Therefore, the President is urged to propose to the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament that it consider as a high priority agenda item discussions among participating nations of that Conference for the purposes of—
“(1)
 agreeing to workable limitations on conventional arms transfers; and




“(2)
 establishing a mechanism through which such limitations could be effectively monitored.

 Findings
“(a)
 
Findings Concerning On-Site Inspection Personnel
.—
Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 The United States is currently engaged in multilateral and bilateral negotiations seeking to achieve treaties or agreements to reduce or eliminate various types of military weapons and to make certain reductions in military personnel levels. These negotiations include negotiations for (A) reductions in strategic forces, conventional armaments, and military personnel levels, (B) regimes for monitoring nuclear testing, and (C) the complete elimination of chemical weapons.




“(2)
 Requirements for monitoring these possible treaties or agreements will be extensive and will place severe stress on the monitoring capabilities of United States national technical means.




“(3)
 In the case of the INF Treaty, the United States and the Soviet Union negotiated, and are currently using, on-site inspection procedures to complement and support monitoring by national technical means. Similar on-site inspection procedures are being negotiated for inclusion in possible future treaties and agreements referred to in paragraph (1).




“(4)
 During initial implementation of the provisions of the INF Treaty, the United States was not fully prepared for the personnel requirements for the conduct of on-site inspections. The Director of Central Intelligence has stated that on-site inspection requirements for any strategic arms reduction treaty or agreement will be far more extensive than those for the INF Treaty. The number of locations within the Soviet Union that would possibly be subject to on-site inspections under a START agreement have been estimated to be approximately 2,500 (compared to 120 for the INF Treaty).




“(5)
 On-site inspection procedures are likely to be an integral part of any future arms control treaty or agreement.




“(6)
 Personnel requirements will be extensive for such on-site inspection procedures, both in terms of numbers of personnel and technical and linguistic skills. Since verification requirements for the INF Treaty are already placing severe stress on current personnel resources, the requirements for verification under START and other possible future treaties and agreements may quickly exceed the current number of verification personnel having necessary technical and language skills.




“(7)
 There is a clear need for a database of the names of individuals who are members of the Armed Forces or civilian employees of the United States Government, or of other citizens and nationals of the United States, who are qualified (by reason of technical or language skills) to participate in on-site inspections under an arms control treaty or agreement.




“(8)
 The organization best suited to establish such a database is the On-Site Inspection Agency (OSIA) of the Department of Defense, which was created by the President to implement (for the United States) the on-site inspection provisions of the INF Treaty.




“(b)
 
Status of the OSIA
.—
(1)
 Congress finds that—
“(A)
 the Director of the OSIA (currently a brigadier general of the Army) is appointed by the Secretary of Defense with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and the approval of the President;




“(B)
 the Secretary of Defense provides to the Director appropriate policy guidance formulated by the interagency arms control mechanism established by the President;




“(C)
 most of the personnel of the OSIA are members of the Armed Forces (who are trained and paid by the military departments within the Department of Defense) and include linguists, weapons specialists, and foreign area specialists;




“(D)
 the Department of Defense provides the OSIA with substantially all of its administrative and logistic support (including military air transportation for inspections in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe); and




“(E)
 the facilities in Europe and the United States at which OSIA personnel escort personnel of the Soviet Union conducting inspections under the on-site inspection terms of the INF Treaty are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense (or under the jurisdiction of entities that are contractors with the Department of Defense).






“(2)
 In light of the findings in paragraph (1) and the report submitted pursuant to 
section 909 of Public Law 100–456
 [div. A, title IX, 
Sept. 29, 1988
, 
102 Stat. 2036
] entitled ‘Report to the Congress on U.S. Monitoring and Verification Activities Related to the INF Treaty’ (submitted on 
July 27, 1989
), Congress hereby determines that by locating the On-Site Inspection Agency within the Department of Defense for the purposes of administrative and logistic support and operational guidance, and integrating on-site inspection responsibilities under the INF Treaty with existing organizational activities of that Department, the President has been able to ensure that sensitive national security assets are protected and that obligations of the United States under that treaty are fulfilled in an efficient and cost-effective manner.




“(c)
 
Establishment of Personnel Database
.—
(1)
 In light of the findings in subsection (a), the Director of the On-Site Inspection Agency shall establish a database consisting of the names of individuals who could be assigned or detailed (in the case of Government personnel) or employed (in the case of non-Government personnel) to participate in the conduct of on-site inspections under any future arms control treaty or agreement that includes provisions for such inspections.




“(2)
 The database should be composed of the names of individuals with skills (including linguistic and technical skills) necessary for the conduct of on-site inspections.




“(d)
 
INF Treaty Defined
.—
For purposes of this section, the term ‘INF Treaty’ means the Treaty Between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, signed in Washington, DC, on 
December 8, 1987
.”


 Policy coordination concerning implementation of on-site inspection provisions
(a)
 Interagency coordination
OSIA should receive policy guidance which is formulated through an interagency mechanism established by the President.




(b)
 Role of Secretary of Defense
The Secretary of Defense should provide to OSIA appropriate policy guidance formulated through the interagency mechanism described in subsection (a) of this section and operational direction, consistent with 
section 113(b) of title 10
.




(c)
 Role of Secretary of State
The Secretary of State should provide to the interagency mechanism described in subsection (a) of this section appropriate recommendations for policy guidance to OSIA consistent with sections 2551(3) and 2574(b) of this title.




 Repealed. 
 Review of certain reprogramming notifications
Any notification submitted to the Congress with respect to a proposed transfer, reprogramming, or reallocation of funds from or within the budget of OSIA shall also be submitted to the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and shall be subject to review by those committees.
