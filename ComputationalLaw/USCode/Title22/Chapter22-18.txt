“(a)
 Promotion of United States Values Through Broadcast Media.—
“(1)
 
Findings
.—
Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:
“(A)
 Although the United States has demonstrated and promoted its values in defending Muslims against tyrants and criminals in Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, this message is neither convincingly presented nor widely understood.




“(B)
 If the United States does not act to vigorously define its message in countries with predominantly Muslim populations, the image of the United States will be defined by Islamic extremists who seek to demonize the United States.




“(C)
 Recognizing that many Muslim audiences rely on satellite television and radio, the United States Government has launched promising initiatives in television and radio broadcasting to the Islamic world, including Iran and Afghanistan.






“(2)
 
Sense of congress
.—
It is the sense of Congress that—
“(A)
 the United States must do more to defend and promote its values and ideals to the broadest possible audience in countries with predominantly Muslim populations;




“(B)
 United States efforts to defend and promote these values and ideals are beginning to ensure that accurate expressions of these values reach large Muslim audiences and should be robustly supported;




“(C)
 the United States Government could and should do more to engage Muslim audiences in the struggle of ideas; and




“(D)
 the United States Government should more intensively employ existing broadcast media in the Islamic world as part of this engagement.






“(b)
 Enhancing Free and Independent Media.—
“(1)
 
Findings
.—
Congress makes the following findings:
“(A)
 Freedom of speech and freedom of the press are fundamental human rights.




“(B)
 The United States has a national interest in promoting these freedoms by supporting free media abroad, which is essential to the development of free and democratic societies consistent with our own.




“(C)
 Free media is undermined, endangered, or nonexistent in many repressive and transitional societies around the world, including in Eurasia, Africa, and the Middle East.




“(D)
 Individuals lacking access to a plurality of free media are vulnerable to misinformation and propaganda and are potentially more likely to adopt anti-United States views.




“(E)
 Foreign governments have a responsibility to actively and publicly discourage and rebut unprofessional and unethical media while respecting journalistic integrity and editorial independence.






“(2)
 
Statement of policy
.—
It shall be the policy of the United States, acting through the Secretary of State, to—

 Authority of Secretary of State
“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds that the overriding national security aspects of the $1,300,000,000 facilities modernization program of the Voice of America require the assurance of uninterrupted logistic support under all circumstances for the program. Therefore, it is in the best interests of the United States to provide a preference for United States contractors bidding on the projects of this program.


“(b)
 
Responsive Bid
.—
A bid shall not be treated as a responsive bid for purposes of the facilities modernization program of the Voice of America unless the bidder can establish that the United States goods and services content, excluding consulting and management fees, of his proposal and the resulting contract will not be less than 55 percent of the value of his proposal and the resulting total contract.


“(c)
 
Preference for United States Contractors
.—
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case where there are two or more qualified bidders on projects of the facilities modernization program of the Voice of America, including design and construction projects and projects with respect to transmitters, antennas, spare parts, and other technical equipment, all the responsive bids of United States persons and qualified United States joint venture persons shall be considered to be reduced by 10 percent.

“(i)
 its national public radio and television sector, or




“(ii)
 its private radio and television sector, to the extent that such procurement or project is, in whole or in part, funded or otherwise under the control of a government agency or authority; or






“(C)
 the Secretary of Commerce certifies (in advance of the award of the contract for that project) to the Director of the United States Information Agency that the foreign bidder is not receiving any direct subsidy from any government, the effect of which would be to disadvantage the competitive position of United States persons who also bid on the project; or




“(D)
 the statutes of a host foreign country prohibit the use of United States contractors on such projects within that country.






“(2)
 An exception under paragraph (1)(D) shall only become effective with respect to a foreign country 30 days after the Secretary of State certifies to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate what specific actions the Secretary has taken to urge the foreign country to permit the use of United States contractors on such projects.
