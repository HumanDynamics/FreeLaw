 Policy

(2)
 to declare that peace and stability in the area are in the political, security, and economic interests of the United States, and are matters of international concern;




(3)
 to make clear that the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;
