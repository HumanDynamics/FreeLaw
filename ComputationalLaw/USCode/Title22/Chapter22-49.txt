Chapter 49
SUPPORT OF PEACE TREATY BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL
 Congressional findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 Policy of support for peace treaty
It is the policy of the United States to support the peace treaty concluded between the Government of Egypt and the Government of Israel on 
March 26, 1979
. This treaty is a significant step toward a full and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The Congress urges the President to continue to exert every effort to bring about a comprehensive peace and to seek an end by all parties to the violence which could jeopardize this peace.




(b)
 Findings
The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel having been ratified, the Congress finds that the national interests of the United States are served—
(1)
 by authorizing the President to construct air bases in Israel to replace the Israeli air bases on the Sinai peninsula that are to be evacuated;




(2)
 by authorizing additional funds to finance procurements by Egypt and Israel through the fiscal year 1982 of defense articles and defense services for their respective security requirements; and




(3)
 by authorizing additional funds for economic assistance for Egypt in order to promote the economic stability and development of that country and to support the peace process in the Middle East.




(c)
 Other agreements, understandings, or commitments
The authorities contained in this subchapter to implement certain arrangements in support of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel do not signify approval by the Congress of any other agreement, understanding, or commitment made by the executive branch.




“(a)
 It is the sense of the Congress that all parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict need to reaffirm their unequivocal commitment to the peace process in order to achieve further progress toward a comprehensive settlement, to reinforce the principles of the Camp David accords, and to take actions to encourage parties not currently involved in the peace process to become active participants in peace efforts.


“(b)
 It is further the sense of the Congress that to further these goals (1) all parties to the conflict should accept Israel’s unequivocal right to exist within secure and recognized borders; (2) the Governments of Israel and Egypt should maintain and strengthen their commitment to the process of normalization of relations and continue actions to support that commitment; (3) the Governments of Israel and Egypt should reaffirm their commitment to United Nations Resolution 242 and its applicability, in all its aspects, to territories under negotiations; and (4) the governments of countries in the Middle East should assure that their policies and actions are consistent with the objectives of achieving peace and of involving other parties in the peace process.”


 Supplemental authorization of foreign military sales loan guaranties for Egypt and Israel
(a)
 Congressional findings; use of Arms Export Control Act procedures
The Congress finds that the legitimate defense interests of Israel and Egypt require a one time extraordinary assistance package due to Israel’s phased withdrawal from the Sinai and Egypt’s shift from reliance on Soviet weaponry. The authorizations contained in this section do not, however, constitute Congressional approval of the sale of any particular weapons system to either country. These sales will be reviewed under the normal procedures set forth in section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [
22 U.S.C. 2776(b)
].




(b)
 Authorization of appropriation
In addition to amounts authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year 1979 by section 31(a) of the Arms Export Control Act [
22 U.S.C. 2771(a)
], there is authorized to be appropriated to the President to carry out that Act [
22 U.S.C. 2751
 et seq.] $370,000,000 for the fiscal year 1979.




(c)
 Principal amounts of guaranteed loans
Funds made available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may be used only for guaranties for Egypt and Israel pursuant to section 24(a) of the Arms Export Control Act [
22 U.S.C. 2764(a)
]. The principal amount of loans guaranteed with such funds may not exceed $3,700,000,000 of which $2,200,000,000 shall be available only for Israel and $1,500,000,000 shall be available only for Egypt. The principal amount of such guaranteed loans shall be in addition to the aggregate ceiling authorized for the fiscal year 1979 by section 31(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [
22 U.S.C. 2771(b)
].




(d)
 Repayment schedule
Loans guaranteed with funds made available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be on terms calling for repayment within a period of not less than thirty years, including an initial grace period of ten years on repayment of principal.




(e)
 Modification of terms of guaranteed loans
(1)
 The Congress finds that the Governments of Israel and Egypt each have an enormous external debt burden which may be made more difficult by virtue of the financing authorized by this section. The Congress further finds that, as a consequence of the impact of the debt burdens incurred by Israel and Egypt under such financing, it may become necessary in future years to modify the terms of the loans guaranteed with funds made available pursuant to this section.

The President is authorized to transfer to Egypt, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, such of the facilities and related property of the United States Sinai Field Mission as he may determine, upon the termination of the activities of the Sinai Field Mission in accordance with the terms of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.
 Contributions by other countries to support peace in the Middle East
(a)
 Presidential consultations with other countries
It is the sense of the Congress that other countries should give favorable consideration to providing support for the implementation of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Therefore, the Congress requests that the President consult with other countries in order to (1) promote and develop an agreement for the establishment of a peace development fund whose purpose would be to underwrite the costs of implementing a Middle East peace, and (2) encourage investments in Israel and Egypt and other countries in the region should they join in Middle East peace agreements.

 Trilateral scientific and technological cooperation by Egypt, Israel, and United States
(a)
 Preparation for United States participation

(b)
 Plan development
