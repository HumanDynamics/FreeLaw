Chapter 7
INTERNATIONAL BUREAUS, CONGRESSES, ETC.
 Policy as to settlement of disputes and disarmament
It is declared to be the policy of the United States to adjust and settle its international disputes through mediation or arbitration, to the end that war may be honorably avoided. It looks with apprehension and disfavor upon a general increase of armament throughout the world, but it realizes that no single nation can disarm, and that without a common agreement upon the subject every considerable power must maintain a relative standing in military strength.

 Commitments for United States contributions to international financial institutions fostering economic development in less developed countries; continuation of participation
(a)
 Congressional findings
It is the sense of the Congress that—
(1)
 for humanitarian, economic, and political reasons, it is in the national interest of the United States to assist in fostering economic development in the less developed countries of this world;




(2)
 the development-oriented international financial institutions have proved themselves capable of playing a significant role in assisting economic development by providing to less developed countries access to capital and technical assistance and soliciting from them maximum self-help and mutual cooperation;




(3)
 this has been achieved with minimal risk of financial loss to contributing countries;




(4)
 such institutions have proved to be an effective mechanism for sharing the burden among developed countries of stimulating economic development in the less developed world; and




(5)
 although continued United States participation in the international financial institutions is an important part of efforts by the United States to assist less developed countries, more of this burden should be shared by other developed countries. As a step in that direction, in future negotiations, the United States should work toward aggregate contributions to future replenishments to international financial institutions covered by this Act not to exceed 25 per centum.




(b)
 Funding commitments to international financial institutions; availability of funds subject to appropriations
The Congress recognizes that economic development is a long-term process needing funding commitments to international financial institutions. It also notes that the availability of funds for the United States contribution to international financial institutions is subject to the appropriations process.




“(a)
 The Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury shall initiate a wide consultation designed to develop a viable standard for the meeting of basic human needs and the protection of human rights and a mechanism for acting together to insure that the rewards of international economic cooperation are especially available to those who subscribe to such standards and are seen to be moving toward making them effective in their own systems of governance.


“(b)
 Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act [
Oct. 3, 1977
], the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury shall report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on the progress made in carrying out this section.”

 Financial assistance to international financial institutions; considerations and criteria
(a)
 Congressional declaration of intent
United States active participation in international financial institution activity is based on our national objective of furthering the economic and social development of the nations of the world, in particular the developing nations. The attainment of this national objective is most effectively realized through a world economic and financial system which is both free and stable. Therefore, it is the intent of the United States Congress that United States financial assistance to the international financial institutions should be primarily directed to those projects that would not generate excess commodity supplies in world markets, displace private investment initiatives or foster departures from a market-oriented economy.




(b)
 Effect of country adjustment programs; minimization of projected adverse impacts; avoidance of government subsidization
The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the representatives of the United States to the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) of this section to take into account in their review of loans, credits, or other utilization of the resources of their respective institutions, the effect that country adjustment programs would have upon individual industry sectors and international commodity markets in order to—
(1)
 minimize any projected adverse impacts on such sector or markets of making such loans, credits, or utilization of resources; and




(2)
 avoid whenever possible government subsidization of production and exports of international commodities without regard to economic conditions in the markets for such commodities.




(c)
 Project proposals relating to mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products
More specifically, the following criteria should be considered as a basis for a vote by the respective United States Executive Director to each of the international financial institutions described in subsection (d) of this section against a project proposal involving the creation of new capacity or the expansion, improvement, or modification of mining, smelting, refining, and fabricating of minerals and metal products:
(1)
 Analysis shows that the risks, returns, and incentives of a project are such that it could be financed at reasonable terms by commercial lending services.




(2)
 Analysis by the United States Bureau of Mines indicates that surplus capacity in the industry for the primary product of the defined project would exist over half the period of the economic life of the project because of projected world demand and capacity conditions.




(3)
 United States imports of the commodity constitute less than 50 percent of the domestic production of the primary product in those cases where the United States is the substantial producer of such commodities.




(d)
 International financial institutions
The international financial institutions referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section are the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the African Development Bank.

(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—

 improvement in the capacity of developing countries to measure and monitor regularly the nutritional and physical well-being of the poorest 40 percent of the population of each of such countries is essential to the development of policies to reduce absolute poverty;




(2)
 internationally accepted statistical indicators that measure reliably the extent of absolute poverty and identify the location and characteristics of the poor are being developed and refined to guide policy formulation and target assistance to the poor;

 the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Development Association have the technical and financial capability to assist borrowing country governments to develop such statistical measurement capabilities for social indicators necessary for the design and monitoring of poverty-reduction policies for such governments;




(5)
 availability of social indicator data is also essential to the work of such institutions, particularly in monitoring the impact of structural adjustment lending on the poor; and

 A major objective of such bank’s operations and financing in each borrowing country, as a long term priority, should be to increase the productive role of the poor in the economy of such country.




(2)
 Such bank should encourage and assist each borrowing country to develop sustainable national plans and strategies to eliminate the causes and alleviate the manifestations of poverty which keep the poor from leading economically and socially productive lives.

(3)
 As an integral element of ongoing policy dialogue with each borrowing country to design structural adjustment plans and project lending programs, such bank should provide assistance consistent with achieving the objectives of the country’s national plan for increasing the productive economic participation of the poor. Such dialogue should be conducted with government agencies working in social and economic sectors and with non-governmental groups in the borrowing country, especially those that have grassroots involvement with poor people.




(4)
 In an annual review document, such bank should describe the extent to which the goal of increasing the productive economic participation of the poor is being advanced or retarded and the steps that are being taken to overcome obstacles to its fulfillment. Such review should be based on information contained in the bank’s country implementation review documents and in the country strategy documents for each borrowing country. Such country strategy documents should describe the national strategy for productive economic participation of the poor and the steps the bank plans to take to assist the borrowing country during the period covered by the country strategy document.




(5)
 Such bank should assist countries in assessing and monitoring progress in achieving poverty alleviation goals and targets through measurement by appropriate social indicators.

“(a)
 
Prohibition
.—
No funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or any other Act shall be available for the United Nations or any specialized agency thereof which accords the Palestine Liberation Organization the same standing as member states.


“(b)
 
Transfer or Reprogramming
.—
Funds subject to the prohibition contained in subsection (a) which would be available for the United Nations or any specialized agency thereof (but for that prohibition) are authorized to remain available until expended and may be reprogrammed or transferred to any other account of the Department of State or the Agency for International Development to carry out the general purposes for which such funds were authorized.”


“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 In April 1986, the Secretary-General of the United Nations adopted a freeze on the hiring of personnel within the United Nations Secretariat.




“(2)
 The conditions of the freeze were such that, as the terms of office for the personnel expired, replacements would not be recruited or hired to fill the vacant positions, with minor exceptions.




“(3)
 The freeze was designed to reduce United Nations personnel by 15 percent over three years, as recommended by the Group of High-Level Intergovernmental Experts to Review the Efficiency of the Administrative and Financial Functioning of the United Nations (commonly referred to as the ‘Group of 18 Experts’).




“(4)
 On 
May 5, 1987
, the Secretary-General reported to the Department of State that he was considering granting 156 exceptions to the hiring freeze.




“(5)
 Of these 156 probable exceptions, 104 would be Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat—of 298 Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently employed in the United Nations Secretariat—who would be replaced over the next 18 months.




“(6)
 According to a report from the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate on ‘Soviet Presence in the United Nations Secretariat’ (Senate Print 99–52, May 1985), approximately one-fourth of the Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat are intelligence officers, many more are co-opted by the Soviet intelligence agencies, and all Soviets in the United Nations Secretariat must respond to KGB requests for assistance.




“(7)
 Other United States intelligence authorities estimate that as many as one-half of the Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals in the United Nations Secretariat are officers of the KGB or the GRU.




“(8)
 If the Secretary-General’s probable exemptions are adopted, the Soviet Union will be allowed to replace retiring Soviet and Soviet-bloc personnel with new, highly skilled and well-trained intelligence officers of the KGB or the GRU.




“(9)
 The Secretary-General’s proposed exceptions would thus provide the Soviet Union with the capability to rebuild its intelligence apparatus within the United States, which was devastated in recent years when the United States ordered severe reductions in the size of the Soviet mission to the United Nations, the Soviet Embassy in Washington, District of Columbia, and the Soviet Consulate in San Francisco, California.




“(10)
 Article 100 of the United Nations Charter calls for the establishment of an international civil service whose members are neutral and loyal only to the United Nations.




“(11)
 Section 3 of Article 101 of the United Nations Charter calls for the appointment of individuals who are professionally qualified for the positions they are to fill and maintains that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.




“(12)
 As of September 1985, 442 of 446 Soviet nationals employed throughout the United Nations system are ‘seconded’, that is, serve on short, fixed-term contracts.




“(13)
 Through the abuse of short, fixed-term contracts, the Soviet Union has maintained undue influence and control over major offices of the United Nations Secretariat, thereby effectively using the United Nations Secretariat in the conduct of its foreign relations, in clear violation of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter.




“(14)
 The Secretary-General’s proposed exceptions to the hiring freeze (as described in paragraphs (1) through (5)) would continue the gross violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter described in paragraph (13).




“(15)
 The Secretary-General’s proposed exceptions to such hiring freeze would be clearly inconsistent with the terms of the United Nation’s self-imposed reform program.




“(16)
 The United Nations has not yet achieved its reform goals and there is no indication that the United Nations can afford to make such large exceptions to such hiring freeze.




“(b)
 
Sense of the Congress
.—
It is the sense of the Congress that—
“(1)
 the President should take all such actions necessary to ensure compliance with the hiring freeze rule, including withholding all assessed United States contributions to the United Nations, and denying United States entry visas to Soviet and Soviet-bloc applicants coming to the United States to replace Soviet and Soviet-bloc nationals currently serving in the United Nations Secretariat;




“(2)
 the President, through the Department of State and the United States mission to the United Nations, should express to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the insistence of the American people that the hiring freeze continue indefinitely, or until the United Nations has complied with the Group of 18 recommendations and can thus afford to make exceptions to the freeze;




“(3)
 the Secretary-General should revoke all exceptions to the hiring freeze rule, excepting those member-nations which have 15 or fewer nationals serving in the United Nations Secretariat, or those positions not subject to geographical representation, such as those of the general service category;




“(4)
 the long-term, flagrant violations of Articles 100 and 101 of the United Nations Charter and the abuse of secondment by the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc member-nations are reprehensible;




“(5)
 the United Nations should adopt the recommendations of the Group of 18 (as referred to in subsection (a)(3)) that no member-nation be allowed to have more than 50 percent of its nationals employed under fixed-term contracts;




“(6)
 the Soviet Union is hereby condemned for—
“(A)
 its refusal to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter calling for an international civil service,




“(B)
 its abuse of secondment, and




“(C)
 its absolute disregard of the solemn purpose of the United Nations to be an international civil service; and






“(7)
 if the Soviet Union and the Soviet-bloc intend to remain member-nations of the United Nations, they should adhere to Articles 100, 101, and all other principles of the United Nations Charter to which every other member-nation must adhere.




“(c)
 
Definition
.—
For the purposes of this section, the term ‘Soviet-bloc’ means the countries of Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Nicaragua, North Korea, Poland, and Romania.”


“(a)
 
United States Policy
.—
It is the policy of the United States to seek the implementation by the United Nations of the recommendation by the International Civil Service Commission to deduct from the pay (commonly referred to as a ‘rental deduction’) of an international civil servant the amount of any housing allowance or payment which is provided by any member state to that international civil servant, in accordance with Article 100 of the Charter of the United Nations and regulations thereunder.


“(b)
 
United States Ambassador to the United Nations
.—
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations shall seek to promote the adoption of the recommendation described in subsection (a).”


“(a)
 
Assessed Contributions
.—
For assessed contributions authorized to be appropriated for ‘Assessed Contributions to International Organizations’ by this Act [
108 Stat. 382
, 388], the President may withhold 20 percent of the funds appropriated for the United States assessed contribution to the United Nations or to any of its specialized agencies for any calendar year if the United Nations or any such agency has failed to implement or to continue to implement consensus-based decisionmaking procedures on budgetary matters which assure that sufficient attention is paid to the views of the United States and other member states that are the major financial contributors to such assessed budgets.


“(b)
 
Notice to Congress
.—
The President shall notify the Congress when a decision is made to withhold any share of the United States assessed contribution to the United Nations or its specialized agencies pursuant to subsection (a) and shall notify the Congress when the decision is made to pay any previously withheld assessed contribution. A notification under this subsection shall include appropriate consultation between the President (or the President’s representative) and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.


“(c)
 
Contributions for Prior Years
.—
Subject to the availability of appropriations, payment of assessed contributions for prior years may be made to the United Nations or any of its specialized agencies notwithstanding subsection (a) if such payment would further United States interests in that organization.
