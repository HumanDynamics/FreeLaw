 finds that such fund is in excess of an amount adequate to meet future interest and principal payments on all such bonds, he may, with the approval of the Philippine Government, purchase with such excess any other bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, municipalities, and instrumentalities.

July 4, 1946
; and the Philippine Government shall turn over to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for destruction all such bonds that are then held, canceled, or uncanceled, in any of the sinking funds maintained for the payment of such bonds.

May 1, 1934
, under authority of Acts of Congress, the Philippine Government shall, on or before 
July 3, 1946
, pay to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for deposit in such special trust account an amount which said Secretary of the Treasury determines is required to assure payment of principal and interest on such bonds: 
Provided, however
, That if the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States finds that this requirement would impose an undue hardship upon the Philippines, then the Philippine Government shall continue to provide annually the necessary funds for the payment of interest and principal on such bonds until such time as the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States determines that the amount in the special trust account is adequate to meet interest and principal payments on such bonds.

July 4, 1946
, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is authorized, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, to purchase at the market price for the special trust account bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to 
May 1, 1934
, under authority of Acts of Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury of the United States is also authorized, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, to invest all or any part of such special trust account in any interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in any obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Such obligations may be acquired on original issue at the issue price or by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price, and any obligations acquired by the special trust account may, with the approval of the independent Government of the Philippines, be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price, and the proceeds of the payment upon maturity or redemption of such obligations shall be held as a part of such special trust account. Whenever the special trust account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be adequate to meet interest and principal payments on all outstanding bonds of the Philippines, its Provinces, cities, and municipalities, issued prior to 
May 1, 1934
, under authority of Acts of Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to pay from such trust account the principal of such outstanding bonds and to pay all interest due and owing on such bonds. All such bonds and interest coupons paid or purchased by the special trust account shall be canceled and destroyed by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. From time to time after 
July 4, 1946
, any moneys in such special trust account found by the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States to be in excess of an amount adequate to meet interest and principal payments on all such bonds shall be turned over to the treasurer of the independent Government of the Philippines.
