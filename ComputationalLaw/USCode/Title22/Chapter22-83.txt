 staffing levels for United States country-level HIV/AIDS teams should be adequately maintained to fulfill oversight and other obligations of the positions.




 HIV/AIDS Working Capital Fund
 Sense of Congress on public-private partnerships
(a)
 Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1)
 Innovative partnerships between governments and organizations in the private sector (including foundations, universities, corporations, faith-based and community-based organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations) have proliferated in recent years, particularly in the area of health.




(2)
 Public-private sector partnerships multiply local and international capacities to strengthen the delivery of health services in developing countries and to accelerate research for vaccines and other pharmaceutical products that are essential to combat infectious diseases decimating the populations of these countries.




(3)
 These partnerships maximize the unique capabilities of each sector while combining financial and other resources, scientific knowledge, and expertise toward common goals which neither the public nor the private sector can achieve alone.




(4)
 Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and building new ones are critical to the success of the international community’s efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases around the globe.




(b)
 Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1)
 the sustainment and promotion of public-private partnerships should be a priority element of the strategy pursued by the United States to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other global health crises; and




(2)
 the United States should systematically track the evolution of these partnerships and work with others in the public and private sector to profile and build upon those models that are most effective.




 Participation in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
(a)
 Findings; sense of Congress
(1)
 Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(A)
 The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (
Public Law 106–264
) [
22 U.S.C. 6801
 et seq.].




(B)
 The Global Fund is an innovative financing mechanism which—
(i)
 has made progress in many areas in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and




(ii)
 represents the multilateral component of this chapter, extending United States efforts to more than 130 countries around the world.






(C)
 The Global Fund and United States bilateral assistance programs—
(i)
 are demonstrating increasingly effective coordination, with each possessing certain comparative advantages in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and




(ii)
 often work most effectively in concert with each other.






(D)
 The United States Government—
(i)
 is the largest supporter of the Global Fund in terms of resources and technical support;




(ii)
 made the founding contribution to the Global Fund; and




(iii)
 is fully committed to the success of the Global Fund as a multilateral public-private partnership.








(2)
 Sense of Congress

 providing clearer guidance for and oversight of Local Fund Agents; and




(iii)
 strengthening the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund;






(C)
 the provision of sufficient resources and authority to the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund to ensure that office has the staff and independence necessary to carry out its mandate will be a measure of the commitment of the Global Fund to transparency and accountability;




(D)
 regular, publicly published financial, programmatic, and reporting audits of the Fund, its grantees, and Local Fund Agents are also important benchmarks of transparency;




(E)
 the Global Fund should establish and maintain a system to track—
(i)
 the amount of funds disbursed to each subrecipient on the grant’s fiscal cycle; and




(ii)
 the distribution of resources, by grant and principal recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, drug and commodity purchases, and other purposes;






(F)
 relevant national authorities in recipient countries should exempt from duties and taxes all products financed by Global Fund grants and procured by any principal recipient or subrecipient for the purpose of carrying out such grants;




(G)
 the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and the Global AIDS Coordinator should work together to standardize program indicators wherever possible;




(H)
