(a)
 
Threshold

Stay of civil action
.—
If the petitioner or real party in interest files a civil action challenging the validity of a claim of the patent on or after the date on which the petitioner files a petition for inter partes review of the patent, that civil action shall be automatically stayed until either—

 the petitioner or real party in interest moves the court to dismiss the civil action.
