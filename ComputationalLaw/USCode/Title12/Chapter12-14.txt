(A)
 any group that the Board determines, in writing and in accordance with the guidelines and regulations issued under paragraph (3), could not feasibly or reasonably establish a new single common-bond credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(1) of this section because—

(e)
 Additional membership eligibility provisions
(1)
 Membership eligibility limited to immediate family or household members

(2)
 Retention of membership
Except as provided in 
section 1764 of this title
, once a person becomes a member of a credit union in accordance with this subchapter, that person or organization may remain a member of that credit union until the person or organization chooses to withdraw from the membership of the credit union.






(f)
 Criteria for approval of expansion of multiple common-bond credit unions
(1)
 In general
The Board shall—
(A)
 encourage the formation of separately chartered credit unions instead of approving an application to include an additional group within the field of membership of an existing credit union whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union; and




(B)
 if the formation of a separate credit union by the group is not practicable or consistent with the standards referred to in subparagraph (A), require the inclusion of the group in the field of membership of a credit union that is within reasonable proximity to the location of the group whenever practicable and consistent with reasonable standards for the safe and sound operation of the credit union.






(2)
 Approval criteria
The Board may not approve any application by a Federal credit union, the field of membership category of which is described in subsection (b)(2) of this section to include any additional group within the field of membership of the credit union (or an application by a Federal credit union described in subsection (b)(1) of this section to include an additional group and become a credit union described in subsection (b)(2) of this section), unless the Board determines, in writing, that—
(A)
 the credit union has not engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice (as defined in 
section 1786(b) of this title
) that is material during the 1-year period preceding the date of filing of the application;




(B)
 the credit union is adequately capitalized;




(C)
 the credit union has the administrative capability to serve the proposed membership group and the financial resources to meet the need for additional staff and assets to serve the new membership group;




(D)
 any potential harm that the expansion of the field of membership of the credit union may have on any other insured credit union and its members is clearly outweighed in the public interest by the probable beneficial effect of the expansion in meeting the convenience and needs of the members of the group proposed to be included in the field of membership; and




(E)
 the credit union has met such additional requirements as the Board may prescribe, by regulation.






(g)
 Regulations required for community credit unions
(1)
 Definition of well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district
The Board shall prescribe, by regulation, a definition for the term “well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district” for purposes of—
(A)
 making any determination with regard to the field of membership of a credit union described in subsection (b)(3) of this section; and




(B)
 establishing the criteria applicable with respect to any such determination.






(2)
 Scope of application
The definition prescribed by the Board under paragraph (1) shall apply with respect to any application to form a new credit union, or to alter or expand the field of membership of an existing credit union, that is filed with the Board after 
August 7, 1998
.

The management of a Federal credit union shall be by a board of directors, a supervisory committee, and where the bylaws so provide, a credit committee.

Only one board officer may be compensated as an officer of the board and the bylaws shall specify such position as well as the specific duties of each of the board officers.

 Board of directors; meetings; powers and duties; executive committee; membership officers; membership application
 Credit committee
(a)
 Members; meetings; lines of credit and approval of loans; delegation to loan officers
If the bylaws provide for a credit committee, then pursuant to the provisions of the bylaws, the board of directors may appoint or the members may elect a credit committee which shall consist of an odd number of members of the credit union, but which shall not include more than one loan officer. The method used shall be set forth in the bylaws. The credit committee shall hold such meetings as the business of the Federal credit union may require, not less frequently than once a month, to consider applications for loans or lines of credit. Reasonable notice of such meetings shall be given to all members of the committee. Except for those loans or lines of credit required to be approved by the board of directors in 
section 1757(5) of this title
, approval of an application shall be by majority of the committee who are present at the meeting at which it is considered provided that a majority of the full committee is present. The credit committee may appoint and delegate to loan officers the authority to approve applications.




(b)
 Review and reversal of loan refusals; review by board in lieu of committee; limitation on disbursements by loan officers
If the bylaws provide for a credit committee, all applications not approved by the loan officer shall be reviewed by the credit committee, and the approval of a majority of the members who are present at the meeting when such review is undertaken shall be required to reverse the loan officer’s decision provided a majority of the full committee is present. If there is not a credit committee, a member shall have the right upon written request of review by the board of directors of a loan application which has been denied. No individual shall have authority to disburse funds of the Federal credit union with respect to any loan or line of credit for which the application has been approved by him in his capacity as a loan officer.




 Supervisory committee; powers and duties; suspension of members; passbook
The supervisory committee shall make or cause to be made an annual audit and shall submit a report of that audit to the board of directors and a summary of the report to the members at the next annual meeting of the credit union; shall make or cause to be made such supplementary audits as it deems necessary or as may be ordered by the Board, and submit reports of the supplementary audits to the board of directors; may by a unanimous vote suspend any officer of the credit union or any member of the credit committee or of the board of directors, until the next members’ meeting, which shall be held not less than seven or more than fourteen days after any such suspension, at which meeting any such suspension shall be acted upon by the members; and may call by a majority vote a special meeting of the members to consider any violations of this chapter, the charter, or the bylaws, or any practice of the credit union deemed by the supervisory committee to be unsafe or unauthorized. Any member of the supervisory committee may be suspended by a majority vote of the board of directors. The members shall decide, at a meeting held not less than seven nor more than fourteen days after any such suspension, whether the suspended committee member shall be removed from or restored to the supervisory committee. The supervisory committee shall cause the passbooks and accounts of the members to be verified with the records of the treasurer from time to time, and not less frequently than once every two years. As used in this section, the term “passbook” shall include any book, statement of account, or other record approved by the Board for use by Federal credit unions.
 Repealed. 
 Dividends
At such intervals as the board of directors may authorize, and after provision for required reserves, the board of directors may declare a dividend to be paid at different rates on different types of shares, at different rates and maturity dates in the case of share certificates, and at different rates on different types of share draft accounts. Dividends credited may be accrued on various types of shares, share certificates, and share draft accounts as authorized by the board of directors. If the par value of a share exceeds $5, dividends shall be paid on all funds in the regular share account once a full share has been purchased.
 Expulsion and withdrawal
(a)
 Expulsion by two-thirds vote
Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a member may be expelled by a two-thirds vote of the members of a Federal credit union present at a special meeting called for the purpose, but only after opportunity has been given him to be heard.




(b)
 Expulsion based on nonparticipation
The board of directors of a Federal credit union may, by majority vote of a quorum of directors, adopt and enforce a policy with respect to expulsion from membership based on nonparticipation by a member in the affairs of the credit union. In establishing its policy, the board should consider a member’s failure to vote in annual credit union elections or failure to purchase shares from, obtain a loan from, or lend to the Federal credit union. If such a policy is adopted, written notice of the policy as adopted and the effective date of such policy shall be mailed to each member of the credit union at the member’s current address appearing on the records of the credit union not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of such policy. In addition, each new member shall be provided written notice of any such policy prior to or upon applying for membership.




(c)
 Liability to credit union
Withdrawal or expulsion of a member pursuant to either subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall not operate to relieve him from liability to the Federal credit union. The amount to be paid a withdrawing or expelled member by a Federal credit union shall be determined and paid in a manner specified in the bylaws.




 Minors
Shares may be issued in the name of a minor or in trust, subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by the bylaws. When shares are issued in trust, the name of the beneficiary shall be disclosed to the Federal credit union.

(3)

(2)
 If the rate prescribed in paragraph (1) exceeds the rate such credit union would be permitted to charge in the absence of this subsection, and such State fixed rate is thereby preempted by the rate described in paragraph (1), the taking, receiving, reserving, or charging a greater rate than is allowed by paragraph (1), when knowingly done, shall be deemed a forfeiture of the entire interest which the loan carries with it, or which has been agreed to be paid thereon. If such greater rate of interest has been paid, the person who paid it may recover, in a civil action commenced in a court of appropriate jurisdiction not later than two years after the date of such payment, an amount equal to twice the amount of interest paid from the credit union taking or receiving such interest.

 In general
The submission by any person of any information to the Administration, any State credit union supervisor, or foreign banking authority for any purpose in the course of any supervisory or regulatory process of such Board, supervisor, or authority shall not be construed as waiving, destroying, or otherwise affecting any privilege such person may claim with respect to such information under Federal or State law as to any person or entity other than such Board, supervisor, or authority.

(a)
 Termination of insurance
(1)
 Any insured credit union other than a Federal credit union may, upon not less than ninety days’ written notice to the Board and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of its members within one year prior to the giving of such notice, terminate its status as an insured credit union.




(2)
 Any insured credit union, other than a Federal credit union, which has obtained a new certificate of insurance from a corporation authorized and duly licensed to insure member accounts may upon not less than ninety days’ written notice to the Board convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter: 
Provided
, That at the time of giving notice to the Board the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are not being invoked against the credit union.




(b)
 Unsound condition of credit union; notice to correct condition; hearing; judicial review
(1)
 Whenever, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union is engaging or has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of such credit union, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations as an insured credit union, or is violating or has violated an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with any action on any application, notice, or other request by the credit union or institution-affiliated party,, 
1
1
 So in original.
 or is violating or has violated any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board shall serve upon the credit union a statement with respect to such practices or conditions or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof. In the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board shall send a copy of such statement to the commission, board, or authority, if any, having supervision of such credit union. Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred and twenty days after service of such statement, or within such shorter period of not less than twenty days after such service as the Board shall require in any case where it determines that the insurance risk with respect to such credit union could be unduly jeopardized by further delay in the correction of such practices or conditions or violations, or as the commission, board, or authority having supervision of such credit union, if any, shall require in the case of an insured State-chartered credit union, the Board, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the credit union not less than thirty days’ written notice of its intention to terminate the status of the credit union as an insured credit union. Such notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged unsafe and unsound practices or conditions or violations and shall fix a time and place for a hearing thereon. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of the credit union. Unless the credit union shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall be deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured credit union. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing the Board shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or condition or violation specified in the notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above-prescribed in which to make such correction, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union an order terminating its status as an insured credit union on a date subsequent to the date of such finding and subsequent to the expiration of the time specified in the notice.




(2)
 Any credit union whose insured status has been terminated by order of the Board under this subsection shall have the right of judicial review of such order only to the same extent as provided for the review of orders under subsection (j) of this section.




(c)
 Notice to members of termination of insured status
In the event of the termination of a credit union’s status as an insured credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, the credit union shall give prompt and reasonable notice to all of its members whose accounts are insured that it has ceased to be an insured credit union. It may include in such notice a statement of the fact that member accounts insured on the effective date of such termination, to the extent not withdrawn, remain insured for one year from the date of such termination, but it shall not further represent itself in any manner as an insured credit union. In the event of failure to give the notice as herein provided to members whose accounts are insured, the Board is authorized to give reasonable notice.




(d)
 Continuation of insurance for one year; approval of conversion of status; procedure subsequent to approval; reduction of premium charges
(1)
 After the termination of the insured status of any credit union as provided under subsection (a)(1) or (b) of this section, insurance of its member accounts to the extent that they were insured on the effective date of such termination, less any amounts thereafter withdrawn which reduce the accounts below the amount covered by insurance on the effective date of such termination, shall continue for a period of one year, but no shares issued by the credit union or deposits made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Board. The credit union shall continue to maintain its deposit with and pay premiums to the Board during such period as in the case of an insured credit union and the Board shall have the right to examine such credit union from time to time during the period during which such insurance continues. Such credit union shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured credit union for the period of one year from the date of such termination. In the event that such credit union shall be closed for liquidation within such period of one year, the Board shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such credit union as in the case of an insured credit union. Notwithstanding the above, when an insured credit union’s insured status is terminated and the credit union subsequently obtains comparable insurance coverage from another source, insurance of its accounts by the fund may cease immediately upon the effective date of such comparable coverage by mutual consent of the credit union and the Board.




(2)
 No credit union shall convert from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section until the proposition for such conversion has been approved by a majority of all the directors of the credit union, and by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the credit union who vote on the proposition in a vote in which at least 20 per centum of the total membership of the credit union participates. Following approval by the directors, written notice of the proposition and of the date set for the membership vote shall be delivered in person to each member, or mailed to each member at the address for such member appearing on the rec­ords of the credit union, not more than thirty nor less than seven days prior to such date. The membership shall be given the opportunity to vote by mail ballot. If the proposition is approved by the membership, prompt and reasonable notice of insurance conversion shall be given to all members.




(3)
 In the event of a conversion of a credit union from status as an insured credit union under this chapter as provided under subsection (a)(2) of this section, premium charges payable under 
section 1782(c) of this title
 shall be reduced by an amount proportionate to the number of calendar months for which the converting credit union will no longer be insured under this chapter. As long as a converting credit union remains insured under this chapter, it shall remain subject to all of the provisions of this subchapter.




(e)
 Opinion of Board as to unsound condition of credit union; notice of charges; hearing; order to cease and desist; judicial review
(1)
 If, in the opinion of the Board, any insured credit union, credit union which has insured accounts, or any institution-affiliated party is engaging or has engaged, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to engage, in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting the business of such credit union, or is violating or has violated, or the Board has reasonable cause to believe that the credit union or any institution-affiliated party is about to violate, a law, rule, or regulation, or any condition imposed in writing by the Board in connection with the granting of any application or other request by the credit union or any written agreement entered into with the Board, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or such party a notice of charges in respect thereof. The notice shall contain a statement of the facts constituting the alleged violation or violations or the unsafe or unsound practice or practices, and shall fix a time and place at which a hearing will be held to determine whether an order to cease and desist therefrom should issue against the credit union or the institution-affiliated party. Such hearing shall be fixed for a date not earlier than thirty days nor later than sixty days after service of such notice unless an earlier or a later date is set by the Board at the request of any party so served. Unless the party or parties so served shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, they shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of the cease-and-desist order. In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the Board shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the Board may issue and serve upon the credit union or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice. Such order may, by provisions which may be mandatory or otherwise, require the credit union or its institution-affiliated parties to cease and desist from the same, and, further, to take affirmative action to correct the conditions resulting from any such violation or practice.




(2)
 A cease-and-desist order shall become effective at the expiration of thirty days after the service of such order upon the credit union or other person concerned (except in the case of a cease-and-desist order issued upon consent, which shall become effective at the time specified therein), and shall remain effective and enforceable as provided therein, except to such extent as it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the Board or a reviewing court.

Such order may include any requirement authorized under subsection (e)(3) of this section. Such order shall become effective upon service upon the credit union or such institution-affiliated party and, unless set aside, limited, or suspended by a court in proceedings authorized by paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall remain effective and enforceable pending the completion of the administrative proceedings pursuant to such notice and until such time as the Administration shall dismiss the charges specified in such notice, or if a cease-and-desist order is issued against the credit union or such party, until the effective date of such order.

 In general
The Board may prescribe by regulation conditions under which the prior notice requirement of subsection (a) of this section may be waived in the event of extraordinary circumstances.

 Credit union employee protection remedy
(a)
 In general
(1)
 Employees of credit unions
No insured credit union may discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (or any person acting pursuant to the request of the employee) provided information to the Board or the Attorney General regarding any possible violation of any law or regulation by the credit union or any director, officer, or employee of the credit union.






(2)
 Employees of the Administration
The Administration may not discharge or otherwise discriminate against any employee (including any employee of the National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility) with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because the employee (or any person acting pursuant to the request of the employee) provided information to the Administration or the Attorney General regarding any possible violation of any law or regulation by—
(A)
 any credit union or the Administration;




(B)
 any director, officer, committee member, or employee of any credit union; or

 Insured credit unions

 consistent with this section; and




(ii)
 comparable to section 1831
o
 of this title.






(B)
 Cooperative character of credit unions
The Board shall design the system required under subparagraph (A) to take into account that credit unions are not-for-profit cooperatives that—
(i)
 do not issue capital stock;




(ii)
 must rely on retained earnings to build net worth; and

 have boards of directors that consist primarily of volunteers.








(2)
 New credit unions
(A)
 In general
In addition to regulations under paragraph (1), the Board shall, by regulation, prescribe a system of prompt corrective action that shall apply to new credit unions in lieu of this section and the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1).






(B)
 Criteria for alternative system
The Board shall design the system prescribed under subparagraph (A)—
(i)
 to carry out the purpose of this section;




(ii)
 to recognize that credit unions (as cooperatives that do not issue capital stock) initially have no net worth, and give new credit unions reasonable time to accumulate net worth;




(iii)
 to create adequate incentives for new credit unions to become adequately capitalized by the time that they either—
(I)
 have been in operation for more than 10 years; or




(II)
 have more than $10,000,000 in total assets;






(iv)
 to impose appropriate restrictions and requirements on new credit unions that do not make sufficient progress toward becoming adequately capitalized; and




(v)
 to prevent evasion of the purpose of this section.








(c)
 Net worth categories
(1)
 In general
For purposes of this section the following definitions shall apply:
(A)
 Well capitalized
An insured credit union is “well capitalized” if—
(i)
 it has a net worth ratio of not less than 7 percent; and

 it has a net worth ratio of not less than 6 percent; and




(ii)
 it meets any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d) of this section.






(C)
 Undercapitalized
An insured credit union is “undercapitalized” if—
(i)
 it has a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent; or




(ii)
 it fails to meet any applicable risk-based net worth requirement under subsection (d) of this section.






(D)
 Significantly undercapitalized
An insured credit union is “significantly undercapitalized”—
(i)
 if it has a net worth ratio of less than 4 percent; or




(ii)
 if—
(I)
 it has a net worth ratio of less than 5 percent; and




(II)
 it—
(aa)
 fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under subsection (f) of this section; or




(bb)
 materially fails to implement a net worth restoration plan accepted by the Board.










(E)
 Critically undercapitalized
An insured credit union is “critically undercapitalized” if it has a net worth ratio of less than 2 percent (or such higher net worth ratio, not to exceed 3 percent, as the Board may specify by regulation).








(2)
 Adjusting net worth levels
(A)
 In general
If, for purposes of section 1831
o
(c) of this title, the Federal banking agencies increase or decrease the required minimum level for the leverage limit (as those terms are used in section 1831
o
 of this title), the Board may, by regulation, and subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, correspondingly increase or decrease 1 or more of the net worth ratios specified in subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1) of this subsection in an amount that is equal to not more than the difference between the required minimum level most recently established by the Federal banking agencies and 4 percent of total assets (with respect to institutions regulated by those agencies).






(B)
 Determinations required
The Board may increase or decrease net worth ratios under subparagraph (A) only if the Board—
(i)
 determines, in consultation with the Federal banking agencies, that the reason for the increase or decrease in the required minimum level for the leverage limit also justifies the adjustment in net worth ratios; and




(ii)
 determines that the resulting net worth ratios are sufficient to carry out the purpose of this section.






(C)
 Transition period required
If the Board increases any net worth ratio under this paragraph, the Board shall give insured credit unions a reasonable period of time to meet the increased ratio.








(d)
 Risk-based net worth requirement for complex credit unions
(1)
 In general
The regulations required under subsection (b)(1) of this section shall include a risk-based net worth requirement for insured credit unions that are complex, as defined by the Board based on the portfolios of assets and liabilities of credit unions.






(2)
 Standard
The Board shall design the risk-based net worth requirement to take account of any material risks against which the net worth ratio required for an insured credit union to be adequately capitalized may not provide adequate protection.






(e)
 Earnings-retention requirement applicable to credit unions that are not well capitalized
(1)
 In general
An insured credit union that is not well capitalized shall annually set aside as net worth an amount equal to not less than 0.4 percent of its total assets.






(2)
 Board’s authority to decrease earnings-retention requirement
(A)
 In general
The Board may, by order, decrease the 0.4 percent requirement in paragraph (1) with respect to a credit union to the extent that the Board determines that the decrease—

 would further the purpose of this section.






(B)
 Periodic review required
The Board shall periodically review any order issued under subparagraph (A).

(3)
 Deadlines for submission and review of plans
The Board shall, by regulation, establish deadlines for submission of net worth restoration plans under this subsection that—

 provide insured credit unions with reasonable time to submit net worth restoration plans; and




(B)
 require the Board to act on net worth restoration plans expeditiously.






(4)
 Failure to submit acceptable plan within time allowed
(A)

If an insured credit union fails to submit a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), the Board shall—
(i)
 promptly notify the credit union of that failure; and




(ii)
 give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a net worth restoration plan.






(B)
 Submission of unacceptable plan
If an insured credit union submits a net worth restoration plan within the time allowed under paragraph (3), and the Board determines that the plan is not acceptable, the Board shall—
(i)
 promptly notify the credit union of why the plan is not acceptable; and




(ii)
 give the credit union a reasonable opportunity to submit a revised plan.

 Accepting plan
The Board may accept a net worth restoration plan only if the Board determines that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the net worth of the credit union.






(g)
 Restrictions on undercapitalized credit unions
(1)
 Restriction on asset growth
An insured credit union that is undercapitalized shall not generally permit its average total assets to increase, unless—
(A)
 the Board has accepted the net worth restoration plan of the credit union for that action;

(C)
 the net worth ratio of the credit union increases at a rate that is consistent with the net worth restoration plan.

(2)
 the Board may not delegate its authority to reclassify an insured credit union into a lower net worth category or to treat an insured credit union as if it were in a lower net worth category.

section 1782 of this title
.






(e)
 Distributions from Insurance Fund
At the end of any calendar year in which the Stabilization Fund has an outstanding advance from the Treasury, the Insurance Fund is prohibited from making the distribution to insured credit unions described in 
section 1782(c)(3) of this title
. In lieu of the distribution described in that section, the Insurance Fund shall make a distribution to the Stabilization Fund of the maximum amount possible that does not reduce the Insurance Fund’s equity ratio below the normal operating level and does not reduce the Insurance Fund’s available assets ratio below 1.0 percent.




(f)
 Investment of Stabilization Fund assets
The Board may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Stabilization Fund as is not, in the Board’s judgment, required to meet the current needs of the Stabilization Fund. Such investments shall be made by the Secretary of the Treasury in public debt securities, with maturities suitable to the needs of the Stabilization Fund, as determined by the Board, and bearing interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration current market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturity.




(g)
 Reports
The Board shall submit an annual report to Congress on the financial condition and the results of the operation of the Stabilization Fund. The report is due to Congress within 30 days after each anniversary of the first advance made under subsection (c)(1). Because the Fund will use advances from the Treasury to meet corporate stabilization costs with full repayment of borrowings to Treasury at the Board’s discretion not due until 7 years from the initial advance, to the extent operating expenses of the Fund exceed income, the financial condition of the Fund may reflect a deficit. With planned and required future repayments, the Board shall resolve all deficits prior to termination of the Fund.




(h)
 Closing of Stabilization Fund
Within 90 days following the seventh anniversary of the initial Stabilization Fund advance, or earlier at the Board’s discretion, the Board shall distribute any funds, property, or other assets remaining in the Stabilization Fund to the Insurance Fund and shall close the Stabilization Fund. If the Board extends the final repayment date as permitted under subsection (c)(3), the mandatory date for closing the Stabilization Fund shall be extended by the same number of days.




 Congressional findings
The Congress finds that the establishment of a National Credit Union Central Liquidity Facility is needed to improve general financial stability by meeting the liquidity needs of credit unions and thereby encourage savings, support consumer and mortgage lending, and provide basic financial resources to all segments of the economy.
