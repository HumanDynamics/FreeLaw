 National Institute of Building Sciences
(a)
 Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
(1)
 The Congress finds (A) that the lack of an authoritative national source to make findings and to advise both the public and private sectors of the economy with respect to the use of building science and technology in achieving nationally acceptable standards and other technical provision for use in Federal, State, and local housing and building regulations is an obstacle to efforts by and imposes severe burdens upon all those who procure, design, construct, use, operate, maintain, and retire physical facilities, and frequently results in the failure to take full advantage of new and useful developments in technology which could improve our living environment; (B) that the establishment of model buildings codes or of a single national building code will not completely resolve the problem because of the difficulty at all levels of government in updating their housing and building regulations to reflect new developments in technology, as well as the irregularities and inconsistencies which arise in applying such requirements to particular localities or special local conditions; (C) that the lack of uniform housing and building regulatory provisions increases the costs of construction and thereby reduces the amount of housing and other community facilities which can be provided; and (D) that the existence of a single authoritative nationally recognized institution to provide for the evaluation of new technology could facilitate introduction of such innovations and their acceptance at the Federal, State, and local levels.




(2)
 The Congress further finds, however, that while an authoritative source of technical findings is needed, various private organizations and institutions, private industry, labor, and Federal and other governmental agencies and entities are presently engaged in building research, technology development, testing, and evaluation, standards and model code development and promulgation, and information dissemination. These existing activities should be encouraged and these capabilities effectively utilized wherever possible and appropriate to the purposes of this section.




(3)
 The Congress declares that an authoritative nongovernmental instrument needs to be created to address the problems and issues described in paragraph (1), that the creation of such an instrument should be initiated by the Government, with the advice and assistance of the National Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Engineering-National Research Council (hereinafter referred to as the “Academies-Research Council”) and of the various sectors of the building community, including labor and management, technical experts in building science and technology, and the various levels of government.




(b)
 Establishment; advice and assistance of Academies-Research Council and other agencies and organizations knowledgeable in building technology
(1)
 There is authorized to be established, for the purposes described in subsection (a)(3) of this section, an appropriate nonprofit, non­governmental instrument to be known as the National Institute of Building Sciences (hereinafter referred to as the “Institute”), which shall not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government. The Institute shall be subject to the provisions of this section and, to the extent consistent with this section, to a charter of the Congress if such a charter is requested and issued or to the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act if that is deemed preferable.




(2)
 The Academies-Research Council, along with other agencies and organizations which are knowledgeable in the field of building technology, shall advise and assist in (A) the establishment of the Institute; (B) the development of an organizational framework to encourage and provide for the maximum feasible participation of public and private scientific, technical, and financial organizations, institutions, and agencies now engaged in activities pertinent to the development, promulgation, and maintenance of performance criteria, standards, and other technical provisions for building codes and other regulations; and (C) the promulgation of appropriate organizational rules and procedures including those for the selection and operation of a technical staff, such rules and procedures to be based upon the primary object of promoting the public interest and insuring that the widest possible variety of interests and experience essential to the functions of the Institute are represented in the Institute’s operations. Recommendations of the Academies-Research Council shall be based upon consultations with and recommendations from various private organizations and institutions, labor, private industry, and governmental agencies entities operating in the field, and the Consultative Council as provided for under subsection (c)(8) of this section.




(3)
 Nothing in this section shall be construed as expressing the intent of the Congress that the Academies-Research Council itself be required to assume any function or operation vested in the Institute by or under this section.

 Funds for housing for elderly and persons with disabilities available for cost of maintenance and disposal of such properties
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for this fiscal year and every fiscal year thereafter, funds appropriated for housing for the elderly, as authorized by 
 Congressional findings respecting housing for senior citizens
The Congress finds that there is a large and growing need for suitable housing for older people both in urban and rural areas. Our older citizens face special problems in meeting their housing needs because of the prevalence of modest and limited incomes among the elderly, their difficulty in obtaining liberal long-term home mortgage credit, and their need for housing planned and designed to include features necessary to the safety and convenience of the occupants in a suitable neighborhood environment. The Congress further finds that the present programs for housing the elderly under the Department of Housing and Urban Development have proven the value of Federal credit assistance in this field and at the same time demonstrated the urgent need for an expanded and more comprehensive effort to meet our responsibilities to our senior citizens.

“(a)
 The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the Department of Health and Human Services spends in excess of $5,000,000,000 annually for housing in the form of allowances for shelter for public assistance recipients;




“(2)
 States administering the Department of Health and Human Services public assistance program often specify shelter allowances that have little relationship to the cost or the quality of the housing in which public assistance recipients live;




“(3)
 at least 30 per centum of public assistance recipients live in substandard housing;




“(4)
 the older rental buildings in which many public assistance recipients live are in those neighborhoods that need the assistance of the programs of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for preservation and rehabilitation; and




“(5)
 there is the potential for improving housing for many lower income families by coordinating State and local government efforts in order to assure that families receiving public assistance payments from the Department of Health and Human Services are able to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing.




“(b)
 The purpose of this section, therefore, is to provide assistance to units of general local government and their designated agencies in order to develop a program that will—
“(1)
 encourage the upgrading of housing occupied primarily by lower income families, including families receiving assistance under the aid for families with dependent children program established under title IV of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 601
 et seq.]; and




“(2)
 provide for better coordination at the local level of the efforts to assist families receiving public assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services so that these families will be able to occupy affordable housing that is decent, safe, and sanitary and that, if necessary, is rehabilitated with funds provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.




“(c)
 The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereafter referred to in this section as the ‘Secretary’) shall, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, establish and maintain a demonstration project to carry out the purpose described in subsection (b).

(1)
 Grants may be made to States and units of general local government and agencies thereof that apply for them in a manner and at a time determined by the Secretary and that, in the case of units of general local government and their agencies, are selected on the basis of an administrative plan described in such application.




“(2)
 No such administrative plan shall be selected by the Secretary unless it sets forth a plan for local government activities that are designed to—
“(A)
 require or encourage owners of rental housing occupied by lower income families to bring such housing into compliance with local housing codes;




“(B)
 provide technical assistance, loans, or grants to assist owners described in subparagraph (A) to undertake cost-effective improvements of such housing;




“(C)
 work with the State to establish and implement a schedule of local shelter allowances for recipients of assistance under title IV of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 601
 et seq.] based on building quality that will be applicable to buildings involved in this program; and




“(D)
 coordinate local housing inspection, housing rehabilitation loan or grant assistance, rental assistance, and social service programs for the purpose of improving the quality and affordability of housing for lower income families.






“(3)
 Funds received from any grant made by the Secretary to a unit of general local government shall be made available for use according to the administrative plans and may be used for—
“(A)
 technical assistance or financial assistance to property owners to upgrade housing projects described in paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection;




“(B)
 temporary rental assistance to families who live in buildings assisted under this program and who are eligible for, but are not receiving, assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437f
], except that such families shall not include families receiving assistance under title IV of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 601
 et seq.], and the amount of such rental assistance may not exceed 20 per centum of each grant received under this section;




“(C)
 housing counseling and referral and other housing related services;




“(D)
 expenses incurred in administering the program carried out with funds received under this section, except that such expenses may not exceed 10 per centum of the grant received under this section; and




“(E)
 other appropriate activities that are consistent with the purposes of this section and that are approved by the Secretary.






“(f)
 Any recipient of a grant from the Secretary under this section shall agree to—
“(1)
 contribute to the program an amount equal to 15 per centum of the funds received from the Secretary under this section, and the Secretary shall permit the recipient to meet this requirement by the contribution of the value of services carried out specifically in connection with the program assisted under this section;




“(2)
 permit the Secretary and the General Accounting Office [now Government Accountability Office] to audit its books in order to assure that the funds received under this section are used in accordance with the section; and




“(3)
 other terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary for the purpose of carrying out this section in an effective and efficient manner.




“(g)
 In making grants available under this section, the Secretary shall select as recipients at least 20 units of general local government (or their designated agencies). The selection of proposals for funding shall be based on criteria that result in a selection of projects that will enable the Secretary to carry out the purpose of this section in an effective and efficient manner and provide a sufficient amount of data necessary to make an evaluation of the demonstration project carried out under this section.


“(h)
(1)
 Not later than 
June 1, 1984
, the Secretary shall transmit to the Congress an interim report on the implementation of the demonstration under this section.




“(2)
 The Secretary shall transmit, not later than 
October 1, 1985
, to both Houses of the Congress a detailed report concerning the findings and conclusions that have been reached by the Secretary as a result of carrying out this section, along with any legislative recommendations that the Secretary determines are necessary.




“(i)
 To carry out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $10,000,000 during fiscal year 1984, and not to exceed $15,000,000 during fiscal year 1985, to remain available until expended.”


“(a)
 This section may be cited as the ‘Public Housing Anti-Crime Amendments of 1980’.


“(b)
 The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 public housing and surrounding neighborhoods continue to suffer substantially from rising crime and the fear of crime;




“(2)
 funding to provide more security for public housing can be used to leverage funding from other sources and thereby produce more successful anti-crime efforts;




“(3)
 the effects of inflation and the need for reductions in the budget of the Federal Government result in a need for more co-targeting of Federal and local anti-crime resources;




“(4)
 as authorized by the Public Housing Security Demonstration Act of 1978 [set out below], the Urban Initiatives Anti-Crime Program has performed in a promising manner; and




“(5)
 the First Annual Report to Congress of the Urban Initiatives Anti-Crime Program and the two General Accounting Office [now Government Accountability Office] reports to Congress on such Program have provided useful suggestions which can now be implemented.




“(c)
 It is, therefore, the purpose of this section to continue the efforts of the Urban Initiatives Anti-Crime Program so that more progress can be made in providing secure, decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling units for low-income and elderly tenants in public housing projects.

“(b)
(1)
 The Congress finds that—
“(A)
 low-income and elderly public housing residents of the Nation have suffered substantially from rising crime and violence, and are being threatened as a result of inadequate security arrangements for the prevention of physical violence, theft, burglary, and other crimes;




“(B)
 older persons generally regard the fear of crime as the most serious problem in their lives, to the extent that one-fourth of all Americans over 65 voluntarily restrict their mobility because of it;




“(C)
 crime and the fear of crime have led some residents to move from public housing projects;




“(D)
 an integral part of successfully providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for low-income persons is to insure that the housing is secure;




“(E)
 local public housing authorities may have inadequate security arrangements for the prevention of crime and vandalism; and




“(F)
 action is needed to provide for the security of public housing residents and to preserve the Nation’s investment in its public housing stock.






“(2)
 It is, therefore, declared to be the policy of the United States to provide for a demonstration and evaluation of effective means of mitigating crime and vandalism in public housing projects, in order to provide a safe living environment for the residents, particularly the elderly residents, of such projects.




“(c)
(1)
 The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall promptly initiate and carry out during the fiscal year beginning on 
October 1, 1978
, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, a program for the development, demonstration, and evaluation of improved, innovative community anticrime and security methods, concepts and techniques which will mitigate the level of crime in public housing projects and their surrounding neighborhoods.




“(2)
 In selecting public housing projects to receive assistance under this section, the Secretary shall assure that a broad spectrum of project types, locations and tenant populations are represented and shall consider at least the following: the extent of crime and vandalism currently existing in the projects; the extent, nature and quality of community anticrime efforts in the projects and surrounding areas; the extent, nature and quality of police and other protective services available to the projects and their tenants; the demand for public housing units in the locality, the vacancy rate, and extent of abandonment of such units; and the characteristics and needs of the public housing tenants.




“(3)
 In selecting the anticrime and security methods, concepts and techniques to be demonstrated under this section, the Secretary shall consider the improvement of physical security equipment or dwelling units in those projects, social and environmental design improvements, tenant awareness and volunteer programs, tenant participation and employment in providing security services, and such other measures as deemed necessary or appropriate by the Secretary. Particular attention shall be given to comprehensive community anticrime and security plans submitted by public housing authorities which (i) provide for coordination between public housing management and local law enforcement officials, or (ii) coordinate resources available to the community through programs funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Community Services Administration, and the Corporation for National and Community Service, or other Federal or State agencies.




“(4)
 In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Secretary shall coordinate and jointly target resources with other agencies, particularly the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Education, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Community Services Administration, and State and local agencies.




“(5)
 In order to assess the impact of crime and vandalism in public housing projects, the Secretary may, as part of the Annual Housing Survey conducted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or by other means, collect data on crime and vandalism and integrate the data collection with the victimization surveys undertaken by the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce.




“(6)
 The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize information derived from the program authorized by this section for assisting in establishing (A) guidelines to be used by public housing authorities in determining strategies to meet the security needs of tenants of public housing projects assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437
 et seq.] other than under section 8 of such Act [
42 U.S.C. 1437f
], and (B) guidelines for improvements relating to the security of projects (and the tenants living in such projects) assisted under section 14 of such Act [
42 U.S.C. 1437
l
].




“(d)
 The Secretary shall initiate and carry out a survey of crime and vandalism existing in the Nation’s public housing projects. The survey shall include the nature, extent and impact of crime and vandalism and the nature and extent of resources currently available and employed to alleviate crime and vandalism in public housing.


“(e)
 The Secretary shall report to the Congress not later than eighteen months after the date of enactment of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1980 [
Oct. 8, 1980
]. Such report shall include the results of the survey on crime and vandalism in public housing; findings from the demonstration and evaluation of various methods of reducing the level of crime; and legislative recommendations, if appropriate for (A) a comprehensive program to increase security in public housing projects and (B) increasing the coordination between anticrime programs of other State and Federal agencies that may be used by public housing authorities. Any recommendations shall include estimated costs of such programs.


“(f)
 Of the additional authority approved in appropriation Acts with respect to entering into annual contributions contracts under section 5(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437c(c)
] for the fiscal year beginning on 
October 1, 1978
, the Secretary may utilize up to $12,000,000 of such authority in the fiscal year beginning on 
October 1, 1978
, for the establishment of the public housing security demonstration program authorized by this section. Of the authority approved in appropriation Acts for the purpose of entering into annual contributions contracts under section 5(c) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 with respect to the fiscal year beginning on 
October 1, 1980
, the Secretary may enter into contracts to carry out this section, except that the aggregate amount obligated over the duration of such contracts may not exceed $10,000,000.”

 Insurance of financial institutions
(a)
 Authority to insure financial institutions
The Secretary is authorized and empowered upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure banks, trust companies, personal finance companies, mortgage companies, building and loan associations, installment lending companies and other such financial institutions, which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities and approves as eligible for credit insurance, against losses which they may sustain as a result of loans and advances of credit, and purchases of obligations representing loans and advances of credit, made by them for the purpose of (i) financing alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures or manufactured homes, and the building of new structures, upon urban, suburban, or rural real property (including the restoration, rehabilitation, rebuilding, and replacement of such improvements which have been damaged or destroyed by earthquake, conflagration, tornado, hurricane, cyclone, flood, or other catastrophe), by the owners thereof or by lessees of such real property under a lease expiring not less than six months after the maturity of the loan or advance of credit; and for the purpose of (ii) financing the purchase of a manufactured home to be used by the owner as his principal residence or financing the purchase of a lot on which to place such home and paying expenses reasonably necessary for the appropriate preparation of such lot, including the installation of utility connections, sanitary facilities, and paving, and the construction of a suitable pad, or financing only the acquisition of such a lot either with or without such preparation by an owner of a manufactured home; and for the purpose of financing the preservation of historic structures, and, as used in this section, the term “historic structures” means residential structures which are registered in the National Register of Historic Places or which are certified by the Secretary of the Interior to conform to National Register criteria; and the term “preservation” means restoration or rehabilitation undertaken for such purposes as are approved by the Secretary in regulations issued by him, after consulting with the Secretary of the Interior. Other than in connection with a manufactured home or a lot on which to place such a home (or both), in no case shall the insurance granted by the Secretary under this section to any such financial institution on loans, advances of credit, and purchases made by such financial institution for such purposes exceed 10 per centum of the total amount of such loans, advances of credit, and purchases. With respect to any loan, advance of credit, or purchase, the amount of any claim for loss on any such individual loan, advance of credit or purchase paid by the Secretary under the provisions of this section to a lending institution shall not exceed 90 per centum of such loss.


After 
August 2, 1954
, (i) the Secretary shall not enter into contracts for insurance pursuant to this section except with lending institutions which are subject to the inspection and supervision of a governmental agency required by law to make periodic examinations of their books and accounts, and which the Secretary finds to be qualified by experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases, and with such other lending institutions which the Secretary approves as eligible for insurance pursuant to this section on the basis of their credit and their experience or facilities to make and service such loans, advances or purchases; (ii) only such items as substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of properties shall be eligible for financing under this section, and therefore the Secretary shall from time to time declare ineligible for financing under this section any item, product, alteration, repair, improvement, or class thereof which he determines would not substantially protect or improve the basic livability or utility of such properties, and he may also declare ineligible for financing under this section any item which he determines is especially subject to selling abuses; and (iii) the Secretary is authorized and directed, by such regulations or procedures as he shall deem advisable, to prevent the use of any financial assistance under this section (1) with respect to new residential structures (other than manufactured homes) that have not been completed and occupied for at least six months, or (2) which would, through multiple loans, result in an outstanding aggregate loan balance with respect to the same structure exceeding the dollar amount limitation prescribed in this subsection for the type of loan involved: 
Provided
, That this clause (iii) may in the discretion of the Secretary be waived with respect to the period of occupancy or completion of any such new residential structures. The Secretary is hereby authorized and directed, with respect to manufactured homes to be financed under this section, to (i) prescribe minimum property standards to assure the livability and durability of the manufactured home and the suitability of the site on which the manufactured home is to be located; and (ii) obtain assurances from the borrower that the manufactured home will be placed on a site which complies with the standards prescribed by the Secretary and with local zoning and other applicable local requirements.


The insurance authority provided under this section may be made available with respect to any existing manufactured home that has not been insured under this section if such home was constructed in accordance with the standards issued under the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 [
42 U.S.C. 5401
 et seq.] and it meets standards similar to the minimum property standards applicable to existing homes insured under subchapter II of this chapter.


Alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures may include the provision of fire safety equipment, energy conserving improvements, or the installation of solar energy systems. Alterations, repairs, and improvements upon or in connection with existing structures may also include the evaluation and reduction of lead-based paint hazards. As used in this section—
(1)
 the term “fire safety equipment” means any device or facility which is designed to reduce the risk of personal injury or property damage resulting from fire and is in conformity with such criteria and standards as shall be prescribed by the Secretary;




(2)
 the term “energy conserving improvements” means the purchase and installation of weatherization materials as defined in 
section 6862(9) of title 42
; and 
1

 So in original. The word “and” probably should not appear.




(3)
 the term “solar energy system” means any addition, alteration, or improvement to an existing or new structure which is designed to utilize wind energy or solar energy either of the active type based on mechanically forced energy transfer or of the passive type based on convective, conductive, or radiant energy transfer or some combination of these types to reduce the energy requirements of that structure from other energy sources, and which is in conformity with such criteria and standards as shall be prescribed by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Energy.

 So in original. The period probably should be “; and”.




(4)
 the terms “evaluation”, “reduction”, and “lead-based paint hazard” have the same meanings given those terms in 
section 4851b of title 42
.




(b)

1




(E)
 $23,226 if made for the purpose of financing the purchase, by an owner of a manufactured home which is the principal residence of that owner, of a suitably developed lot on which to place that manufactured home, and if the owner certifies that he or she will place the manufactured home on the lot acquired with such loan within 6 months after the date of such loan.

(G)
 such principal amount as the Secretary may prescribe if made for the purpose of financing fire safety equipment for a nursing home, extended health care facility, intermediate health care facility, or other comparable health care facility.

Any such obligation with respect to which insurance is granted under this section shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the financial institution.




(6)
(A)

No insurance shall be granted under this section to any such financial institution with respect to any obligation representing any such loan, advance of credit, or purchase by it, made for the purposes of financing a manufactured home which is intended to be situated in a manufactured home community pursuant to a lease, unless such lease—
(A)
 expires not less than 3 years after the origination date of the obligation;




(B)

 Authority of Secretary
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may—
(A)
 deal with, complete, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, or assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of, for cash or credit in the Secretary’s discretion, and upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as the Secretary shall determine to be reasonable, any real or personal property conveyed to or otherwise acquired by the Secretary, in connection with the payment of insurance heretofore or hereafter granted under this subchapter, including any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by him in connection with the payment of insurance heretofore or hereafter granted under this section; and

 Insurance of mortgages
(a)
 Supplemental system; limitation on amount; termination of authority
To assist in providing adequate housing for families of low and moderate income, particularly in suburban and outlying areas, this section is designed to supplement systems of mortgage insurance under other provisions of this chapter by making feasible the insurance of mortgages covering properties in areas where it is not practicable to obtain conformity with many of the requirements essential to the insurance of mortgages on housing in built-up urban areas. The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure, as hereinafter provided, any mortgage (as defined in 
section 1707 of this title
) offered to him which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: 
Provided
, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this section and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000, except that with the approval of the President such aggregate amount may be increased at any time or times by additional amounts aggregating not more than $150,000,000 upon a determination by the President, taking into account the general effect of any such increase upon conditions in the building industry and upon the national economy, that such increase is in the public interest: 
And provided further
, That no mortgage shall be insured under this section after 
August 2, 1954
, except pursuant to a commitment to insure issued on or before such date.




(b)
 Eligibility conditions
To be eligible for insurance under this section, a mortgage shall—
(1)
 have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;




(2)
 involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed $5,700, and not to exceed 95 per centum of the appraised value, as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance, of a property upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for a single-family residence, and which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction: 
Provided
, That the mortgagor shall be the owner and occupant of the property at the time of insurance and shall have paid on account of the property at least 5 per centum of the Secretary’s estimate of the cost of acquisition in cash or its equivalent, or shall be the builder constructing the dwelling, in which case the principal obligation shall not exceed 85 per centum of the appraised value of the property or $5,100: 
Provided further
, That the Secretary finds that the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing for families of low and moderate income particularly in suburban and outlying areas: 
And provided further
, That, where the mortgagor is the owner and occupant of the property and establishes (to the satisfaction of the Secretary) that his home, which he occupied as an owner or as a tenant, was destroyed or damaged to such an extent that reconstruction is required as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm or other catastrophe, which the President, pursuant to sections 5122(2) and 5170 of title 42, has determined to be a major disaster, such maximum dollar limitation may be increased by the Secretary from $5,700 to $7,000, and the percentage limitation may be increased by the Secretary from 95 per centum to 100 per centum of the appraised value;




(3)
 have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed thirty years from the date of insurance of the mortgage;




(4)
 contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary requiring periodic payments by the mortgagor not in excess of his reasonable ability to pay as determined by the Secretary;




(5)
 bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance and service charges, if any) at not to exceed 5 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;




(6)
 provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, for the application of the mortgagor’s periodic payments (exclusive of the amount allocated to interest and to the premium charge which is required for mortgage insurance as hereinafter provided and to the service charge, if any) to amortization of the principal of the mortgage; and




(7)
 contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, service charges, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.




(c)
 Premium charge
The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this section, but in the case of any mortgage, such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1 per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this section at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: 
Provided
, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this section, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this section is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized, in his discretion, to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid.




(d)
 Release of mortgagor
The Secretary may, at any time under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage.




(e)
 Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility
Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this section shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.




(f)
 Rights of mortgagee upon foreclosure
In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under this section shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property in accordance with the regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in 
section 1710(a) of this title

 1715z–12, 1715z–16, 1715z–17, or 1715z–18 of this title, or any other financing mechanism providing alternative methods for repayment of a mortgage that is determined by the Secretary to involve additional risk, or (2) under subsection (n) of this section are not required to be the same as the premium charges for mortgages insured under the other provisions of this section, but in no case shall premium charges under subsection (n) of this section exceed 1 per centum per annum: 
Provided
, That any reduced premium charge so fixed and computed may, in the discretion of the Secretary, also be made applicable in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe to each insured mortgage outstanding under the section or sections involved at the time the reduced premium charge is fixed. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary:

Provided
, That with respect to mortgages (1) for which the Secretary requires, at the time the mortgage is insured, the payment of a single premium charge to cover the total premium obligation for the insurance of the mortgage, and (2) on which the principal obligation is paid before the number of years on which the premium with respect to a particular mortgage was based, or the property is sold subject to the mortgage or is sold and the mortgage is assumed prior to such time, the Secretary shall provide for refunds, where appropriate, of a portion of the premium paid and shall provide for appropriate allocation of the premium cost among the mortgagors over the term of the mortgage, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary which take into account sound financial and actuarial considerations.




(2)

(A)
 The Secretary shall establish and collect, at the time of insurance, a single premium payment in an amount not exceeding 3 percent of the amount of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage.

(B)

(C)
(i)

(ii)
(I)
 Subject to subclause (II), with respect to a mortgage, the amount described in this clause is 10 basis points of the remaining insured principal balance (excluding the portion of the remaining balance attributable to the premium collected under subparagraph (A) and without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments).

Provided
, That debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after

section 1713 of this title
 prior to 
February 3, 1938

 Certificate of claim
(1)
 Subject to paragraph (2), the certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, at the time of the conveyance to the Secretary of the property covered by the mortgage, the mortgagor had redeemed the property and paid in full all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. The amount to which the holder of any such certificate shall be entitled shall be determined as provided in subsection (f) of this section.

(i)
 If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property if the mortgage was insured under 
section 1709 of this title
: 
Provided
, That on and after 
September 2, 1964
, any excess remaining after payment to the holder of the full amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest increment thereon, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund; and




(ii)
 If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.






(2)
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to commitments for insurance issued after 
August 11, 1955
, and, with the consent of the mortgagee or mortgagor, as the case may be, with respect to mortgages insured pursuant to commitments issued prior to such date, to effect the settlement of certificates of claim and refunds to mortgagors at any time after the sale or transfer of title to the property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and without awaiting the final liquidation of such property for the purpose of determining the net amount to be realized therefrom: 
Provided
, That the settlement authority created by the Housing Amendments of 1955 shall be terminated with respect to any certificates of claim outstanding as of 
September 2, 1964

September 2, 1964
, by making payment in cash to the holder thereof of such amount not exceeding the face amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest thereon, as the Secretary may consider appropriate: 
Provided
, That in any case where the certificate of claim is settled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, any amounts realized after 
September 2, 1964
, in the liquidation of the Secretary’s interest in the property, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund.

Provided
, That nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the Secretary from delegating such power by order or by power of attorney, in his discretion, to any officer, agent, or employee he may appoint: 
And provided further
, That a conveyance or transfer of title to real or personal property or an interest therein to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, his successors and assigns, without identifying the Secretary therein, shall be deemed a proper conveyance or transfer to the same extent and of like effect as if the Secretary were personally named in such conveyance or transfer.

Provided
, That this limitation shall not apply to mortgages on housing in Alaska or in Guam, but such a mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the value of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the land, the proposed physical improvements, utilities within the boundaries of the property or project, architect’s fees, taxes, and interest accruing during construction, and other miscellaneous charges incident to construction and approved by the Secretary): 
And provided further
, That nothing contained in this section shall preclude the insurance of mortgages covering existing construction located in slum or blighted areas, as defined in paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section, and the Secretary may require such repair or rehabilitation work to be completed as is, in his discretion, necessary to remove conditions detrimental to safety, health, or morals; and

 of this title (as such section existed immediately before 
November 30, 1983
) is involved. Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the amount which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of

Provided
, That such charges for appraisal and inspection shall not aggregate more than 1 per centum of the original principal face amount of the mortgage.




(e)
 Adjusted premium charge on payment of mortgage
In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this section is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until such maturity date.

 Payment of insurance after default
The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this section shall be considered a default under such mortgage and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interests arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loans not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transactions. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (h) of this section, and debentures having a par value equal to the original principal face amount of the mortgage plus such amount as the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default, less the sum of (i) that part of the amount of the principal obligation that has been repaid by the mortgagor, (ii) an amount equivalent to 1 per centum of the unpaid amount of such principal obligation, and (iii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property: 
Provided
, That the mortgagee in the event of a default under the mortgage may, at its option and in accordance with regulations of, and in a period to be determined by, the Secretary, proceed to foreclose on and obtain possession of or otherwise acquire such property from the mortgagor after default, and receive the benefits of the insurance as herein provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of the rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations, and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims that may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as provided in this subsection, except that in such event the 1 per centum deduction, set out in (ii) hereof, shall not apply. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, upon receipt, after 
September 2, 1964

(h)
 Certificate of claim; division of excess proceeds
The certificate of claim issued under this section shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, on the date of the assignment, transfer and delivery to the Secretary provided for in subsection (g) of this section, the mortgagor had extinguished the mortgage indebtedness by payment in full of all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. If the net amount realized from the mortgage, and all claims in connection therewith, so assigned, transferred, and delivered, and from the property covered by such mortgage and all claims in connection with such property, after deducting all expenses incurred by the Secretary in handling, dealing with, acquiring title to, and disposing of such mortgage and property and in collecting such claims, exceeds the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:
(1)
 If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund; and




(2)
 If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.




(i)

l
(g), and 
section 1715x of this title
 may be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned (or the property is conveyed) to the Secretary and shall bear interest from such date. They shall bear interest at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715
o
 of this title payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for mortgages insured after

They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amount so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.




(j)

(1)
 shall be in such form and amounts;

The Secretary at any sale under foreclosure may, in his discretion, for the protection of the General Insurance Fund, bid any sum up to but not in excess of the total unpaid indebtedness secured by the mortgage, plus taxes, insurance, foreclosure costs, fees, and other expenses, and may become the purchaser of the property at such sale. In determining the amount to be bid, the Secretary shall act consistently with the goal established in 
section 1701z–11(a)(1) of this title
. The Secretary is authorized to pay from the General Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to defray such taxes, insurance, costs, fees, and other expenses in connection with the acquisition or foreclosure of property under this section. Pending such acquisition by voluntary conveyance or by foreclosure, the Secretary is authorized, with respect to any mortgage assigned to him under the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, to exercise all the rights of a mortgagee under such mortgage, including the right to sell such mortgage, and to take such action and advance such sums as may be necessary to preserve or protect the lien of such mortgage.




(l)
 Handling and disposal of property; settlement of claims
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of real and other property by the United States, the Secretary shall also have power, for the protection of the interests of the General Insurance Fund, to pay out of the General Insurance Fund all expenses or charges in connection with, and to deal with, complete, reconstruct, rent, renovate, modernize, insure, make contracts for the management of, or establish suitable agencies for the management of, or sell for cash or credit or lease in his discretion, any property acquired by him under this section, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall also have power to pursue to final collection by way of compromise or otherwise all claims assigned and transferred to him in connection with the assignment, transfer, and delivery provided for in this section, and at any time, upon default, to foreclose on any property secured by any mortgage assigned and transferred to or held by him: 
Provided
, That 
section 6101 of title 41
 shall not be construed to apply to any contract for hazard insurance, or to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000.

(B)
 have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed the remaining term of the mortgage; except that, in the case of repairs or improvements to a property covered by an uninsured mortgage dated more than twenty years prior to the date of the commitment to insure, of such magnitude that the Secretary deems them to be a major rehabilitation or modernization of such property, the loan may have a maturity date up to ten years in excess of the remaining term of the uninsured mortgage;




(C)
 be secured in such manner as the Secretary may require;




(D)
 contain such other terms, conditions, and restrictions as the Secretary may prescribe; and

The aggregate net income thereafter received or any net loss thereafter sustained by the Management Fund, in any semiannual period, shall be credited or charged to the General Surplus Account or the Participating Reserve Account or both in such manner and amounts as the Secretary may determine to be in accord with sound actuarial and accounting practice. Upon termination of the insurance obligation of the Management Fund by payment of any mortgage or loan insured under this section, and at such time or times prior to such termination as the Secretary may determine, the Secretary is authorized to distribute to the mortgagor or borrower a share of the Participating Reserve Account in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound actuarial and accounting practice: 
Provided
, That in no event shall the amount of the distributable share exceed the aggregate scheduled annual premiums of the mortgagor or borrower to the year of payment of the share less the total amount of any share or shares previously distributed by the Secretary to the mortgagor or borrower: 
And provided further
, That in no event may a distributable share be distributed until any funds transferred from the General Insurance Fund to the Management Fund pursuant to subsection (
o
) of this section have been repaid in full to the General Insurance Fund. No mortgagor, mortgagee, borrower, or lender shall have any vested right in a credit balance in any such account or be subject to any liability arising out of the mutuality of the Management Fund. The determination of the Secretary as to the amount to be paid by him to any mortgagor or borrower shall be final and conclusive.

August 10, 1965
, under subsection (a)(1), (a)(3) (if the project is acquired by a cooperative corporation), (i), or (j) of this section: 
Provided

(n)
 Payment of premium charges in debentures
Notwithstanding the limitations contained in other provisions of this chapter, premium charges for mortgages or loans the insurance of which is the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund may be payable in debentures issued in connection with mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or in connection with mortgages or loans insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund, as provided in subsection (m) of this section. Premium charges on the insurance of mortgages or loans transferred to the Management Fund or insured pursuant to commitments transferred to the Management Fund may be payable in debentures which are the obligation of either the Management Fund or the General Insurance Fund.




(o)
 Transfer of funds between Management Fund and General Insurance Fund; investment of monies
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter the Secretary is authorized to transfer funds between the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund and the General Insurance Fund in such amounts and at such times as he may determine, taking into consideration the requirements of each such Fund, to assist in carrying out effectively the insurance programs for which such Funds were respectively established. Moneys in the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund not needed for current operations of the fund shall be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States to the credit of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund or invested in bonds or other obligations of, or in bonds or other obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States or any agency of the United States: 
Provided
, That such moneys shall to the maximum extent feasible be invested in such bonds or other obligations the proceeds of which will be used to directly support the residential mortgage market. The Secretary may, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, purchase in the open market debentures which are the obligations of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund. Such purchases shall be made at a price which will provide an investment yield of not less than the yield obtainable from other investments authorized by this subsection.

(p)
 Increase in maximum mortgage amounts for solar energy systems and energy conservation measures
Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the project mortgage amounts which may be insured under this section may be increased by up to 20 per centum if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of 
section 1703(a) of this title
) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)

 Insurance of mortgage where mortgagor is not occupant of property
The Secretary is hereby authorized to insure any mortgage otherwise eligible for insurance under any of the provisions of this chapter without regard to any requirement with respect to the occupancy of the mortgagor of the property at the time of insurance, where the Secretary is satisfied that the inability of the mortgagor to meet such requirement is by reason of his entry on active duty in a uniformed service subsequent to the filing of an application for insurance and the mortgagor expresses an intent to meet such requirement upon his release from active duty.

 The mortgaged property shall be held by—
(A)
 a mortgagor approved by the Secretary, and the Secretary may in his discretion require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to rents or sales, charges, capital structure, rate of return and methods of operation, and for such purpose the Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in any such mortgagor as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulations.

section 1712a of this title
) which are applicable to units with two, three, or four or more bedrooms; (III) the Secretary may, by regulation, increase the dollar amount limitations contained in subparagraph (B)(iii)(I) (as such limitations may have been adjusted in accordance with 
section 1712a of this title
) by not to exceed 170 percent in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require and by not to exceed 170 percent, or 215 percent in high cost areas, where the Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis, but in no case may any such increase exceed 90 percent where the Secretary determines that a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association in implementing its special assistance functions under section 1720

section 1703(a) of this title
) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)

(iv)
 include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems desirable and consistent with the urban renewal plan or, where appropriate, with the locally developed strategy for neighborhood improvement, conservation or preservation: 
Provided
, That the project shall be predominantly residential and any nondwelling facility included in the mortgage shall be found by the Secretary to contribute to the economic feasibility of the project, and the Secretary shall give due consideration to the possible effect of the project on other business enterprises in the community.

 the term “home improvement loan” means a loan, advance of credit, or purchase of an obligation representing a loan or advance of credit made—
(i)
 for the purpose of financing the improvement of an existing structure (or in connection with an existing structure) which was constructed not less than ten years prior to the making of such loan, advance of credit, or purchase, and which is used or will be used primarily for residential purposes: 
Provided
, That a home improvement loan shall include a loan, advance, or purchase with respect to the improvement of a structure which was constructed less than ten years prior to the making of such loan, advance, or purchase if the proceeds are or will be used primarily for major structural improvements, or to correct defects which were not known at the time of the completion of the structure or which were caused by fire, flood, windstorm, or other casualty; or




(ii)
 for the purpose of enabling the borrower to pay that part of the cost of the construction or installation of sidewalks, curbs, gutters, street paving, street lights, sewers, or other public improvements, adjacent to or in the vicinity of property owned by him and used primarily for residential purposes, which is assessed against him or for which he is otherwise legally liable as the owner of such property;






(B)

Such premium charges shall be payable by the financial institution either in cash or in debentures (at par plus accrued interest) issued by the Secretary as obligations of the General Insurance Fund, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, and the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the loan is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the loan. If the Secretary finds upon presentation of a loan for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the loan complies with the provisions of this subsection, such loan may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event the principal obligation of any loan accepted for insurance under this subsection is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the financial institution for the account of the borrower all, or such portions as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid.




(6)
 In cases of defaults on loans insured under this subsection, upon receiving notice of default, the Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may acquire the loan and any security therefor upon payment to the financial institution in cash or in debentures (as provided in the loan insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan, plus any accrued interest, any advances approved by the Secretary made previously by the financial institution under the provisions of the loan instruments, and reimbursement for such collection costs, court costs, and attorney fees as may be approved by the Secretary.

(7)
 Debentures issued under this subsection shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be negotiable, and, if in book entry form, transferable, in the manner described by the Secretary in regulations, and shall be dated as of the date the loan is assigned to the Secretary and shall bear interest from that date. They shall bear interest at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715
o
 of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature ten years after their date of issuance. They shall be exempt from taxation as provided in 
section 1713(i) of this title
 with respect to debentures issued under that section. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund which shall be primarily liable therefor and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and, in the case of debentures issued in certificated registered form, the guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon, to the extent of the amounts so paid, the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures. Debentures issued under this subsection shall be in such form and amounts; shall be subject to such terms and conditions; and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and may be in book entry or certificated registered form, or such other form as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may prescribe in regulations.

section 1703 of this title
 shall apply to home improvement loans insured under this subsection, and for the purposes of this subsection references in subsections (c), (d), and (h) of 
section 1703 of this title
 to “this section” or “this subchapter” shall be construed to refer to this subsection.




(9)
(A)
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no home improvement loan executed in connection with the improvement of a structure for use as rental accommodations for five or more families shall be insured under this subsection unless the borrower has agreed (i) to certify, upon completion of the improvement and prior to final endorsement of the loan, either that the actual cost of improvement equaled or exceeded the proceeds of the home improvement loan, or the amount by which the proceeds of the loan exceed the actual cost, as the case may be, and (ii) to pay forthwith to the financial institution, for application to the reduction of the principal of the loan, the amount, if any, certified to be in excess of the actual cost of improvement. Upon the Secretary’s approval of the borrower’s certification as required under this paragraph, the certification shall be final and incontestable, except for fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the borrower.




(B)
 As used in subparagraph (A), the term “actual cost” means the cost to the borrower of the improvement, including the amounts paid for labor, materials, construction contracts, off-site public utilities, streets, organization and legal expenses, such allocations of general overhead items as are acceptable to the Secretary, and other items of expense approved by the Secretary, plus a reasonable allowance for builder’s profit if the borrower is also the builder, as defined by the Secretary, and excluding the amount of any kickbacks, rebates, or trade discounts received in connection with the improvement.






(10)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized and empowered (i) to make expenditures and advances out of funds made available by this chapter to preserve and protect his interest in any security for, or the lien or priority of the lien securing, any loan or other indebtedness owing to, insured by, or acquired by the Secretary or by the United States under this subsection, or section 1703 or 1709(k) of this title; and (ii) to bid for and to purchase at any foreclosure or other sale or otherwise acquire property pledged, mortgaged, conveyed, attached, or levied upon to secure the payment of any loan or other indebtedness owing to or acquired by the Secretary or by the United States under this subsection or section 1703 or 1709(k) of this title. The authority conferred by this paragraph may be exercised as provided in the last sentence of 
section 1710(g) of this title
.




(11)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no home improvement loan made in whole or in part for the purpose specified in clause (A)(ii) of the second sentence of paragraph (1) shall be insured under this subsection if such loan (or the portion thereof which is attributable to such purpose), when added to the aggregate principal balance of any outstanding loans insured under this subsection or 
section 1709(k) of this title
 which were made to the same borrower for the purpose so specified (or the portion of such aggregate balance which is attributable to such purpose), would exceed $10,000 or such additional amount as the Secretary has by regulation prescribed in any geographical area where he finds cost levels so require pursuant to the authority vested in him by the proviso in paragraph (2)(i) of this subsection.

(e)
 “Mortgagor” defined; release of mortgagor or part of property
(1)
 A mortgagor which may be approved by the Secretary as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section includes a mortgagor which, as a condition of obtaining insurance of the mortgage and prior to the submission of its application for such insurance, has entered into an agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary) with a private nonprofit corporation eligible for an insured mortgage under the provisions of subsection (d)(3) of this section, that the mortgagor will sell the project when it is completed to the corporation at the actual cost of the project, as certified pursuant to 
section 1715r of this title
. The mortgagor to whom the property is sold shall be regulated or supervised by the Secretary as provided in subsection (d)(3) of this section to effectuate its purposes.




(2)

Provided
, That such units, in the case of a project designed primarily for occupancy by displaced, elderly, or handicapped families, need not, with the approval of the Secretary, contain kitchen facilities, and such projects may include central dining and other shared facilities. The Secretary is authorized to adopt such procedures and requirements as he determines are desirable to assure that the dwelling accommodations provided under this section are available to displaced families. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the Secretary, in order to assist further the provision of housing for low and moderate income families, in his discretion and under such conditions as he may prescribe, may insure a mortgage which meets the requirements of subsection (d)(3) of this section as in effect after 
June 30, 1961

Low- and moderate-income persons who are less than 62 years of age shall be eligible for occupancy of dwelling units in a project financed with a mortgage insured under subsection (d)(3) of this section. In any case in which it is determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary that facilities in existence or under construction on 
December 31, 1970
, which could appropriately be used for classroom purposes are available in any such property or project and that public schools in the community are overcrowded due in part to the attendance at such schools of residents of the property or project, such facilities may be used for such purposes to the extent permitted in such regulations (without being subject to any of the requirements of the proviso in 
section 1715k(d)(3)(B)(iv) of this title
 except the requirement that the project be predominantly residential).


As used in this section the terms “displaced family”, “displaced families”, and “displaced person” shall mean a family or families, or a person, displaced from an urban renewal area, or as a result of governmental action, or as a result of a major disaster as determined by the President pursuant to the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [

42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)
];




(B)
 phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and




(C)
 limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.





Assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437f
] shall be provided, to the extent available under appropriations Acts, if necessary to mitigate any adverse effects on income-eligible tenants.

section 1710(a) of this title
 with respect to mortgages insured under 
section 1709 of this title
, and the provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h),
2
 (j), and (k) 
2
 of 
section 1710 of this title
 shall be applicable to such mortgages insured under this section, except that all references therein to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund and all references therein to 
section 1709 of this title
 shall be construed to refer to this section; or




(2)
 as to mortgages meeting the requirements of paragraph (3) or (4) of subsection (d) of this section, paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this section, or paragraph (2) of subsection (j) of this section as provided in 
section 1713(g) of this title
 with respect to mortgages insured under said section 1713, and the provisions of subsections (h), (i), (j), (k), and (
l
) of 
section 1713 of this title
 shall be applicable to such mortgages insured under this section; or




(3)
 as to mortgages meeting the requirements of this section which are insured or initially endorsed for insurance on or after 
June 30, 1961
, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the Secretary in his discretion, in accordance with such regulations as he may prescribe, may make payments pursuant to such paragraphs in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract), or may acquire a mortgage loan that is in default and the security therefor upon payment to the mortgagee in cash or in debentures (as provided in the mortgage insurance contract) of a total amount equal to the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus any accrued interest and any advances approved by the Secretary and made previously by the mortgagee under the provisions of the mortgage, and after the acquisition of any such mortgage by the Secretary the mortgagee shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations with respect to the loan or the security for the loan. The appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the issuance of debentures shall apply with respect to debentures issued under this paragraph, and the appropriate provisions of sections 1710 and 1713 of this title relating to the rights, liabilities, and obligations of a mortgagee shall apply with respect to the Secretary when he has acquired an insured mortgage under this paragraph, in accordance with and subject to regulations (modifying such provisions to the extent necessary to render their application for such purposes appropriate and effective) which shall be prescribed by the Secretary, except that as applied to mortgages so acquired (A) all references in 
section 1710 of this title
 to the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund or the Fund shall be construed to refer to the General Insurance Fund, and (B) all references in 
section 1710 of this title
 to 
section 1709 of this title
 shall be construed to refer to this section. If the insurance is paid in cash, there shall be added to such payment an amount equivalent to the interest which the debentures would have earned, computed to a date to be established pursuant to regulations issued by the Secretary.




(4)
(A)
 in the event any mortgage insured under this section pursuant to a commitment to insure entered into before 
November 30, 1983
, is not in default at the expiration of twenty years from the date the mortgage was endorsed for insurance, the mortgagee shall, within a period thereafter to be determined by the Secretary, have the option to assign, transfer, and deliver to the Secretary the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing the same and receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided in this paragraph, upon compliance with such requirements and conditions as to the validity of the mortgage as a first lien and such other matters as may be prescribed by the Secretary at the time the loan is endorsed for insurance. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall issue to the mortgagee debentures having a par value equal to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the assignment, plus accrued interest to such date. Debentures issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be issued in the same manner and subject to the same terms and conditions as debentures issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that the debentures issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be dated as of the date the mortgage is assigned to the Secretary, shall mature ten years after such date, and shall bear interest from such date at the going Federal rate determined at the time of issuance. The term “going Federal rate” as used herein means the annual rate of interest which the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify as applicable to the six-month period (consisting of January through June or July through December) which includes the issuance date of such debentures, which applicable rate for each such six-month period shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by estimating the average yield to maturity, on the basis of daily closing market bid quotations or prices during the month of May or the month of November, as the case may be, next preceding such six-month period, on all outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a maturity date of eight to twelve years from the first day of such month of May or November (or, if no such obligations are outstanding, the obligation next shorter than eight years and the obligation next longer than twelve years, respectively, shall be used), and by adjusting such estimated average annual yield to the nearest one-eight of 1 per centum. The Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to mortgages assigned to him under this paragraph as contained in sections 1713(k) and 1713(
l
) of this title as to mortgages insured by the Secretary and assigned to him under 
section 1713 of this title
.




(B)
 In processing a claim for insurance benefits under this paragraph, the Secretary may direct the mortgagee to assign, transfer, and deliver the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing it directly to the Government National Mortgage Association in lieu of assigning, transferring, and delivering the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Secretary. Upon the assignment, transfer, and delivery of the credit instrument and the mortgage to the Association, the mortgage insurance contract shall terminate and the mortgagee shall receive insurance benefits as provided in subparagraph (A). The Association is authorized to accept such loan documents in its own name and to hold, service, and sell such loans as agent for the Secretary. The mortgagor’s obligation to pay a service charge in lieu of a mortgage insurance premium shall continue as long as the mortgage is held by the Association or by the Secretary. The Secretary shall have the same authority with respect to mortgages assigned to the Secretary or the Association under this subparagraph as provided by 
section 1715n(c) of this title
.




(C)
(i)
 In lieu of accepting assignment of the original credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument under subparagraph (A) in exchange for receipt of debentures, the Secretary shall arrange for the sale of the beneficial interests in the mortgage loan through an auction and sale of the (I) mortgage loans, or (II) participation certificates, or other mortgage-backed obligations in a form acceptable to the Secretary (in this subparagraph referred to as “participation certificates”). The Secretary shall arrange the auction and sale at a price, to be paid to the mortgagee, of par plus accrued interest to the date of sale. The sale price shall also include the right to a subsidy payment described in clause (iii).




(ii)
(I)
 The Secretary shall conduct a public auction to determine the lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the beneficial interests in the original credit instrument and mortgage securing the credit instrument.




(II)
 A mortgagee who elects to assign a mortgage shall provide the Secretary and persons bidding at the auction a description of the characteristics of the original credit instrument and mortgage securing the original credit instrument, which shall include the principal mortgage balance, original stated interest rate, service fees, real estate and tenant characteristics, the level and duration of applicable Federal subsidies, and any other information determined by the Secretary to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also provide information regarding the status of the property with respect to the provisions of the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act with respect to eligibility to prepay the mortgage, a statement of whether the owner has filed a notice of intent to prepay or a plan of action under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act, and the details with respect to incentives provided under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act in lieu of exercising prepayment rights.




(III)
 The Secretary shall, upon receipt of the information in subclause (II), promptly advertise for an auction and publish such mortgage descriptions in advance of the auction. The Secretary may conduct the auction at any time during the 6-month period beginning upon receipt of the information in subclause (II) but under no circumstances may the Secretary conduct an auction before 2 months after receiving the mortgagee’s written notice of intent to assign its mortgage to the Secretary.




(IV)
 In any auction under this subparagraph, the Secretary shall accept the lowest interest rate bid for purchase that the Secretary determines to be acceptable. The Secretary shall cause the accepted bid to be published in the Federal Register. Settlement for the sale of the credit instrument and the mortgage securing the credit instrument shall occur not later than 30 business days after the date winning bidders are selected in the auction, unless the Secretary determines that extraordinary circumstances require an extension (not to exceed 60 days) of the period.




(V)
 If no bids are received, the bids that are received are not acceptable to the Secretary, or settlement does not occur within the period under subclause (IV), the mortgagee shall retain all rights (including the right to interest, at a rate to be determined by the Secretary, for the period covering any actions taken under this subparagraph) under this section to assign the mortgage loan to the Secretary.






(iii)
 As part of the auction process, the Secretary shall agree to provide a monthly interest subsidy payment from the General Insurance Fund to the purchaser under the auction of the original credit instrument or the mortgage securing the credit instrument (and any subsequent holders or assigns who are approved mortgagees). The subsidy payment shall be paid on the first day of each month in an amount equal to the difference between the stated interest due on the mortgage loan and the lowest interest rate necessary to accomplish a sale of the mortgage loan or participation certificates (less the servicing fee, if appropriate) for the then unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest at a rate determined by the Secretary. Each interest subsidy payment shall be treated by the holder of the mortgage as interest paid on the mortgage. The interest subsidy payment shall be provided until the earlier of—
(I)
 the maturity date of the loan;




(II)
 prepayment of the mortgage loan in accordance with the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or any subsequent Act, where applicable; or




(III)
 default and full payment of insurance benefits on the mortgage loan by the Federal Housing Administration.






(iv)
 The Secretary shall require that the mortgage loans or participation certificates presented for assignment are auctioned as whole loans with servicing rights released and also are auctioned with servicing rights retained by the current servicer.




(v)
 To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall encourage State housing finance agencies, nonprofit organizations, and organizations representing the tenants of the property securing the mortgage, or a qualified mortgagee participating in a plan of action under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent Act to participate in the auction.




(vi)
 The Secretary shall implement the requirements imposed by this subparagraph within 30 days from 
November 5, 1990
, and not be subject to the requirement of prior issuance of regulations in the Federal Register. The Secretary shall issue regulations implementing this section within 6 months of 
November 5, 1990
.




(vii)
 Nothing in this subparagraph shall diminish or impair the low income use restrictions applicable to the project under the original regulatory agreement or the revised agreement entered into pursuant to the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent Act, if any, or other agreements for the provision of Federal assistance to the housing or its tenants.




(viii)
 This subparagraph shall not apply after 
December 31, 2002
, except that this subparagraph shall continue to apply if the Secretary receives a mortgagee’s written notice of intent to assign its mortgage to the Secretary on or before such date. Not later than January 31 of each year (beginning in 1992), the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report including statements of the number of mortgages auctioned and sold and their value, the amount of subsidies committed to the program under this subparagraph, the ability of the Secretary to coordinate the program with the incentives provided under the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 or subsequent Act, and the costs and benefits derived from the program for the Federal Government.




(ix)
 The authority of the Secretary to conduct multifamily auctions under this paragraph shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and in such amounts as are approved in appropriations Acts for the costs of loan guarantees (as defined in 
section 661a of title 2
), including the cost of modifying loans.








(h)
 Insurance of mortgages to finance purchase and rehabilitation by nonprofit organizations of housing for resale to low-income purchasers, and insurance of mortgages executed for the purpose of financing rehabilitation or improvement of dwellings owned and occupied by mortgagors who purchased from nonprofit organizations
(1)
 In addition to mortgages insured under the other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this subsection as hereinafter provided any mortgage (including advances under such mortgage during rehabilitation) which is executed by a nonprofit organization to finance the purchase and rehabilitation of deteriorating or substandard housing for subsequent resale to low-income home purchasers and, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for the insurance of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon.




(2)
 To be eligible for insurance under paragraph (1) of this subsection, a mortgage shall—
(A)
 be executed by a private nonprofit corporation or association, approved by the Secretary, for financing the purchase and rehabilitation (with the intention of subsequent resale) of property comprising one or more tracts or parcels, whether or not contiguous, upon which there is located deteriorating or substandard housing consisting of (i) four or more single-family dwellings of detached, semidetached, or row construction, or (ii) four or more one-family units in a structure or structures for which a plan of family unit ownership approved by the Secretary is established;




(B)
 be secured by the property which is to be purchased and rehabilitated with the proceeds thereof;




(C)
 be in a principal amount not exceeding the appraised value of the property at the time of its purchase under the mortgage plus the estimated cost of the rehabilitation;




(D)
 bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance and service charge, if any) at the rate in effect under the proviso in subsection (d)(5) of this section at the time of execution;




(E)
 provide for complete amortization (subject to paragraph (5)(E)) by periodic payments within such term as the Secretary may prescribe; and




(F)
 provide for the release of individual single-family dwellings from the lien of the mortgage upon the sale of the rehabilitated dwellings in accordance with paragraph (5).






(3)
 No mortgage shall be insured under paragraph (1) unless the mortgagor shall have demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that (A) the property to be rehabilitated is located in a neighborhood which is sufficiently stable and contains sufficient public facilities and amenities to support long-term values, or (B) the rehabilitation to be carried out by the mortgagor plus its related activities and the activities of other owners of housing in the neighborhood, together with actions to be taken by public authorities, will be of such scope and quality as to give reasonable promise that a stable environment will be created in the neighborhood.




(4)
 The aggregate principal balance of all mortgages insured under paragraph (1) and outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $50,000,000.




(5)
(A)
 No mortgage shall be insured under paragraph (1) unless the mortgagor enters into an agreement (in form and substance satisfactory to the Secretary) that it will offer to sell the dwellings involved, upon completion of their rehabilitation, to individuals or families (hereinafter referred to as “low-income purchasers”) determined by the Secretary to have incomes below the maximum amount specified (with respect to the area involved) in 
section 1701s(c)(1) of this title
.




(B)
 The Secretary is authorized to insure under this paragraph mortgages executed to finance the sale of individual dwellings to low-income purchasers as provided in subparagraph (A). Any such mortgage shall—
(i)
 be in a principal amount equal to that portion of the unpaid balance of the principal mortgage covering the property (insured under paragraph (1)) which is allocable to the individual dwelling involved; and




(ii)
 bear interest at the same rate as the principal mortgage or such lower rate, not less than 1 per centum, as the Secretary may prescribe if in his judgment the purchaser’s income is sufficiently low to justify the lower rate, and provide for complete amortization within a term equal to the remaining term (determined without regard to subparagraph (E)) of such principal mortgage: 
Provided
, That, if the rate of interest initially prescribed is less than the rate borne by the principal mortgage and the purchaser’s income (as determined on the basis of periodic review) subsequently rises, the rate of interest so prescribed shall be increased (but not above the rate borne by such principal mortgage), under regulations of the Secretary, to the extent appropriate to reflect the increase in such income, and the mortgage shall so provide.






(C)
 The price for which any individual dwelling is sold to a low-income purchaser under this paragraph shall be the amount of the mortgage covering the sale as determined under subparagraph (B), except that the purchaser shall in addition thereto be required to pay on account of the property at the time of purchase such amount (which shall not be less than $200, but which may be applied in whole or in part toward closing costs) as the Secretary may determine to be reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.




(D)
 Upon the sale under this paragraph of any individual dwelling, such dwelling shall be released from the lien of the principal mortgage, and such mortgage shall thereupon be replaced by an individual mortgage insured under this paragraph to the extent of the portion of its unpaid balance which is allocable to the dwelling covered by such individual mortgage. Until all of the individual dwellings in the property covered by the principal mortgage have been sold, the mortgagor shall hold and operate the dwellings remaining unsold at any given time as though they constituted rental units in a project covered by a mortgage which is insured under subsection (d)(3) (and which receives the benefits of the interest rate provided for in the proviso in subsection (d)(5) of this section).




(E)
 Upon the sale under this paragraph of all of the individual dwellings in the property covered by the principal mortgage, and the release of all individual dwellings from the lien of the principal mortgage, the insurance of the principal mortgage shall be terminated and no adjusted premium charge shall be charged by the Secretary upon such termination.




(F)
 Any mortgage insured under this paragraph shall contain a provision that if the low-income mortgagor does not continue to occupy the property the interest rate shall increase to the highest rate permissible under this section and the regulations of the Secretary effective at the time of commitment for insurance of the principal mortgage; except that the increase in interest rate shall not be applicable if the property is sold and the purchaser is (i) the nonprofit organization which executed the principal mortgage, (ii) a public housing agency having jurisdiction under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437
 et seq.] over the area where the dwelling is located, or (iii) a low-income purchaser approved for the purposes of this paragraph by the Secretary.






(6)
 In addition to the mortgages that may be insured under paragraphs (1) and (5), the Secretary is authorized to insure under this subsection at any time within one year after 
August 1, 1968
, upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, mortgages which are executed by individuals or families that meet the income criteria prescribed in paragraph (5)(A) and are executed for the purpose of financing the rehabilitation or improvement of single-family dwellings of detached, semidetached, or row construction that are owned in each instance by a mortgagor who has purchased the dwelling from a nonprofit organization of the type described in this subsection. To be eligible for such insurance, a mortgage shall—
(A)
 be in a principal amount not exceeding the lesser of $18,000 or the sum of the estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation and the Secretary’s estimate of the value of the property before repair and rehabilitation, except that in no case involving refinancing shall such mortgage exceed such estimated cost of repair and rehabilitation and the amount (as determined by the Secretary) required to refinance existing indebtedness secured by the property;




(B)
 bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance and service charge, if any) at 3 per centum per annum or such lower rate, not less than 1 per centum, as the Secretary may prescribe if in his judgment the mortgagor’s income is sufficiently low to justify the lower rate: 
Provided
, That, if the rate of interest initially prescribed is less than 3 per centum per annum and the mortgagor’s income (as determined on the basis of periodic review) subsequently rises, the rate shall be increased (but not above 3 per centum), under regulations of the Secretary, to the extent appropriate to reflect the increase in such income, and the mortgage shall so provide;




(C)
 involve a mortgagor that shall have paid on account of the property at the time of the rehabilitation such amount (which shall not be less than $200 in cash or its equivalent, but which may be applied in whole or in part toward closing costs) as the Secretary may determine to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances; and




(D)
 contain a provision that, if the low-income mortgagor does not continue to occupy the property, the interest rate shall increase to the highest rate permissible under this section and the regulations of the Secretary effective at the time the commitment was issued for insurance of the mortgage; except that the increase in interest rate shall not be applicable if the property is sold and the purchaser is (i) a nonprofit organization which has been engaged in purchasing and rehabilitating deteriorating and substandard housing with financing under a mortgage insured under paragraph (1) of this subsection, (ii) a public housing agency having jurisdiction under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437
 et seq.] over the area where the dwelling is located, or (iii) a low-income purchaser approved for the purposes of this paragraph by the Secretary.






(7)
 Where the Secretary has approved a plan of family unit ownership, the terms “single-family dwelling”, “single-family dwellings”, “individual dwelling”, and “individual dwellings” shall mean a family unit or family units, together with the undivided interest (or interests) in the common areas and facilities.




(8)

(2)
(A)
 The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this subsection mortgages financing the purchase of individual family units under the plan prescribed in paragraph (1). Commitments may be issued by the Secretary for the insurance of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.

(iii)
 bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary (which may vary in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary promulgated pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph (4) of this subsection) but not less than the below-market rate in effect under the proviso of subsection (d)(5) of this section at the date of the commitment for insurance; and

(3)
 Upon the sale of all of the family units covered by the project mortgage, and the release of all of the family units (including the undivided interest allocable to each unit in the common areas and facilities) from the lien of the project mortgage, the insurance of the proj­ect mortgage shall be terminated and no adjusted premium charge shall be collected by the Secretary upon such termination.




(4)
 Any mortgage covering an individual family unit insured under this subsection shall contain a provision that, if the original mortgagor does not continue to occupy the property, the interest rate shall increase to the highest rate permissible under this section and the regulations of the Secretary effective at the time the commitment was issued for the insurance of the project mortgage; except that the requirement for an increase in interest rate shall not be applicable if the property is sold and the purchaser is (i) a nonprofit purchaser approved by the Secretary, or (ii) a low or moderate income purchaser who has an income within the limits prescribed by the Secretary for occupants of projects financed with a mortgage insured under subsection (d)(3) of this section which bears interest at the below-market rate prescribed in the proviso of subsection (d)(5) of this section. The mortgage shall also contain a provision that, if the Secretary determines that the annual income of the original mortgagor (or a purchaser described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence) has increased to an amount enabling payment of a greater rate of interest, the interest rate of the individual mortgage may be increased up to the highest rate permissible under the regulations of the Secretary for mortgages insured under this section, effective at the time the commitment was issued for the insurance of the mortgage.

 For the purpose of this subsection—
(i)
 the term “mortgage”, when used in relation to a mortgage insured under paragraph (2) of this subsection, includes a first mortgage given to secure the unpaid purchase price of a fee interest in, or a long-term lease-hold interest in, a one-family unit in a multifamily project and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project; and

Membership in such cooperative shall be made available only to those families having an income within the limits prescribed by the Secretary for occupants of projects financed with a mortgage insured under subsection (d)(3) of this section which bears interest at such below-market rate: 
Provided
, That families residing in the rental project at the time of its conversion to a cooperative who do not meet such income limits may be permitted to become members in the cooperative under such special terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.




(2)
 The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this subsection cooperative mortgages financing the purchase of projects meeting the requirements of paragraph (1). Commitments may be issued by the Secretary for the insurance of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. To be eligible for such insurance, the mortgage shall—
(i)
 involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges and appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not exceeding the appraised value of the property for continued use as a cooperative, which value shall be based upon a mortgage amount on which the debt service can be met from the income of the property when operated on a nonprofit basis, after the payment of all operating expenses, taxes, and required reserves;




(ii)
 bear interest at the below-market rate prescribed in the proviso of subsection (d)(5) of this section; and

With respect to any project insured under subsection (d)(3) or (d)(4) of this section, the Secretary may further increase the dollar amount limitations which would otherwise apply for the purpose of those subsections by up to 20 per centum if such increase is necessary to account for the increased cost of the project due to the installation therein of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the last paragraph of 
section 1703(a) of this title
) or residential energy conservation measures (as defined in section 8211(11)(A) through (G) and (I) of title 42)

], this section shall be deemed to have taken effect immediately before the enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act.”


“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 in the next 15 years, more than 330,000 low income housing units insured or assisted under sections 221(d)(3) and 236 of the National Housing Act [
12 U.S.C. 1715
l
(d)(3), 1715z–1] could be lost as a result of the termination of low income affordability restrictions;




“(2)
 in the next decade, more than 465,000 low income housing units produced with assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437f
] could be lost as a result of the expiration of the rental assistance contracts;




“(3)
 some 150,000 units of rural low income housing financed under section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949 [
42 U.S.C. 1485
] are threatened with loss as a result of the prepayment of mortgages by owners;




“(4)
 the loss of this privately owned and federally assisted housing, which would occur in a period of sharply rising rents on unassisted housing and extremely low production of additional low rent housing, would inflict unacceptable harm on current tenants and would precipitate a grave national crisis in the supply of low income housing that was neither anticipated nor intended when contracts for these units were entered into;




“(5)
 the loss of this affordable housing, to encourage the production of which the public has provided substantial benefits over past years, would irreparably damage hard-won progress toward such important and long-established national objectives as—
“(A)
 providing a more adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing that is affordable to low income Americans;




“(B)
 increasing the supply of housing affordable to low income Americans that is accessible to employment opportunities; and




“(C)
 expanding housing opportunities for all Americans, particularly members of disadvantaged minorities;






“(6)
 the provision of an adequate supply of low income housing has depended and will continue to depend upon a strong, long-term partnership between the public and private sectors that accommodates a fair return on investment;




“(7)
 recent reductions in Federal housing assistance and tax benefits related to low income housing have increased the incentives for private industry to withdraw from the production and management of low income housing;




“(8)
 efforts to retain this housing must take account of specific financial and market conditions that differ markedly from project to project;




“(9)
 a major review of alternative responses to this threatened loss of affordable housing is now being undertaken by numerous private sector task forces as well as State and local organizations; and




“(10)
 until the Congress can act on recommendations that will emerge from this review, interim measures are needed to avoid the irreplaceable loss of low income housing and irrevocable displacement of current tenants.




“(b)
 
Purpose
.—
It is the purpose of this title—
“(1)
 to preserve and retain to the maximum extent practicable as housing affordable to low income families or persons those privately owned dwelling units that were produced for such purpose with Federal assistance;




“(2)
 to minimize the involuntary displacement of tenants currently residing in such housing; and




“(3)
 to continue the partnership between all levels of government and the private sector in the production and operation of housing that is affordable to low income Americans.

Plan of Action Involving Termination of Low Income Affordability Restrictions
.—
The Secretary may approve a plan of action that involves termination of the low income affordability restrictions only upon a written finding that—
“(1)
 implementation of the plan of action will not materially increase economic hardship for current tenants (and will not in any event result in (A) a monthly rental payment by a current tenant that exceeds 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the tenant or an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds 10 percent (whichever is lower), or (B) in the case of a current tenant who already pays more than such percentage, an increase in the monthly rental payment in any year that exceeds the increase in the Consumer Price Index or 10 percent (whichever is lower)) or involuntarily displace current tenants (except for good cause) where comparable and affordable housing is not readily available, determined without regard to the availability of Federal housing assistance that would address any such hardship or involuntary displacement; and




“(2)
(A)
 the supply of vacant, comparable housing is sufficient to ensure that such prepayment will not materially affect—
“(i)
 the availability of decent, safe, and sanitary housing affordable to lower income and very low-income families or persons in the area that the housing could reasonably be expected to serve;




“(ii)
 the ability of lower income and very low-income families or persons to find affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing near employment opportunities; or

“(B)
 the plan has been approved by the appropriate State agency and any appropriate local government agency for the jurisdiction within which the housing is located as being in accordance with a State strategy approved by the Secretary under section 226.






“(b)
 
Plan of Action Including Incentives
.—
The Secretary may approve a plan of action that includes incentives only upon finding that—
“(1)
 the package of incentives is necessary to provide a fair return on the investment of the owner;




“(2)
 due diligence has been given to ensuring that the package of incentives is, for the Federal Government, the least costly alternative that is consistent with the full achievement of the purposes of this title; and




“(3)
 binding commitments have been made to ensure that—
“(A)
 the housing will be retained as housing affordable for very low-income families or persons, lower income families or persons, and moderate income families or persons for the remaining term of the mortgage;




“(B)
 throughout such period, adequate expenditures will be made for maintenance and operation of the housing;




“(C)
 current tenants shall not be involuntarily displaced (except for good cause);




“(D)
 any increase in rent contributions for current tenants shall be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the fair market rent for comparable housing under section 8(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437f(b)
], whichever is lower;




“(E)
(i)
 any resulting increase in rents for current tenants (except for increases made necessary by increased operating costs)—
“(I)
 shall be phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and




“(II)
 shall be limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent; and






“(ii)
 assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 shall be provided if necessary to mitigate any adverse affect on current income eligible tenants; and






“(F)
(i)
 rents for units becoming available to new tenants shall be at levels approved by the Secretary that will ensure, to the extent practicable, that the units will be available and affordable to the same proportions of very low-income families or persons, lower income families or persons, and moderate income families or persons (including families or persons whose incomes are 95 percent or more of area median income) as resided in the housing as of 
January 1, 1987
 (based on the area median income limits established by the Secretary in February, 1987), or the date the plan of action is approved, whichever date results in the highest proportion of very low-income families, except that this limitation shall not prohibit a higher proportion of very low-income families from occupying the housing; and




“(ii)
 in approving rents under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account any additional incentives provided under this subtitle and shall make provision for such annual rent adjustments as may be made necessary by future reasonable increases in operating costs.








“(c)
 
Section
 8 
Rental Assistance
.—
When providing rental assistance under section 8 [of the United States Housing Act of 1937, 
42 U.S.C. 1437f
], the Secretary may enter into a contract with an owner, contingent upon the future availability of appropriations for the purpose of renewing expiring contracts for rental assistance as provided in appropriations Acts, to extend the term of such rental assistance for such additional period or periods as is necessary to carry out an approved plan of action. The contract and the approved plan of action shall provide that, if the Secretary is unable to extend the term of such rental assistance or is unable to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits to the owner comparable to those received under the original approved plan of action, the Secretary, upon the request of the owner, shall take the following actions (subject to the limitations under the following paragraphs):—
“(1)
 Modification of the binding commitments made pursuant to subsection (b) that are dependent on such rental assistance.




“(2)
 If action under paragraph (1) is not feasible, release of an owner from the binding commitments made pursuant to subsection (b) that are dependent on such rental assistance.




“(3)
 If action under paragraphs (1) and (2) would, in the determination of the Secretary, result in the default of the insured loan, approval of the revised plan of action, notwithstanding subsection (a), that involves the termination of low-income affordability restrictions.





At least 30 days prior to making a request under the preceding sentence, an owner shall notify the Secretary of the owner’s intention to submit the request. The Secretary shall have a period of 90 days following receipt of such notice to take action to extend the rental assistance contract and to continue the binding commitments under subsection (b).


“(d)
 
Relocation of Displaced Tenants

Any plan of action shall specify actions that the Secretary and the owner shall take to ensure that any tenants, displaced as a result of a plan of action approved under subsection (a) or as a result of modifications taken pursuant to subsection (c), are relocated to affordable housing.


“(a)
 
Criteria for Approval
.—
The Secretary may approve a State strategy for purposes of section 225(a) only upon finding that it is a practicable statewide strategy that ensures at a minimum that—

 current tenants will not be involuntarily displaced (except for good cause);




“(2)
 housing opportunities for minorities will not be adversely affected in the communities within which the housing is located;




“(3)
 any increase in rent for current tenants shall be to a level that does not exceed 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenants or the fair market rent for comparable housing under section 8(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [
42 U.S.C. 1437f(b)
], whichever is lower, except that any increase not necessitated by increased operating costs shall be phased in equally over not less than 3 years if such increase exceeds 10 percent;




“(4)
 housing approved under the State strategy will remain affordable to very low-income, lower income or moderate income families and persons for not less than the remaining term of the original mortgage, if the housing is to be made available for rental, or for not less than 40 years, if the housing is to be made available for homeownership;




“(5)

 not less than 80 of all units in eligible low income housing approved under the State strategy shall be retained as affordable to families or persons meeting the income eligibility standards for initial occupancy that applies to the housing on 
January 1, 1987
; and




“(B)
 not less than 60 percent of the units in any one project shall remain available and affordable to such families or persons, within which not less than 20 percent of the units shall remain available and affordable to very low income families or persons as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families;






“(6)

l
(d)(3) of this title any mortgage executed by a mortgagor of the character described therein where such mortgage is given to refinance a mortgage covering an existing property or project (other than a one- to four-family structure) located in an urban renewal area, if the Secretary finds that such insurance will facilitate the occupancy of dwelling units in the property or project by families of low or moderate income or families displaced from an urban renewal area or displaced as a result of governmental action.

The Secretary shall also have authority to insure under this chapter any mortgage assigned to the Secretary in connection with payment under a contract of mortgage insurance or executed in connection with the sale by the Secretary, including a sale through another entity acting under authority of the fourth sentence of 
section 1710(g) of this title
, of any property acquired under any section or subchapter of this chapter without regard to any limitations or requirements contained in this chapter upon the eligibility of the mortgage, upon the payment of insurance premiums, or upon the terms and conditions of insurance settlement and the benefits of the insurance to be included in such settlement.




(d)
 Insurance of loans made to cover operating losses of certain projects having existing mortgages insured by Secretary
(1)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized to insure loans made to cover the operating losses of certain projects that have existing project mortgages insured by the Secretary. Insurance under this subsection shall be in the Secretary’s discretion and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, and shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, the term “operating loss” means the amount by which the sum of the taxes, interest on the mortgage debt, mortgage insurance premiums, hazard insurance premiums, and the expense of maintenance and operation of the project covered by the mortgage, exceeds the income of the project.




(2)
 To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph—
(A)
 the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after 
February 5, 1988
; and (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling;




(B)
 the operating loss shall have occurred during the first 24 months after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary; and




(C)
 the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding the operating loss.






(3)
 To be eligible for insurance pursuant to this paragraph—
(A)
 the existing project mortgage (i) shall have been insured by the Secretary at any time before or after 
February 5, 1988
; (ii) shall cover any property, other than a property upon which there is located a 1- to 4-family dwelling; and (iii) shall not cover a subsidized project, as defined by the Secretary;




(B)
 the loan shall be in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of the unreimbursed cash contributions made on or after 
March 18, 1987
, by the project owner for the use of the project, during any period of consecutive months (not exceeding 24 months) in the first 10 years after the date of completion of the project, as determined by the Secretary, except that in no event may the amount of the loan exceed the operating loss during such period;




(C)
 the loan shall be made within 10 years after the end of the period of consecutive months referred to in the preceding subparagraph; and




(D)
 the project shall meet all applicable underwriting and other requirements of the Secretary at the time the loan is to be made.






(4)
 Any loan insured pursuant to this subsection shall (A) bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the mortgagor and mortgagee; (B) be secured in such manner as the Secretary shall require; (C) be limited to a term not exceeding the unexpired term of the original mortgage; and (D) be insured under the same section as the original mortgage. The Secretary may provide insurance pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3), or pursuant to both such paragraphs, in connection with an existing project mortgage, except that the Secretary may not provide insurance pursuant to both such paragraphs in connection with the same period of months referred to in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B). The Secretary is authorized to collect a premium charge for insurance of loans pursuant to this subsection in an amount computed at the same premium rate as is applicable to the original mortgage. This premium shall be payable in cash or in debentures of the insurance fund under which the loan is insured at par plus accrued interest. In the event of a failure of the borrower to make any payment due under such loan or under the original mortgage, both the loan and original mortgage shall be considered in default, and if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the lender shall be entitled to insurance benefits, computed in the same manner as for the original mortgage, except that in determining the interest rate under section 1715
o
 of this title for the debentures representing the portion of the claim applicable to the loan, the date of the commitment to insure the loan and the insurance date of the loan shall be taken into consideration rather than the commitment or insurance date for the original mortgage.




(5)
 A loan involving a project covered by a mortgage insured under 
section 1715e of this title
 that is the obligation of the Cooperative Management Housing Insurance Fund shall be the obligation of such fund, and loans involving projects covered by a mortgage insured under 
section 1715z–1 of this title
 or under any section of this subchapter pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.




(6)
 In determining the amount of an operating loss loan to be insured pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall not reduce such amount solely to reflect any amounts placed in escrow (at the time the existing project mortgage was insured) for initial operating deficits. If an operating loss loan was insured by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection before 
October 28, 1992
, and was reduced solely to reflect the amount placed in escrow for initial operating deficits, the Secretary shall insure, to the extent of the availability of insurance authority provided in appropriation Acts, an increase in the existing loan or a separate loan, in an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the maximum amount permitted under this subsection and the applicable underwriting requirements established by the Secretary and in effect at the time the loan is to be made, or (B) the amount of the escrow for initial operating deficits.




(e)
 Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property in older, declining urban areas
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter except 
section 1715c of this title
, and without regard to limitations upon eligibility contained in any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX–B, other than the limitation in 
section 1709(g) of this title
, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under any section of this subchapter or subchapter IX–B a mortgage executed in connection with the repair, rehabilitation, construction, or purchase of property located in an older, declining urban area in which the conditions are such that one or more of the eligibility requirements applicable to the section or subchapter under which insurance is sought could not be met, if the Secretary finds that (1) the area is reasonably viable, giving consideration to the need for providing adequate housing or group practice facilities for families of low and moderate income in such area, and (2) the property is an acceptable risk in view of such consideration. The insurance of a mortgage pursuant to this subsection shall be the obligation of the Special Risk Insurance Fund.




(f)
 Insurance of mortgages executed in connection with purchase or refinancing of existing multifamily housing project; refinancing of existing debt of existing hospital, or purchase or refinancing of rental rehabilitated property; terms and conditions, etc.
(1)
 Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter, the Secretary is authorized, in his discretion, to insure under any section of this subchapter a mortgage executed in connection with the purchase of

 So in original. Probably should be “or”.
 refinancing of an existing multifamily housing project or the purchase or refinancing of existing debt of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof).




(2)
 In the case of the purchase or refinancing under this subsection of a multifamily housing project located in an older, declining urban area, the Secretary shall make available an amount not to exceed $30,000,000 of available purchase authority pursuant to section 1720 
1
 of this title to reduce interest rates on low- and moderate-income rental housing in projects having 100 units or less which otherwise could not support refinancing and moderate rehabilitation without causing excessive rent burdens on current tenants due to rent increases. The Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as he deems necessary to assure that—
(A)
 the refinancing is used to lower the monthly debt service only to the extent necessary to assure the continued economic viability of the project, taking into account any rent reductions to be implemented by the mortgagor; and




(B)
 during the mortgage term no rental increases shall be made except those which are necessary to offset actual and reasonable operating expense increases or other necessary expense increases and maintain reasonable profit levels approved by the Secretary.






(3)
 For all insurance authorized by this subsection and provided pursuant to a commitment entered into after 
October 8, 1980
, the Secretary may not accept an offer to prepay or request refinancing of a mortgage secured by rental housing unless the Secretary takes appropriate action that will obligate the borrower (and successors in interest thereof) to utilize the property as a rental property for a period of five years from the date on which the insurance was provided (twenty years in the case of any such mortgage purchased under section 1720 
1
 of this title) unless the Secretary finds that—
(A)
 the conversion of the property to a cooperative, or condominium form of ownership is sponsored by a bona fide tenants’ organization representing a majority of the households in the project;




(B)
 continuance of the property as rental housing is clearly unnecessary to assure adequate rental housing opportunities for low- and moderate-income people in the community; or




(C)
 continuance of the property as rental housing would have an undesirable and deleterious effect on the surrounding neighborhood.






(4)
 In the case of refinancing of an existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) the Secretary shall prescribe such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that—
(A)
 the refinancing is employed to lower the monthly debt service costs (taking into account any fees or charges connected with such refinancing) of such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);




(B)
 the proceeds of any refinancing will be employed only to retire the existing indebtedness and pay the necessary cost of refinancing on such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof);




(C)
 such existing hospital (or existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, existing intermediate care facility, existing board and care home, or any combination thereof) is economically viable; and




(D)
 the applicable requirements for certificates, studies, and statements of 
section 1715w of this title
 (for the existing nursing home, existing assisted living facility, intermediate care facility, board and care home, or any combination thereof, proposed to be refinanced) or of 
section 1715z–7 of this title
 (for the existing hospital proposed to be refinanced) have been met.






(5)
 In the case of any purchase or refinancing under this subsection involving property to be rehabilitated or developed under section 1437
o
 
1
 of title 42, the Secretary may—
(A)
 include rehabilitation or development costs of not to exceed $20,000 per unit, except that the Secretary may increase such amount by not to exceed 25 per centum for specific properties where cost levels so require;




(B)
 permit subordinated liens securing up to the full amount of mortgage financing provided by State or local governments or agencies thereof; and




(C)
 pay such benefits in cash unless the mortgagee submits a written request for debenture payment.






(g)

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the Secretary may, in his discretion, insure a mortgage covering a multifamily housing project including units which are not self-contained.




“(a)
 The Secretary is authorized to sell such dwelling houses, duplex houses or units thereof, and garages, with furniture, fixtures, and appurtenances, as are owned by the United States within the Boulder City municipal area and are not needed in connection with the administration, operation, and maintenance of Federal activities located within or near the Boulder City municipal area.

This right of priority shall expire unless notice of intent to purchase has been received by the Secretary before the expiration of sixty days after the date on which the property has been offered for sale, and shall be deemed abandoned unless before the expiration of sixty days after the Secretary’s tender of the instrument of transfer the prospective purchaser concludes the sale;




“(2)
 Persons employed by the Federal Government within or near the Boulder City municipal area may apply to purchase housing not purchased under subsection (b)(1) of this section. Applicants to purchase shall be placed in order of opportunity to choose pursuant to a public drawing, but spouses of such applicants shall not be entitled to apply. Sales shall be made at the appraised value as established under subsection (d) of this section and selections and purchases by successful applicants shall be concluded within limits of time to be established by the Secretary. A purchase under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall render the purchaser and any spouse of such purchaser ineligible thereafter to purchase under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2); and




“(3)
 Property subject to disposal under this section and not sold pursuant to subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall be opened to bids from the general public, and shall be sold to the highest responsible bidder.
“In the event that incorporation of the municipality shall be effected within four years after the date of this Act, persons purchasing housing under this subsection or their successors, assigns, or legal representatives, shall be entitled to a reduction in the purchase price (or rebate as appropriate) of 10 per centum: 
Provided
, That no person who has purchased a house under the Act of 
May 25, 1948
 (
62 Stat. 268
), shall be eligible for such reduction.






“(c)
 Where the Secretary determines that property authorized to be sold under subsection (a) of this section is substandard, he shall sell such property only for off-site use, such property to be opened to bids from the general public for sale to the highest responsible bidder.


“(d)
 The appraised value of all property to be sold under subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, and of all lots leased or to be leased by the United States for the purpose of maintaining, locating, or erecting permanent structures thereon, shall be determined by an appraiser or appraisers to be designated by the Administrator of Housing and Home Finance Agency at the request of the Secretary. Said appraisals shall be made promptly after the date of this Act, or immediately prior to the granting of any lease of lands not previously appraised, as the case may be. The representatives of the Boulder City community, as determined by the Secretary, shall be granted an opportunity to offer advice in connection with [sic] such appraisals.”

 Mortgage insurance for condominiums
(a)
 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to provide an additional means of increasing the supply of privately owned dwelling units where, under the laws of the State in which the property is located, real property title and ownership are established with respect to a one-family unit which is part of a multifamily project.




(b)
 Definitions
The terms “mortgage”, “mortgagee”, “mortgagor”, “maturity date”, and “State” shall have the meanings respectively set forth in 
section 1707 of this title
, except that the term “mortgage” for the purposes of subsection (c) of this section may include a first mortgage given to secure the unpaid purchase price of a fee interest in, or a long-term leasehold interest in, a one-family unit in a multifamily project, including a project in which the dwelling units are attached, semi-attached, or detached, and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project where the mortgage is determined by the Secretary to be eligible for insurance under this section. The term “common areas and facilities” as used in this section shall be deemed to include the land and such commercial, community, and other facilities as are approved by the Secretary.




(c)
 Authorization; eligibility for insurance; conditions; limits
The Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe (including the minimum number of family units in the project which shall be offered for sale and provisions for the protection of the consumer and the public interest), to insure any mortgage covering a one-family unit in a multifamily project and an undivided interest in the common areas and facilities which serve the project, if (1) the mortgage meets the requirements of this subsection and of 
section 1709(b) of this title
, except as that section is modified by this subsection, (2) at least 80 percent of the units in the project covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter are occupied by the mortgagors or comortgagors, and (3) the project has a blanket mortgage insured by the Secretary under subsection (d).

The mortgagor shall have exclusive right to the use of the one-family unit covered by the mortgage and, together with the owners of other units in the multifamily project, shall have the right to the use of the common areas and facilities serving the project and the obligation of maintaining all such common areas and facilities. The Secretary may require that the rights and obligations of the mortgagor and the owners of other dwelling units in the project shall be subject to such controls as he determines to be necessary and feasible to promote and protect individual owners, the multifamily project, and its occupants. For the purposes of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe to permit one-family units and interests in common areas and facilities in multifamily projects covered by mortgages insured under any section of this chapter (other than section 1715e(a)(1) and (2) of this title) to be released from the liens of those mortgages.

In addition to individual mortgages insured under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary is authorized, in his discretion and under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, to insure blanket mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which cover multifamily projects to be constructed or rehabilitated in cases where the mortgage is held by a mortgagor, approved by the Secretary, which—
(1)
 has certified to the Secretary, as a condition of obtaining the insurance of a blanket mortgage under this subsection, that upon completion of the multifamily project covered by such mortgage it intends to commit the ownership of the multifamily project to a plan of family unit ownership under which each family unit would be eligible for individual mortgage insurance under subsection (c) of this section and will faithfully and diligently make and carry out all reasonable efforts to establish such plan of family unit ownership and to sell such family units to purchasers approved by the Secretary; and




(2)
 may, in the Secretary’s discretion, be regulated or restricted as to rents, charges, capital structure, rate of return, and methods of operation until the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance and during such further period of time as the Secretary shall be the owner, holder or reinsurer of the mortgage. The Secretary may make such contracts with and acquire for not to exceed $100 such stock or interest in such mortgagor as he may deem necessary to render effective any such regulation or restriction of such mortgagor. The stock or interest acquired by the Secretary shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par at any time upon the request of the Secretary after the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.




(e)
 Eligibility for insurance of blanket mortgages of multifamily projects

(1)
 For the purpose of assisting lower income families in acquiring homeownership or in acquiring membership in a cooperative association operating a housing project, the Secretary is authorized to make, and to contract to make, periodic assistance payments on behalf of such homeowners and cooperative members. The assistance shall be accomplished through payments to mortgagees holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section or which mortgages are assisted under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance or tax abatement. In making such assistance available, the Secretary shall give preference to low-income families who, without such assistance, would be likely to be involuntarily displaced (including those who would be likely to be displaced from rental units which are to be converted into a condominium project or a cooperative project). Such assistance may include the acquisition of a condominium or a membership in a cooperative association.




(2)
(A)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary is authorized to make periodic assistance payments under this section on behalf of families whose incomes do not exceed the maximum income limits prescribed pursuant to subsection (h)(2) of this section for the purpose of assisting such families in acquiring ownership of a manufactured home consisting of two or more modules and a lot on which such manufactured home is or will be situated, except that periodic assistance payments pursuant to this paragraph shall not be made with respect to more than 20 per centum of the total number of units with respect to which assistance is approved under this section after

(ii)
 the difference between the amount of the monthly payment for principal, interest, and insurance premium chargeable under 
section 1703 of this title
 which the manufactured homeowner is obligated to pay under the loan or advance of credit and the monthly payment of principal and interest which the owner would be obligated to pay if the loan or advance of credit were to bear interest at a rate derived by subtracting from the interest rate applicable to such loan or advance of credit the interest rate differential between the maximum interest rate plus mortgage insurance premium applicable to mortgages insured under subsection (i) of this section at the time such loan or advance of credit is made and the interest rate which such mortgages are presumed, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to bear for purposes of subsection (c)(2) of this section.

Provided
, That if any cooperative member who has received assistance payments transfers his membership and occupancy rights to another person who satisfies the eligibility requirements prescribed by the Secretary and undertakes the obligation to pay occupancy charges, the new cooperative member may qualify for assistance payments upon the filing of an application with respect to the dwelling unit involved to be occupied by him: 
Provided further
, That assistance payments may be made with respect to a dwelling unit in an existing cooperative project which meets such standards as the Secretary may prescribe, if the family qualifies as a displaced family as defined in section 1715

Provided further
, That the Secretary is authorized to continue making such assistance payments where the mortgage has been assigned to the Secretary. Assistance payments pursuant to any new contract, other than a contract in connection with a refinancing under subsection (r) of this section, entered into after 
September 30, 1983
, that utilizes authority approved in appropriation Acts for any fiscal year beginning after such date may not be made for more than a 10-year period. The payment shall be in an amount not exceeding the lesser of—

 holding mortgages meeting the special requirements specified in this section.




(b)
 Restrictions on payments; payments with respect to projects financed under State or local programs; mortgage insurance premium
Interest reduction payments with respect to a project shall only be made during such time as the project is operated as a rental housing proj­ect and is subject to a mortgage which meets the requirements of, and is insured under, subsection (j) of this section:

 entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a State or local program providing assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatements, and which may involve either new or existing construction and which is approved for receiving the benefits of this section. The term “mortgage insurance premium”, when used in this section in relation to a project financed by a loan under a State or local program, means such fees and charges, approved by the Secretary, as are payable by the mortgagor to the State or local agency mortgagee to meet reserve requirements and administrative expenses of such agency.




(c)
 Amount of payments
The interest reduction payments to a mortgagee by the Secretary on behalf of a project owner shall be in an amount not exceeding the difference between the monthly payment for principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the project owner as a mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage and the monthly payment for principal and interest such project owner would be obligated to pay if the mortgage were to bear interest at the rate of 1 per centum per annum.




(d)
 Mortgage handling expenses
The Secretary may include in the payment to the mortgagee such amount, in addition to the amount computed under subsection (c) of this section, as he deems appropriate to reimburse the mortgagee for its expenses in handling the mortgage.




(e)

(1)
 As a condition for receiving the benefits of interest reduction payments, the project owner shall operate the project in accordance with such requirements with respect to tenant eligibility and rents as the Secretary may prescribe. Procedures shall be adopted by the Secretary for review of tenant incomes at intervals of one year (or at shorter intervals where the Secretary deems it desirable).




(2)
 A project for which interest reduction payments are made under this section and for which the mortgage on the project has been refinanced shall continue to receive the interest reduction payments under this section under the terms of the contract for such payments, but only if the project owner enters into such binding commitments as the Secretary may require (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration that is not less than the term for which such interest reduction payments are made plus an additional 5 years.




(f)
 Establishment of basic and fair market rental charges; rental for dwelling units; separate utility metering; additional assistance payments for low-income tenants; limitations; amounts; approval of payments
(1)
(A)
(i)
 For each dwelling unit there shall be established, with the approval of the Secretary, a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge.




(ii)
 The basic rental charge shall be—
(I)
 the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal and interest due under a mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 1 percent per annum; or




(II)
 an amount greater than that determined under clause (ii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit, reduced by the value of the interest reduction payments subsidy.






(iii)
 The fair market rental charge shall be—
(I)
 the amount needed to operate the project with payments of principal, interest, and mortgage insurance premium which the mortgagor is obligated to pay under the mortgage covering the project; or




(II)
 an amount greater than that determined under clause (iii)(I), but not greater than the market rent for a comparable unassisted unit.






(iv)
 The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit that exceeds the minimum amounts permitted by this subparagraph for such charges only if—
(I)
 the approved basic rental charge and fair market rental charges each exceed the applicable minimum charge by the same amount; and




(II)
 the project owner agrees to restrictions on project use or mortgage prepayment that are acceptable to the Secretary.






(v)
 The Secretary may approve a basic rental charge and fair market rental charge under this paragraph for a unit with assistance under 
section 1437f of title 42
 that differs from the basic rental charge and fair market rental charge for a unit in the same project that is similar in size and amenities but without such assistance, as needed to ensure equitable treatment of tenants in units without such assistance.






(B)
(i)
 The rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the basic rental charge or such greater amount, not exceeding the fair market rental charge determined pursuant to subparagraph (A), as represents 30 percent of the tenant’s adjusted income, except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph.




(ii)
 In the case of a project which contains more than 5000 units, is subject to an interest reduction payments contract, and is financed under a State or local project, the Secretary may reduce the rental charge ceiling, but in no case shall the rental charge be below the basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I).




(iii)
 For plans of action approved for capital grants under the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [
12 U.S.C. 4101
 et seq.] or the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, the rental charge for each dwelling unit shall be at the minimum basic rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I) or such greater amount, not exceeding the lower of: (I) the fair market rental charge set forth in subparagraph (A)(iii)(I); or (II) the actual rent paid for a comparable unit in comparable unassisted housing in the market area in which the housing assisted under this section is located, as represents 30 percent of the tenant’s adjusted income.






(C)
 With respect to those projects which the Secretary determines have separate utility metering paid by the tenants for some or all dwelling units, the Secretary may—
(i)
 permit the basic rental charge and the fair market rental charge to be determined on the basis of operating the project without the payment of the cost of utility services used by such dwelling units; and




(ii)
 permit the charging of a rental for such dwelling units at such an amount less than 30 percent of a tenant’s adjusted income as the Secretary determines represents a proportionate decrease for the utility charges to be paid by such tenant, but in no case shall rental be lower than 25 percent of a tenant’s adjusted income.








(2)
 With respect to 20 per centum of the dwelling units in any project made subject to a contract under this section after 
August 22, 1974
, the Secretary shall make, and contract to make, additional assistance payments to the project owner on behalf of tenants whose incomes are too low for them to afford the basic rentals (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) with 30 per centum of their adjusted income. The additional assistance payments authorized by this paragraph with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the amount required to reduce the rental payment (including the amount allowed for utilities in the case of a project with separate utility metering) by the tenant to the highest of the following amounts, rounded to the nearest dollar:
(A)
 30 per centum of the tenant’s monthly adjusted income;




(B)
 10 per centum of the tenant’s monthly income; or




(C)
 if the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of such payments, adjusted in accordance with the family’s actual housing costs, is specifically designated by such agency to meet the family’s housing costs, the portion of such payments which is so designated.





Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the Secretary may—


(A)
 reduce such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary to assure the economic viability of the project; or




(B)
 increase such 20 per centum requirement in the case of any project if he determines that such action is necessary and feasible in order to assure, insofar as is practicable, that there is in the project a reasonable range in the income levels of tenants, or that such action is to be taken to meet the housing needs of elderly or handicapped families.






(3)
 The Secretary shall utilize amounts credited to the fund described in subsection (g) of this section for the sole purpose of carrying out the purposes of section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978. No payments may be made from such fund unless approved in an appropriation Act. No amount may be so approved for any fiscal year beginning after 
September 30, 1994
.




(4)
 To ensure that eligible tenants occupying that number of units with respect to which assistance was being provided under this subsection immediately prior to 
November 30, 1983
, receive the benefit of assistance contracted for under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall offer annually to amend contracts entered into under this subsection with owners of projects assisted but not subject to mortgages insured under this section to provide sufficient payments to cover 100 percent of the necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of eligible tenants, subject to the availability of authority for such purpose under 
section 1437c(c) of title 42
. The Secretary shall take such actions as may be necessary to ensure that payments, including payments that reflect necessary rent increases and changes in the incomes of tenants, are made on a timely basis for all units covered by contracts entered into under paragraph (2).




(5)
(A)
 In order to induce advances by owners for capital improvements (excluding any owner contributions that may be required by the Secretary as a condition for assistance under section 201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978) to benefit projects assisted under this section, in establishing basic rental charges and fair market rental charges under paragraph (1) the Secretary may include an amount that would permit a return of such advances with interest to the owner out of project income, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine. Any resulting increase in rent contributions shall be—
(i)
 to a level not exceeding the lower of 30 percent of the adjusted income of the tenant or the published existing fair market rent for comparable housing established under 
section 1437f(c) of title 42
;




(ii)
 phased in equally over a period of not less than 3 years, if such increase is 30 percent or more; and




(iii)
 limited to not more than 10 percent per year if such increase is more than 10 percent but less than 30 percent.






(B)
 Assistance under 
section 1437f of title 42

(2)
 Notwithstanding any other requirements of this subsection, a project owner may retain some or all of such excess charges for project use if authorized by the Secretary. Such excess charges shall be used for the project and upon terms and conditions established by the Secretary, unless the Secretary permits the owner to retain funds for non-project use after a determination that the project is well-maintained housing in good condition and that the owner has not engaged in material adverse financial or managerial actions or omissions as described in section 516 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. In connection with the retention of funds for non-project use, the Secretary may require the project owner to enter into a binding commitment (which shall be applicable to any subsequent owner) to ensure that the owner will continue to operate the project in accordance with all low-income affordability restrictions for the project in connection with the Federal assistance for the project for a period having a duration of not less than the term of the existing affordability restrictions plus an additional 5 years.




(3)
 The Secretary shall not withhold approval of the retention by the owner of such excess charges because of the existence of unpaid excess charges if such unpaid amount is being remitted to the Secretary over a period of time in accordance with a workout agreement with the Secretary, unless the Secretary determines that the owner is in violation of the workout agreement.




(h)
 Rules and regulations

(2)
 The owner of a project receiving assistance for capital improvements shall agree to contribute assistance to such project in such amounts, from such sources, and in such manner as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.




(3)

(2)
 In order to minimize any increases in rental payments that may occur as a result of the debt service and other expenses of a loan for capital improvements provided under this section for a project and that would be incurred by lower income residents of the project involved whose rental payments are, or would as a result of such expenses be, in excess of the amount allowable if section 3(a) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [

 Declaration of purposes of subchapter
 Repealed. 
 Partition of Federal National Mortgage Association into Federal National Mortgage Association and Government National Mortgage Association; assets and liabilities; operations
The purposes of this title include the partition of the Federal National Mortgage Association as heretofore existing into two separate and distinct corporations, each of which shall have continuity and corporate succession as a separated portion of the previously existing corporation. One of such corporations, to be known as Federal National Mortgage Association, will be a Government-sponsored private corporation, will retain the assets and liabilities of the previously existing corporation accounted for under 
“(a)
 No cause of action by or against the Federal National Mortgage Association existing prior to the effective date established pursuant to section 808 [set out above] shall abate by reason of the enactment of this title. Any such cause of action may thereafter be asserted by or against the appropriate corporate body named in section 302(a)(2) of the National Housing Act [
section 1717(a)(2) of this title
].


“(b)
 No suit, action, or other proceeding commenced by or against the Federal National Mortgage Association, or any officer thereof in his official capacity, prior to the effective date established pursuant to section 808 shall abate by reason of the enactment of this title. A court may at any time thereafter during the pendency of any such litigation, on its own motion or that of any party, order that the litigation may be maintained by or against the appropriate corporate body named in section 302(a)(2) of the National Housing Act [
section 1717(a)(2) of this title
] or the appropriate corresponding officer thereof.”


“(a)
 On the effective date established pursuant to section 808 of this Act [set out above], each share of outstanding nonvoting common stock, with a par value of $100 per share, of the Federal National Mortgage Association shall be changed into and shall become one share of voting common stock, without par value, of such corporation. For the purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954, Title 26], no gain or loss is recognized by the holders of such stock on such change, and the basis and holding period of such stock in the hands of the stockholders immediately after such change are the same as the basis and holding period of such stock in their hands immediately prior to such change.

“(d)
 Those persons who are the officers and employees of the Federal National Mortgage Association immediately prior to the effective date established pursuant to section 808 [set out as a note above] shall become the officers and employees of the Government National Mortgage Association on such date. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Government National Mortgage Association shall provide by contract for the conditions and methods under which and by which the Federal National Mortgage Association during the transitional period may employ those individuals who are employees of the Government National Mortgage Association on such effective date; and may provide by contract for the operation by either of such corporations of any of the functions of the other. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall make every reasonable effort to place in other comparable Federal positions any individuals who are career or career-conditional employees of the Government National Mortgage Association on such effective date and who are subsequently during the transitional period neither employed by the Federal National Mortgage Association nor retained by the Government National Mortgage Association.”


 Federal National Mortgage Association and Government National Mortgage Association
(a)
 Creation; succession; principal and other offices
(1)
 There is created a body corporate to be known as the “Federal National Mortgage Association”, which shall be in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Association shall have succession until dissolved by Act of Congress. It shall maintain its principal office in the District of Columbia and shall be deemed, for purposes of venue in civil actions, to be a resident thereof. Agencies or offices may be established by the Association in such other place or places as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the conduct of its business.




(2)
 On 
September 1, 1968
, the body corporate described in the foregoing paragraph shall cease to exist in that form and is hereby partitioned into two separate and distinct bodies corporate, each of which shall have continuity and corporate succession as a separated portion of the previously existing body corporate, as follows:
(A)
 One of such separated portions shall be a body corporate without capital stock to be known as Government National Mortgage Association (hereinafter referred to as the “Association”), which shall be in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and which shall retain the assets and liabilities acquired and incurred under sections 1720

 and 1721 of this title prior to such date, including any and all liabilities incurred pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. The Association shall have succession until dissolved by Act of Congress. It shall maintain its principal office in the District of Columbia and shall be deemed, for purposes of venue in civil actions, to be a resident thereof. Agencies or offices may be established by the Association in such other place or places as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the conduct of its business.




(B)
 The other such separated portion shall be a body corporate to be known as Federal National Mortgage Association (hereinafter referred to as the “corporation”), which shall retain the assets and liabilities acquired and incurred under sections 1718 and 1719 of this title prior to such date. The corporation shall have succession until dissolved by Act of Congress. It shall maintain its principal office in the District of Columbia or the metropolitan area thereof and shall be deemed, for purposes of jurisdiction and venue in civil actions, to be a District of Columbia corporation.






(3)
 The partition transaction effected pursuant to the foregoing paragraph constitutes a reorganization within the meaning of 
section 368(a)(1)(E) of title 26
; and for the purposes of such title 26, no gain or loss is recognized by the previously existing body corporate by reason of the partition, and the basis and holding period of the assets of the corporation immediately following such partition are the same as the basis and holding period of such assets immediately prior to such partition.




(b)
 Purchase and sale of insured and conventional mortgages; transactions in loans and advances of credit
(1)
 For the purposes set forth in 
section 1716 of this title
 and subject to the limitations and restrictions of this subchapter, each of the bodies corporate named in subsection (a)(2) of this section is authorized pursuant to commitments or otherwise, to purchase, service, sell, or otherwise deal in any mortgages which are insured under this chapter or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [
42 U.S.C. 1471
 et seq.], or which are insured or guaranteed under the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 or chapter 37 of title 38; and to purchase, service, sell, or otherwise deal in any loans made or guaranteed under part B of title VI of the Public Health Service Act [
42 U.S.C. 291j–1
 et seq.]; and the corporation is authorized to lend on the security of any such mortgages and to purchase, sell, or otherwise deal in any securities guaranteed by the Association under 
section 1721(g) of this title
: 
Provided
, That (1) the Association may not purchase any mortgage at a price exceeding 100 per centum of the unpaid principal amount thereof at the time of purchase, with adjustments for interest and any comparable items; (2) the Association may not purchase any mortgage, except a mortgage insured under title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [
42 U.S.C. 1471
 et seq.], if it is offered by, or covers property held by, a State, territorial, or municipal instrumentality; and (3) the Association may not purchase any mortgage under section 1720 
1
 of this title, except a mortgage insured under 
section 1715k of this title
 or subchapter VIII of this chapter or 
section 1709(k) of this title
, or under subchapter IX–A 
1
 of this chapter with respect to a new community approved under section 1749cc–1 
1
 of this title, or insured under 
section 1715e of this title
 and covering property located in an urban renewal area, or a mortgage covering property located in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii, if the original principal obligation thereof exceeds or exceeded $55,000 in the case of property upon which is located a dwelling designed principally for a one-family residence; or $60,000 in the case of a two- or three-family residence; or $68,750 in the case of a four-family residence; or, in the case of a property containing more than four dwelling units, $38,000 per dwelling unit (or such higher amount not in excess of $45,000 per dwelling unit as the Secretary may by regulation specify in any geographical area where the Secretary finds that cost levels so require) for that part of the property attributable to dwelling use. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (3) of the preceding sentence, the Association may purchase a mortgage under section 1720 
1
 of this title with an original principal obligation which exceeds the otherwise applicable maximum amount per dwelling unit if the mortgage is insured under section 1713(c)(3), 1715e(b)(2), 1715k(d)(3)(B)(iii), 1715
l
(d)(3)(ii), 1715
l
(d)(4)(ii), 1715v(c)(2), 1715y(e)(3), or 1715z–1 of this title. For the purposes of this subchapter, the terms “mortgages” and “home mortgages” shall be inclusive of any mortgages or other loans insured under any of the provisions of this chapter or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 [
42 U.S.C. 1471
 et seq.].




(2)
 For the purposes set forth in 
section 1716(a) of this title
, the corporation is authorized, pursuant to commitments or otherwise, to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, or otherwise deal in mortgages which are not insured or guaranteed as provided in paragraph (1) (such mortgages referred to hereinafter as “conventional mortgages”). No such purchase of a conventional mortgage secured by a property comprising one- to four-family dwelling units shall be made if the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage at the time of purchase exceeds 80 per centum of the value of the property securing the mortgage, unless (A) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; (B) for such period and under such circumstances as the corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the corporation in the event that the mortgage is in default; or (C) that portion of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage which is in excess of such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the corporation. The corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a conventional mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (A) of such sentence. The corporation may purchase a conventional mortgage which was originated more than one year prior to the purchase date only if the seller is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Resolution Trust Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, or any other seller currently engaged in mortgage lending or investing activities. For the purpose of this section, the term “conventional mortgages” shall include a mortgage, lien, or other security interest on the stock or membership certificate issued to a tenant-stockholder or resident-member of a cooperative housing corporation, as defined in 
section 216 of title 26
, and on the proprietary lease, occupancy agreement, or right of tenancy in the dwelling unit of the tenant-stockholder or resident-member in such cooperative housing corporation. The corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of conventional mortgages that are purchased by it; in any case in which the corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of the mortgage and not merely with respect to the interest purchased by the corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed $417,000 for a mortgage secured by a single-family residence, $533,850 for a mortgage secured by a 2-family residence, $645,300 for a mortgage secured by a 3-family residence, and $801,950 for a mortgage secured by a 4-family residence, except that such maximum limitations shall be adjusted effective January 1 of each year beginning after the effective date of the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008, subject to the limitations in this paragraph. Each adjustment shall be made by adding to each such amount (as it may have been previously adjusted) a percentage thereof equal to the percentage increase, during the most recent 12-month or 4-quarter period ending before the time of determining such annual adjustment, in the housing price index maintained by the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (pursuant to 
section 4542 of this title
). If the change in such house price index during the most recent 12-month or 4-quarter period ending before the time of determining such annual adjustment is a decrease, then no adjustment shall be made for the next year, and the next adjustment shall take into account prior declines in the house price index, so that any adjustment shall reflect the net change in the house price index since the last adjustment. Declines in the house price index shall be accumulated and then reduce increases until subsequent increases exceed prior declines. The foregoing limitations may be increased by not to exceed 50 per centum with respect to properties located in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, and the Virgin Islands. Such foregoing limitations shall also be increased, with respect to properties of a particular size located in any area for which 115 percent of the median house price for such size residence exceeds the foregoing limitation for such size residence, to the lesser of 150 percent of such limitation for such size residence or the amount that is equal to 115 percent of the median house price in such area for such size residence.




(3)
 The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in loans or advances of credit for the purchase and installation of home improvements, including energy conserving improvements or solar energy systems described in the last paragraph of 
section 1703(a) of this title
 and residential energy conservation measures as described in section 210(11) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [
42 U.S.C. 8211(11)
] 
1
 and financed by a public utility in accordance with the requirements of title II of such Act [
42 U.S.C. 8211
 et seq.]. To be eligible for purchase, any such loan or advance of credit (other than a loan or advance made with respect to energy conserving improvements or solar energy systems or residential energy conservation measures) not insured under subchapter I of this chapter shall be secured by a lien against the property to be improved.




(4)
 The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in loans or advances of credit secured by mortgages or other liens against manufactured homes.




(5)
(A)
 The corporation is authorized to purchase, service, sell, lend on the security of, and otherwise deal in (i) conventional mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a one- to four-family residence that is the principal residence of the mortgagor; and (ii) conventional mortgages that are secured by a subordinate lien against a property comprising five or more family dwelling units. If the corporation, pursuant to paragraphs (1) through (4), shall have purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with any other outstanding mortgage secured by the same residence, the aggregate original amount of such other mortgage and the mortgage authorized to be purchased, serviced, sold, or otherwise dealt with under this paragraph shall not exceed the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).




(B)
 The corporation shall establish limitations governing the maximum original principal obligation of conventional mortgages described in subparagraph (A). In any case in which the corporation purchases a participation interest in such a mortgage, the limitation shall be calculated with respect to the total original principal obligation of such mortgage described in subparagraph (A) and not merely with respect to the interest purchased by the corporation. Such limitations shall not exceed (i) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(i), 50 per centum of the single-family residence mortgage limitation determined under paragraph (2); and (ii) with respect to mortgages described in subparagraph (A)(ii), the applicable limitation determined under paragraph (2).




(C)
 No subordinate mortgage against a one- to four-family residence shall be purchased by the corporation if the total outstanding indebtedness secured by the property as a result of such mortgage exceeds 80 per centum of the value of such property unless (i) that portion of such total outstanding indebtedness that exceeds such 80 per centum is guaranteed or insured by a qualified insurer as determined by the corporation; (ii) the seller retains a participation of not less than 10 per centum in the mortgage; or (iii) for such period and under such circumstances as the corporation may require, the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the mortgage upon demand of the corporation in the event that the mortgage is in default. The corporation shall not issue a commitment to purchase a subordinate mortgage prior to the date the mortgage is originated, if such mortgage is eligible for purchase under the preceding sentence only by reason of compliance with the requirements of clause (ii) of such sentence.






(6)
 The corporation may not implement any new program (as such term is defined in 
section 4502 of this title
) before obtaining the approval of the Secretary under section 4542 
1
 of this title.




(c)
 Administration of trusts; obligations of departments and agencies of the United States; exemption of interest income from taxation; authorization of appropriations for differential reimbursements
(1)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or of any other law, the Association is authorized under 
section 1721 of this title
 to create, accept, execute, and otherwise administer in all respects such trusts, receiverships, conservatorships, liquidating or other agencies, or other fiduciary and representative undertakings and activities, hereinafter in this subsection called “trusts”, as might be appropriate for financing purposes; and in relation thereto the Association may acquire, hold and manage, dispose of, and otherwise deal in any mortgages or other types of obligations in which any department or agency of the United States listed in paragraph (2) of this subsection may have a financial interest. The Association may join in any such undertakings and activities, hereinafter in this subsection called “trusts”; notwithstanding that it is also serving in a fiduciary or representative capacity; and is authorized to guarantee any participations or other instruments, whether evidence of property rights or debt, issued for such financing purposes. Participations or other instruments issued by the Association pursuant to this subsection shall to the same extent as securities which are direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States be deemed to be exempt securities within the meaning of laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amounts of any mortgages and their obligations acquired by the Association under 
section 1721 of this title
, pursuant to this subsection, shall not be included in the total amounts set forth in 
section 1721(c) of this title
.




(2)
 Subject to the limitations provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection, one or more trusts may be established as provided in this subsection by each of the following departments or agencies:
(A)
 The Farmers Home Administration of the Department of Agriculture, but only with respect to operating loans, direct farm ownership loans, direct housing loans, and direct soil and water loans. Such trusts may not be established with respect to loans for housing for the elderly under sections 502 and 515(a) of the Housing Act of 1949 [
42 U.S.C. 1472
 and 1485(a)], nor with respect to loans for nonfarm recreational development.




(B)
 The Department of Education, but only with respect to loans made by the Secretary of Education for construction of academic facilities, and loans to help finance student loan programs.




(C)
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development.




(D)
 The Department of Veterans Affairs.




(E)
 The Export-Import Bank.




(F)
 The Small Business Administration.





The head of each such department or agency, hereinafter in this subsection called the “trustor,” is authorized to set aside a part or all of any obligations held by the trustor and subject them to a trust or trusts and, incident thereto, shall guarantee to the trustee timely payment thereof. The trust instrument may provide for the issuance and sale of beneficial interests or participations, by the trustee, in such obligations or in the right to receive interest and principal collections therefrom; and may provide for the substitution or withdrawal of such obligations, or for the substitution of cash for obligations. The trust or trusts shall be exempt from all taxation. The trust instrument may also contain other appropriate provisions in keeping with the purposes of this subsection. The Association shall be named and shall act as trustee of any such trusts and, for the purposes thereof, the title to such obligations shall be deemed to have passed to the Association in trust. The trust instrument shall provide that custody, control, and administration of the obligations shall remain in the trustor subjecting the obligations to the trust, subject to transfer to the trustee in event of default or probable default, as determined by the trustee, in the payment of principal and interest of the beneficial interests or participations. Collections from obligations subject to the trust shall be dealt with as provided in the instrument creating the trust. The trust instrument shall provide that the trustee will promptly pay to the trustor the full net proceeds of any sale of beneficial interests or participations to the extent they are based upon such obligations or collections. Such proceeds shall be dealt with as otherwise provided by law for sales or repayment of such obligations. The effect of both past and future sales of any issue of beneficial interests or participations shall be the same, to the extent of the principal of such issue, as the direct sale with recourse of the obligations subject to the trust. Any trustor creating a trust or trusts hereunder is authorized to purchase, through the facilities of the trustee, outstanding beneficial interests or participations to the extent of the amount of the trustor’s responsibility to the trustee on beneficial interests or participations outstanding, and to pay the trustor’s proper share of the costs and expenses incurred by the Association as trustee pursuant to the trust instrument.




(3)
 When any trustor guarantees to the trustee the timely payment of obligations the trustor subjects to a trust pursuant to this subsection, and it becomes necessary for such trustor to meet his responsibilities under such guaranty, the trustor is authorized to fulfill such guaranty.




(4)
 Beneficial interests or participations shall not be issued for the account of any trustor in an aggregate principal amount greater than is authorized with respect to such trustor in an appropriation Act. Any such authorization shall remain available only for the fiscal year for which it is granted and for the succeeding fiscal year.




(5)
 The Association, as trustee, is authorized to issue and sell beneficial interests or participations under this subsection, notwithstanding that there may be an insufficiency in aggregate receipts from obligations subject to the related trust to provide for the payment by the trustee (on a timely basis out of current receipts or otherwise) of all interest or principal on such interests or participations (after provision for all costs and expenses incurred by the trustee, fairly prorated among trustors). There are authorized to be appropriated without fiscal year limitation such sums as may be necessary to enable any trustor to pay the trustee such insufficiency as the trustee may require on account of outstanding beneficial interests or participations authorized to be issued pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection. Such trustor shall make timely payments to the trustee from such appropriations, subject to and in accord with the trust instrument. In the event that the insufficiency required by the trustee is on account of principal maturities of outstanding beneficial interests or participations authorized to be issued pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection, or pursuant hereto, the trustee is authorized to elect to issue additional beneficial interests or participations for refinancing purposes in lieu of requiring any trustor or trustors to make payments to the trustee from appropriated funds or other sources. Each such issue of beneficial interests or participations shall be in an amount determined by the trustee but not in excess of the aggregate amount which the trustee would otherwise require the trustor or trustors to pay from appropriated funds or other sources, and may be issued without regard to the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection. All refinancing issues of beneficial interests or participations shall be deemed to have been issued pursuant to the authority contained in the appropriation Act or Acts under which the beneficial interests or participations were originally issued.




 Prohibition against sale of obligations by Federal departments and agencies after 
After 
 Capitalization of Federal National Mortgage Association
(a)
 Common stock; preferred stock; transferability of shares
The corporation shall have common stock, without par value, which shall be vested with all voting rights, each share being entitled to one vote with rights of cumulative voting at all elections of directors. The corporation may eliminate such rights of cumulative voting by a resolution adopted by its board of directors and approved by the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock voting in person or by proxy at the annual meeting, or other special meeting, at which such resolution is considered. The corporation may have preferred stock on such terms and conditions as the board of directors shall prescribe. The free transferability of the stock at all times to any person, firm, corporation, or other entity shall not be restricted except that, as to the corporation, it shall be transferable only on the books of the corporation. The corporation may issue shares of common stock in return for appropriate payments into capital or capital and surplus.




(b)
 Fees and charges; annual transfer of earnings to general surplus account
(1)
 The corporation may impose charges or fees, which may be regarded as elements of pricing, with the objective that all costs and expenses of the operations of the corporation should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting.




(2)
 All earnings from the operations of the corporation shall annually be transferred to the general surplus account of the corporation. At any time, funds of the general surplus account may, in the discretion of the board of directors, be transferred to reserves.




(c)
 Capital distributions from general surplus account; minimum capitalization levels
(1)
 Except as provided in paragraph (2), the corporation may make such capital distributions (as such term is defined in 
section 4502 of this title
) as may be declared by the board of directors. All capital distributions shall be charged against the general surplus account of the corporation.




(2)
 The corporation may not make any capital distribution that would decrease the total capital of the corporation (as such term is defined in 
section 4502 of this title
) to an amount less than the risk-based capital level for the corporation established under 
section 4611 of this title
 or that would decrease the core capital of the corporation (as such term is defined in 
section 4502 of this title
) to an amount less than the minimum capital level for the corporation established under 
section 4612 of this title
, without prior written approval of the distribution by the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.




(d)
 Institutions eligible to purchase stock
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any institution, including a national bank or State member bank of the Federal Reserve System or any member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, trust company, or other banking organization, organized under any law of the United States, including the laws relating to the District of Columbia, shall be authorized to purchase shares of common stock of the corporation and to hold or dispose of such stock, subject to the provisions of this subchapter.

 of 
section 1716 of this title
, the operations of the corporation under this section shall be confined, so far as practicable, to mortgages which are deemed by the corporation to be of such quality, type, and class as to meet, generally, the purchase standards imposed by private institutional mortgage investors. In the interest of assuring sound operation, the prices to be paid by the corporation for mortgages purchased in its secondary market operations under this section, should be established, from time to time, within the range of market prices for the particular class of mortgages involved, as determined by the corporation. The volume of the corporation’s purchases and sales, and the establishment of the purchase prices, sale prices, and charges or fees, in its secondary market operations under this section, should be determined by the corporation from time to time, and such determinations should be consistent with the objectives that such purchases and sales should be effected only at such prices and on such terms as will reasonably prevent excessive use of the corporation’s facilities, and that the operations of the corporation under this section should be within its income derived from such operations and that such operations should be fully self-supporting. Nothing in this subchapter shall prohibit the corporation from purchasing, and making commitments to purchase, any mortgage with respect to which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has entered into a contract with the corporation to make interest subsidy payments under 
section 1715z–8 of this title
.

The Secretary of the Treasury shall not at any time purchase any obligations under this subsection if such purchase would increase the aggregate principal amount of the Secretary’s then outstanding holdings of such obligations under this subsection to an amount greater than $2,250,000,000. Each purchase of obligations by the Secretary of the Treasury under this subsection shall be upon such terms and conditions as to yield a return at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average rate on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States as of the last day of the month preceding the making of such purchase.

October 8, 1980
), shall preclude or limit the exercise by the Association of (A) its power to contract with the issuer on the terms stated in the preceding sentence, (B) its rights to enforce any such contract with the issuer, or (C) its ownership rights, as provided in the preceding sentence, in the mortgages constituting the trust or pool against which the guaranteed securities are issued. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all amounts which may be required to be paid under any guaranty under this subsection. There shall be excluded from the total amounts set forth in subsection (c) of this section the amounts of any mortgages acquired by the Association as a result of its operations under this subsection.

 et seq.].




(B)
 The fees charged for the guaranty of securities or on notes based on or backed by mortgages not referred to in subparagraph (A), as authorized by other provisions of law, shall be set by the Association at a level not more than necessary to create reserves sufficient to meet anticipated claims based upon actuarial analysis, and for no other purpose.




(C)
 Fees or charges for the issuance of commitments or miscellaneous administrative fees of the Association shall not be on a competitive auction basis and shall remain at the level set for such fees or charges as of 
September 1, 1985
, except that such fees or charges may be increased if reasonably related to the cost of administering the program, and for no other purpose.




(D)
 Not less than 90 days before increasing any fee or charge under subparagraph (B) or (C), the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a certification that such increase is solely for the purpose specified in such subparagraph.

 Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) through (D), fees charged for the guarantee of, or commitment to guarantee, multiclass securities backed by a trust or pool of securities or notes guaranteed by the Association under this subsection, and other related fees shall be charged by the Association in an amount the Association deems appropriate. The Association shall take such action as may be necessary to reasonably assure that such portion of the benefit, resulting from the Association’s multiclass securities program, as the Association determines is appropriate accrues to mortgagors who execute eligible mortgages after 
August 10, 1993
.




(ii)
 The Association shall provide for the initial implementation of the program for which fees are charged under the first sentence of clause (i) by notice published in the Federal Register. The notice shall be effective upon publication and shall provide an opportunity for public comment.

(iv)
 No State or local law, and no Federal law (except Federal law enacted expressly in limitation of this clause after

To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall—
(1)
 have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;




(2)
 involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary’s estimate of the value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance), except that as to applications received by the Secretary on or before 
March 31, 1948
, the mortgage may involve a principal obligation in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the Secretary’s estimate of the necessary current cost (including the land and such initial service charges and such appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve); of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than four families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall in no event, however, exceed—

 $5,400 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or




(B)
 $7,500 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence, or

(4)
 contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;




(5)
 bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4 per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;

 Mortgage insurance benefits
(a)
 Conveyance and assignment by mortgagee after foreclosure; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure
In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under 
section 1738 of this title
 shall have foreclosed and taken possession of the mortgaged property, in accordance with regulations of, and within a period to be determined by, the Secretary, or shall, with the consent of the Secretary, have otherwise acquired such property from the mortgagor after default, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefit of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon (1) the prompt conveyance to the Secretary of title to the property which meets the requirements of rules and regulations of the Secretary in force at the time the mortgage was insured, and which is evidenced in the manner prescribed by such rules and regulations; and (2) the assignment to him of all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except such claims as may have been released with the consent of the Secretary. Upon such conveyance and assignment the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for insurance shall cease and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment hereinafter provided, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage and a certificate of claim, as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings, or on the date of the acquisition of the property after default other than by foreclosure, the amount of all payments which have been made by the mortgagee for taxes, ground rents, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage, special assessments which are noted on the application for insurance or which become liens after the insurance of the mortgage, insurance of the mortgaged property, and any mortgage insurance premiums and by deducting from such total amount any amount received on account of the mortgage after either of such dates, and any amount received as rent or other income from the property, less reasonable expenses incurred in handling the property, after either of such dates: 
Provided
, That with respect to mortgages which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount—
(1)
 not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings and not in excess of $75; or




(2)
 not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: 
Provided further
, That with respect to any debentures issued on or after 
September 2, 1964
, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: 
And provided further
, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50 
1

 See References in Text note below.
 apply and which are insured under 
section 1738 of this title
 and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter.




(b)
 Consent to release of mortgagee or property
The Secretary may at any time, under such terms and conditions as he may prescribe, consent to the release of the mortgagor from his liability under the mortgage or the credit instrument secured thereby, or consent to the release of parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage: 
Provided
, That the mortgagor shall not be released from such liability in any case until the Secretary is satisfied that the mortgaged property has been sold to a purchaser satisfactory to the Secretary, and that such purchaser has paid on account of the purchase price, in cash or its equivalent, at least 10 per centum of the Secretary’s estimate of the value as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance.




(c)
 Debentures; form and denomination
Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the value of the mortgage determined as herein provided and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $350, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.




(d)
 Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions
The debenture issued under this section to any mortgagee shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date foreclosure proceedings were instituted, or the property was otherwise acquired by the mortgagee after default, except that debentures issued pursuant to claims for insurance filed on or after 
September 2, 1964
, shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the mortgage was accepted for insurance, but not to exceed 3 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages accepted for insurance under this section on or after 
May 26, 1942
, shall mature ten years after the date thereof. Such debentures as are issued in exchange for property covered by mortgages accepted for insurance under this section prior to 
May 26, 1942
, shall mature three years after the 1st day of July following the maturity date of the mortgage on the property in exchange for which the debentures were issued: 
Provided
, That any mortgagee entitled to receive such debentures may elect to receive in lieu thereof debentures which shall mature ten years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, and shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event that the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures issued under this subchapter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.




(e)
 Certificate of claim
The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee shall be for an amount which the Secretary determines to be sufficient, when added to the face value of the debentures issued and the cash adjustment paid to the mortgagee, to equal the amount which the mortgagee would have received if, at the time of the conveyance to the Secretary of the property covered by the mortgage, the mortgagor had redeemed the property and paid in full all obligations under the mortgage and a reasonable amount for necessary expenses incurred by the mortgagee in connection with the foreclosure proceedings, or the acquisition of the mortgaged property otherwise, and the conveyance thereof to the Secretary. Each such certificate of claim shall provide that there shall accrue to the holder of such certificate with respect to the face amount of such certificate, an increment at the rate of 3 per centum per annum which shall not be compounded. The amount to which the holder of any such certificate shall be entitled shall be determined as provided in subsection (f) of this section.




(f)
 Division of excess proceeds
(1)
 If, after deducting (in such manner and amount as the Secretary shall determine to be equitable and in accordance with sound accounting practice) the expenses incurred by the Secretary, the net amount realized from any property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and the claims assigned therewith exceed the face value of the debentures issued and the cash paid in exchange for such property plus all interest paid on such debentures, such excess shall be divided as follows:
(i)
 If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property: 
Provided
, That on and after 
September 2, 1964
, any excess remaining after payment to the holder of the full amount of the certificate of claim shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund; and




(ii)
 If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such excess.






(2)
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized, with the consent of the mortgagee or mortgagor, as the case may be, to effect the settlement of certificates of claim and refunds at any time after the sale or transfer of title to the property conveyed to the Secretary under this section and without awaiting the final liquidation of such property for the purpose of determining the net amount to be realized therefrom: 
Provided
, That the settlement authority created by the Housing Amendments of 1955 shall be terminated with respect to any certificate of claim outstanding as of 
September 2, 1964
.




(3)
 With the consent of the holder thereof, the Secretary is authorized to settle, without awaiting the final liquidation of the Secretary’s interest in the property, any certificate of claim issued pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, with respect to which a settlement had not been effected prior to 
September 2, 1964
, by making payment in cash to the holder thereof of such amount, not exceeding the face amount of the certificate of claim, together with the accrued interest increment thereon, as the Secretary may consider appropriate: 
Provided
, That in any case where the certificate of claim is settled in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, any amounts realized after 
September 2, 1964
, in the liquidation of the Secretary’s interest in the property, shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the applicable insurance fund.

section 1738 of this title
 unless such suit or action is commenced within six months after the assignment of such claim to the Secretary, or within six months after the last payment was made to the Secretary with respect to the claim so assigned, whichever is later:

 Purpose of subchapter; authorization; terms and conditions; expiration of insurance contract

To effectuate this purpose, the Secretary is authorized, upon application by the investor, to insure as hereinafter provided, and, prior to the execution of insurance contracts and upon such terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, to make commitments to insure, the minimum annual amortization charge and an annual return on the outstanding investment of such investor in any project which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided in an amount (herein called the “insured annual return”) equal to such rate of return, not exceeding 2¾ per centum per annum, on such outstanding investment as shall, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, be fixed in the insurance contract or in the commitment to insure: 
 Eligibility for insurance

 For insurance granted pursuant to this subchapter the Secretary shall fix and collect a premium charge in an amount not exceeding one-half of 1 per centum of the outstanding investment for the operating year for which such premium charge is payable without taking into account the excess earnings, if any, applied, in addition to the minimum annual amortization charge, to amortization of the outstanding investment. Such premium charge shall be payable annually in advance by the investor, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest: 
Provided

Prior to approving the initial or any subsequent rent schedule pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall find that such schedule affords reasonable assurance that the rents to be established thereunder are (1) not lower than necessary, together with all other income to be derived from or in connection with the project, to produce reasonably stable revenues sufficient to provide for the payment of the operating expenses, the minimum annual amortization charge, and the minimum annual return; and (2) not higher than necessary to meet the need for dwellings for families of moderate income.
 Excess earnings used for amortization of original investment
For all of the purposes of any insurance contract made pursuant to this subchapter, 50 per centum of the excess earnings, if any, for any operating year may be applied, in addition to the minimum annual return, to return on the outstanding investment but only to the extent that such application thereof does not result in an annual return of more than 5 per centum of the outstanding investment for such operating year, and the balance of any such excess earnings shall be applied, in addition to the minimum annual amortization charge, to amortization of the outstanding investment:

 Insurance of mortgages
(a)
 Aggregate amount of insurance; termination date
In order to assist in relieving the acute shortage and urgent need for family housing which now exists at or in areas adjacent to military installations because of uncertainty as to the permanency of such installations and to increase the supply of necessary family housing accommodations for personnel at such installations, the Secretary is authorized, upon application of the mortgagee, to insure mortgages (including advances on such mortgages during construction) which are eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided, and, upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe, to make commitments for so insuring such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: 
Provided
, That the aggregate amount of principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this subchapter (except mortgages insured pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter in effect prior to 
August 11, 1955
) shall not exceed $2,300,000,000: 
And provided further
, That the limitation in 
section 1715h of this title
 shall not apply to this subchapter: 
And provided further

, pursuant to any mortgage insured under this section after such date.




(b)
 Eligibility for insurance
To be eligible for insurance under this subchapter a mortgage shall meet the following conditions:
(1)
 The mortgaged property shall be held by a mortgagor approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may, in his discretion, require such mortgagor to be regulated or restricted as to capital structure, and methods of operation. The Secretary may make such contracts with, and acquire for not to exceed $100 stock or interest in, any such mortgagor, as the Secretary may deem necessary to render effective such restriction or regulation. Such stock or interest shall be paid for out of the General Insurance Fund, and shall be redeemed by the mortgagor at par upon the termination of all obligations of the Secretary under the insurance.




(2)
 The mortgaged property shall be designed for use for residential purposes by personnel of the armed services and situated at or near a military installation, and the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall have certified that there is no intention, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, to substantially curtail the personnel assigned or to be assigned to such installation, and (i) shall have determined that for reasons of safety, security, or other essential military requirements, it is necessary that the personnel involved reside in public quarters: 
Provided, however
, That for the purposes of this subsection housing covered by a mortgage insured, or for which a commitment to insure has been issued, under this section prior to 
August 11, 1955
, may be considered the same as available quarters, and (ii) with the approval of the Secretary, shall have determined that adequate housing is not available for such personnel at reasonable rentals within reasonable commuting distance of the installation and that the mortgaged property will not, so far as can reasonably be foreseen, substantially curtail occupancy in existing housing covered by mortgages insured under this chapter. The housing accommodations shall comply with such standards and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe to establish the acceptability of such property for mortgage insurance, except that the certification of the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall (for purposes of mortgage insurance under this subchapter) be conclusive evidence to the Secretary of the existence of the need for such housing. However, if the Secretary does not concur in the housing needs as certified by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary may require the Secretary of Defense to guarantee the General Insurance Fund against loss with respect to the mortgage covering such housing. There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to provide for payment to meet losses arising from such guaranty.




(3)
 The mortgage shall involve a principal obligation in an amount—
(A)
 not to exceed the amount which the Secretary estimates will be the replacement cost of the property or project when the proposed improvements are completed (the cost of the property or project as such term is used in this paragraph may include the cost of the land, the physical improvements, and utilities within the boundaries of the property or project);




(B)
 not to exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit for such part of such property or project (including ranges, refrigerators, shades, screens, and fixtures) as may be attributable to dwelling use: 
Provided
, That the replacement cost of the property or project as determined by the Secretary, including the estimated value of any usable utilities within the boundaries of the property or project where owned by the United States and not provided for out of the proceeds of the mortgage, shall not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: 
Provided further
, That should the financing of housing to be constructed pursuant to a single invitation for bids be accomplished by two or more mortgages, the principal obligation of any single mortgage may exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit if the sum of the principal obligations of all mortgages for such housing does not exceed an average of $16,500 per family unit: 
And provided further
, That subject to the limitations of this paragraph no family unit included in any mortgaged property shall be contracted for after 
June 8, 1960
 if the cost of such unit exceeds $19,800; and




(C)
 not to exceed the bid of the eligible bidder with respect to the property or proj­ect under 
section 1594 of title 42
.







The mortgage shall provide for complete amortization by periodic payments within such terms as the Secretary shall prescribe, but not to exceed thirty years from the beginning of amortization of the mortgage, and shall bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) as not to exceed 4½ per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time. The Secretary may consent to the release of a part or parts of the mortgaged property from the lien of the mortgage upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe and the mortgage may provide for such release. The property or project may include such nondwelling facilities as the Secretary deems adequate to serve the occupants.


(c)
 Premium charges
The Secretary is authorized to fix a premium charge for the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter but in the case of any mortgage such charge shall not be less than an amount equivalent to one-half of 1 per centum per annum nor more than an amount equivalent to 1½ per centum per annum of the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at any time, without taking into account delinquent payments or prepayments. Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash, or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: 
Provided
, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds, upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge and such other charges as the Secretary may require, that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. The Secretary may reduce the payment of premiums provided for herein. The Secretary is further authorized to reduce the amount of the premium charge below one-half of 1 per centum per annum with respect to any mortgage on property acquired by the Secretary of Defense or his designee if the mortgage is insured pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter as in effect prior to 
August 11, 1955
.




(d)
 Default by mortgagor; rights of mortgagee
The failure of the mortgagor to make any payment due under or provided to be paid by the terms of a mortgage insured under this subchapter shall be considered a default under such mortgage, and, if such default continues for a period of thirty days, the mortgagee shall be entitled to receive the benefits of the insurance as hereinafter provided, upon assignment, transfer, and delivery to the Secretary, within a period and in accordance with rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of (1) all rights and interest arising under the mortgage so in default; (2) all claims of the mortgagee against the mortgagor or others, arising out of the mortgage transactions; (3) all policies of title or other insurance or surety bonds or other guaranties and any and all claims thereunder; (4) any balance of the mortgage loan not advanced to the mortgagor; (5) any cash or property held by the mortgagee, or to which it is entitled, as deposits made for the account of the mortgagor and which have not been applied in reduction of the principal of the mortgage indebtedness; and (6) all records, documents, books, papers, and accounts relating to the mortgage transaction. Upon such assignment, transfer, and delivery, the obligation of the mortgagee to pay the premium charges for mortgage insurance shall cease, and the Secretary shall, subject to the cash adjustment provided for in subsection (e) of this section, issue to the mortgagee debentures having a total face value equal to the value of the mortgage, and a certificate of claim as hereinafter provided. For the purposes of this subsection, the value of the mortgage shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary, by adding to the amount of the original principal obligation of the mortgage which was unpaid on the date of default, the amount the mortgagee may have paid for (A) taxes, special assessments, and water rates, which are liens prior to the mortgage; (B) insurance on the property; and (C) reasonable expenses for the completion and preservation of the property and any mortgage insurance premiums paid after default; less the sum of (i) any amount received on account of the mortgage after such date; and (ii) any net income received by the mortgagee from the property after such date.

 Debentures; issuance; form and denomination
Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be in such form and denominations in multiples of $50, shall be subject to such terms and conditions, and shall include such provisions for redemption, if any, as may be prescribed by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, and may be in coupon or registered form. Any difference between the value of the mortgage determined as herein provided and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $50, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.




(f)
 Debentures; execution; signature; negotiability; interest rate; tax exemption; guarantee
Debentures issued under this subchapter shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary, by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable. All such debentures shall be dated as of the date of default as determined in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, and shall bear interest from such date at a rate established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1715
o
 of this title, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year, and shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, and gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority. They shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures. In the event the General Insurance Fund fails to pay upon demand, when due, the principal of or interest on any debentures so guaranteed, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to the holders the amount thereof which is authorized to be appropriated, and thereupon to the extent of the amount so paid the Secretary of the Treasury shall succeed to all the rights of the holders of such debentures.




(g)
 Claim certificates
The certificate of claim issued by the Secretary to any mortgagee in connection with the insurance of mortgages under this subchapter shall be for an amount determined in accordance with subsections (e) and (f) of 
section 1739 of this title
, except that any amount remaining after the payment of the full amount under the certificate of claim shall be retained by the Secretary and credited to the General Insurance Fund.

 to subsection (g) shall be construed to refer to subsection (d) of this section.




(i)
 Secretary’s additional powers to insure certain mortgages
The Secretary shall also have power to insure under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter any mortgage executed in connection with the sale by him of any property acquired under this subchapter without regard to any limit as to eligibility, time or aggregate amount contained in this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter.




(j)
 Conclusiveness and validity of insurance contract
Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontest­able in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.




(k)
 Certification as to overtime wages paid to laborers and mechanics
The Secretary shall not insure any mortgage under this section unless the principal contractor or contractors engaged in the construction of the project involved file a certificate or certificates (at such times, in the course of construction or otherwise, as the Secretary may prescribe) certifying that the laborers and mechanics employed in the construction of such project have been paid not less than one and one-half times the regular rate of pay for employment in excess of eight hours in any one day or in excess of forty hours in any one week.

Provided

(e)
 Undertaking
Each mortgage insured under this subchapter shall contain an undertaking (in accordance with regulations prescribed under this subchapter and in force at the time the mortgage is approved for insurance) to the effect that, except as authorized by the Secretary and the mortgagee, the property will be used as a group practice facility or medical practice facility until the mortgage has been paid in full or the contract of insurance otherwise terminated.

Where the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is authorized to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge. This charge shall be in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage had continued to be insured until the maturity date. Where such prepayment occurs, the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid.

 Insurance in critical areas
(a)
 Limitations; termination of certain commitments; requirements; discrimination against children
This subchapter is designed to supplement systems of mortgage insurance under other provisions of this chapter in order to assist in providing adequate housing in areas which the President, pursuant to 
section 1591 of title 42
, shall have determined to be critical defense housing areas. The Secretary is authorized, upon application by the mortgagee, to insure under this section or 
section 1750g of this title
 as hereinafter provided any mortgage which is eligible for insurance as hereinafter provided and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe to make commitments for the insuring of such mortgages prior to the date of their execution or disbursement thereon: 
Provided
, That the property covered by the mortgage is in an area which the President, pursuant to 
section 1591 of title 42
, shall have determined to be a critical defense housing area, and that the total number of dwelling units in properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter in any such area does not exceed the number authorized by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from time to time as needed in such area for defense purposes and to be insured pursuant to this subchapter: 
Provided further
, That in the event the Secretary has issued a commitment to insure a mortgage under this section, which commitment was in force and effect on 
June 1, 1953
, and the Secretary determines that, because of changes in defense requirements, there is reasonable doubt that such housing is needed for defense purposes and that it is probable that the mortgage would become immediately in default and claim made for payment under the mortgage insurance contract if the unit or units are completed and the mortgage insured, the Secretary is authorized, in the interest of conserving the General Insurance Fund, to pay (in cash from the General Insurance Fund) to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor such amount as the Secretary shall determine to be necessary to reimburse the mortgagor the amounts paid or to be paid by the mortgagor on account of labor performed and materials in place, less the Secretary’s estimate of the reasonable salvage value of such materials, plus an allowance for development costs equal to 4 per centum of the principal amount of the mortgage specified in such commitment, and no payments shall be made pursuant to this proviso unless a claim therefor is filed not later than six months from date of the determination of lack of need and the claim is in such form and contains such supporting information, documents, and data as the Secretary may require: 
Provided further

 of this title: 
Provided further
, That the Secretary shall have power to require properties covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter to be held for rental for such periods of time and at such rentals or other charges as he may prescribe; and, with respect to such properties being held for rental, (1) to require that the property be held by a mortgagor approved by him, and (2) to prescribe such requirements as he deems to be reasonable governing the method of operation and prohibiting or restricting sales of such properties or interests therein or agreements relating to such sales: 
Provided further
, That the Secretary shall require each dwelling covered by a mortgage insured under this section, for which a commitment to insure is issued after 
August 2, 1954
, to be held for rental for a period of not less than three years after the dwelling is made available for initial occupancy: 
And provided further
, That no mortgage shall be insured under this subchapter unless the mortgagor certifies under oath that in selecting tenants for any property covered by the mortgage he will not discriminate against any family by reason of the fact that there are children in the family, and that he will not sell the property while the insurance is in effect unless the purchaser so certifies, such certification to be filed with the Secretary. Violation of any such certification shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500.




(b)
 Eligibility requirements
To be eligible for insurance under this section a mortgage shall—
(1)
 have been made to, and be held by, a mortgagee approved by the Secretary as responsible and able to service the mortgage properly;




(2)
 involve a principal obligation (including such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other fees as the Secretary shall approve) in an amount not to exceed 90 per centum of the appraised value (as of the date the mortgage is accepted for insurance) of a property, urban, suburban, or rural, upon which there is located a dwelling designed principally for residential use for not more than two families in the aggregate, which is approved for mortgage insurance prior to the beginning of construction, the construction of which is begun after 
September 1, 1951
. The principal obligation of such mortgage shall not, however, exceed $8,100 if such dwelling is designed for a single-family residence, or $15,000 if such dwelling is designed for a two-family residence except that the Secretary may by regulation increase these amounts to not to exceed $9,000 and $16,000, respectively, in any geographical area where he finds that cost levels so require: 
Provided
, That if the Secretary finds that it is not feasible within the aforesaid dollar amount limitations to construct dwellings containing three or four bedrooms per family unit without sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability, he may increase such dollar amount limitations by not exceeding $1,080 for each additional bedroom (as defined by the Secretary) in excess of two contained in such family unit if he finds that such unit meets sound standards of livability as a three-bedroom or a four-bedroom unit as the case may be;




(3)
 have a maturity satisfactory to the Secretary but not to exceed thirty years from the date of the insurance of the mortgage;




(4)
 contain complete amortization provisions satisfactory to the Secretary;




(5)
 bear interest (exclusive of premium charges for insurance) at not to exceed 4½ per centum per annum on the amount of the principal obligation outstanding at any time;

(7)
 contain such terms and provisions with respect to insurance, repairs, alterations, payment of taxes, default reserves, delinquency charges, foreclosure proceedings, anticipation of maturity, additional and secondary liens, and other matters as the Secretary may in his discretion prescribe.

Such premium charges shall be payable by the mortgagee, either in cash or in debentures issued by the Secretary under this subchapter at par plus accrued interest, in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary: 
Provided
, That the Secretary may require the payment of one or more such premium charges at the time the mortgage is insured, at such discount rate as he may prescribe not in excess of the interest rate specified in the mortgage. If the Secretary finds upon the presentation of a mortgage for insurance and the tender of the initial premium charge or charges so required that the mortgage complies with the provisions of this subchapter, such mortgage may be accepted for insurance by endorsement or otherwise as the Secretary may prescribe; but no mortgage shall be accepted for insurance under this subchapter  unless  the  Secretary  finds  that  the project with respect to which the mortgage is executed is an acceptable risk in view of the needs of national defense. In the event that the principal obligation of any mortgage accepted for insurance under this subchapter is paid in full prior to the maturity date, the Secretary is further authorized in his discretion to require the payment by the mortgagee of an adjusted premium charge in such amount as the Secretary determines to be equitable, but not in excess of the aggregate amount of the premium charges that the mortgagee would otherwise have been required to pay if the mortgage has continued to be insured under this subchapter until such maturity date; and in the event that the principal obligation is paid in full as herein set forth the Secretary is authorized to refund to the mortgagee for the account of the mortgagor all, or such portion as he shall determine to be equitable, of the current unearned premium charges theretofore paid. Upon application of the mortgagee with the consent of the mortgagor of a mortgage for which a commitment to insure has been issued pursuant to 
section 1709 of this title
 covering property on which the construction of the dwellings thereon was begun prior to the enactment of this subchapter and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality in accordance with 
section 1715c of this title
, the Secretary is authorized, notwithstanding such beginning of construction, to convert such commitment to a commitment under 
section 1750g of this title
; any charges or fees paid to the Secretary with respect to such insurance under 
section 1709 of this title
 shall be credited to charges or fees due the Secretary with respect to such insurance under 
section 1750g of this title
; and the determination of prevailing wages in the locality for purposes of 
section 1715c of this title
 may be made by the Secretary of Labor at any time prior to the insurance under 
section 1750g of this title
: 
Provided
, That such mortgage, or the mortgage covering the same property executed in substitution therefor, is otherwise eligible for insurance under 
section 1750g of this title
.




(d)
 Preference or priority in purchasing or renting properties
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter or any other Act, except provisions of law enacted hereafter expressly referring to this subsection (d), the Secretary is further authorized to prescribe such procedures as are necessary to secure to persons engaged or to be engaged in national defense activities preference or priority of opportunity to purchase or rent properties, or interests therein, covered by mortgages insured under this subchapter.




(e)
 Conclusiveness of insurance contract as to eligibility
Any contract of insurance heretofore or hereafter executed by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the mortgage for insurance, and the validity of any contract of insurance so executed shall be incontestable in the hands of an approved mortgagee from the date of the execution of such contract, except for fraud or misrepresentation on the part of such approved mortgagee.

 Conveyance and assignment by mortgagee after foreclosure; debentures and certificates of claim; cost of foreclosure
In any case in which the mortgagee under a mortgage insured under 
section 1750b of this title

, That with respect to mortgages which are foreclosed before there shall have been paid on account of the principal obligation of the mortgage a sum equal to 10 per centum of the appraised value of the property as of the date the mortgage was accepted for insurance, there may be included in the debentures issued by the Secretary, on account of the cost of foreclosure (or of acquiring the property by other means) actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary an amount—
(1)
 not in excess of 2 per centum of the unpaid principal of the mortgage as of the date of the institution of foreclosure proceedings and not in excess of $75; or




(2)
 not in excess of two-thirds of such cost, whichever is the greater: 
Provided further
, That with respect to any debentures issued on or after 
September 2, 1964
, the Secretary may, with the consent of the mortgagee (in lieu of issuing a certificate of claim as provided in subsection (e) of this section), include in debentures, in addition to amounts otherwise allowed for such costs, an amount not to exceed one-third of the total foreclosure, acquisition, and conveyance costs actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by the Secretary, but in no event may the total allowance for such costs exceed the amount actually paid by the mortgagee: 
And provided further
, That with respect to mortgages to which the provisions of sections 532 and 536 of the Appendix to title 50,
1

 See References in Text note below.
 apply and which are insured under 
section 1750b of this title
, and subject to such regulations and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, there shall be included in the debentures an amount which the Secretary finds to be sufficient to compensate the mortgagee for any loss which it may have sustained on account of interest on debentures and the payment of insurance premiums by reason of its having postponed the institution of foreclosure proceedings or the acquisition of the property by other means during any part or all of the period of such military service and three months thereafter.




(b)

section 1750g of this title
 and the aggregate face value of the debentures issued, not to exceed $350, shall be adjusted by the payment of cash by the Secretary to the mortgagee from the General Insurance Fund.




(d)
 Debentures; execution; negotiability; terms; tax exemptions
The debentures issued under this section to any mortgagee shall be executed in the name of the General Insurance Fund as obligor, shall be signed by the Secretary by either his written or engraved signature, and shall be negotiable.

September 2, 1964
 shall be dated as of the date of default or as of such later date as the Secretary, in his discretion, may establish by regulation. The debentures shall bear interest from such date at a rate determined by the Secretary, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, at the time the mortgage was accepted for insurance, but not to exceed 3 per centum per annum, payable semiannually on the 1st day of January and the 1st day of July of each year. Such debentures shall mature twenty years after the date thereof. Such debentures shall be exempt, both as to principal and interest, from all taxation (except surtaxes, estate, inheritance, or gift taxes) now or hereafter imposed by any Territory, dependency, or possession of the United States, or by the District of Columbia, or by any State, county, municipality, or local taxing authority, and shall be paid out of the General Insurance Fund, which shall be primarily liable therefor, and they shall be fully and unconditionally guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, and such guaranty shall be expressed on the face of the debentures.

Provided
, That 
section 6101 of title 41
 shall not be construed to apply to any purchase or contract for services or supplies on account of such property if the amount thereof does not exceed $1,000. The power to convey and to execute in the name of the Secretary deeds of conveyances, deeds of release, assignments, and satisfactions of mortgages, and any other written instrument relating to real property or any interest therein heretofore or hereafter acquired by the Secretary pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be exercised by an officer appointed by him, without the execution of any express delegation of power or power of attorney: 
Provided
