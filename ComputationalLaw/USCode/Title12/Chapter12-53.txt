 Payment, clearing, and settlement activities conducted by financial institutions also present important risks to the participating financial institutions and to the financial system.




(4)
 Enhancements to the regulation and supervision of systemically important financial market utilities and the conduct of systemically important payment, clearing, and settlement activities by financial institutions are necessary—
