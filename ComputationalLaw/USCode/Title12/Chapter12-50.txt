Chapter 50
CHECK TRUNCATION
 Findings; purposes
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds as follows:
(1)
 In the Expedited Funds Availability Act [
12 U.S.C. 4001
 et seq.], enacted on 
August 10, 1987
, the Congress directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to consider establishing regulations requiring Federal reserve banks and depository institutions to provide for check truncation, in order to improve the check processing system.




(2)
 In that same Act, the Congress—
(A)
 provided the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with full authority to regulate all aspects of the payment system, including the receipt, payment, collection, and clearing of checks, and related functions of the payment system pertaining to checks; and




(B)
 directed that the exercise of such authority by the Board superseded any State law, including the Uniform Commercial Code, as in effect in any State.






(3)
 Check truncation is no less desirable in 2003 for both financial service customers and the financial services industry, to reduce costs, improve efficiency in check collections, and expedite funds availability for customers than it was over 15 years ago when Congress first directed the Board to consider establishing such a process.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are as follows:
(1)
 To facilitate check truncation by authorizing substitute checks.




(2)
 To foster innovation in the check collection system without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form.




(3)
 To improve the overall efficiency of the Nation’s payments system.




 Definitions
 General provisions governing substitute checks
(a)
 No agreement required
A person may deposit, present, or send for collection or return a substitute check without an agreement with the recipient, so long as a bank has made the warranties in 
section 5004 of this title
 with respect to such substitute check.




(b)
 Legal equivalence
A substitute check shall be the legal equivalent of the original check for all purposes, including any provision of any Federal or State law, and for all persons if the substitute check—
(1)
 accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check as of the time the original check was truncated; and




(2)
 bears the legend: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.”




(c)
 Endorsements
A bank shall ensure that the substitute check for which the bank is the reconverting bank bears all endorsements applied by parties that previously handled the check (whether in electronic form or in the form of the original paper check or a substitute check) for forward collection or return.




(d)
 Identification of reconverting bank
A bank shall identify itself as a reconverting bank on any substitute check for which the bank is a reconverting bank so as to preserve any previous reconverting bank identifications in conformance with generally applicable industry standards.




(e)
 Applicable law
A substitute check that is the legal equivalent of the original check under subsection (b) shall be subject to any provision, including any provision relating to the protection of customers, of part 229 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Uniform Commercial Code, and any other applicable Federal or State law as if such substitute check were the original check, to the extent such provision of law is not inconsistent with this chapter.




 Substitute check warranties
 Indemnity
(a)
 Indemnity
A reconverting bank and each bank that subsequently transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check in any electronic or paper form, and receives consideration for such transfer, presentment, or return shall indemnify the transferee, any subsequent collecting or returning bank, the depositary bank, the drawee, the drawer, the payee, the depositor, and any endorser, up to the amount described in subsections (b) and (c), as applicable, to the extent of any loss incurred by any recipient of a substitute check if that loss occurred due to the receipt of a substitute check instead of the original check.




(b)
 Indemnity amount
(1)
 Amount in event of breach of warranty
The amount of the indemnity under subsection (a) shall be the amount of any loss (including costs and reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of representation) proximately caused by a breach of a warranty provided under 
section 5004 of this title
.






(2)
 Amount in absence of breach of warranty
In the absence of a breach of a warranty provided under 
section 5004 of this title
, the amount of the indemnity under subsection (a) shall be the sum of—
(A)
 the amount of any loss, up to the amount of the substitute check; and




(B)
 interest and expenses (including costs and reasonable attorney’s fees and other expenses of representation).






(c)
 Comparative negligence
(1)
 In general
If a loss described in subsection (a) results in whole or in part from the negligence or failure to act in good faith on the part of an indemnified party, then that party’s indemnification under this section shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence or bad faith attributable to that party.






(2)
 Rule of construction
Nothing in this subsection reduces the rights of a consumer or any other person under the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable provision of Federal or State law.






(d)
 Effect of producing original check or copy
(1)
 In general
If the indemnifying bank produces the original check or a copy of the original check (including an image or a substitute check) that accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original check (as of the time the original check was truncated) or is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not a claim is valid, the indemnifying bank shall—
(A)
 be liable under this section only for losses covered by the indemnity that are incurred up to the time that the original check or copy is provided to the indemnified party; and




(B)
 have a right to the return of any funds it has paid under the indemnity in excess of those losses.






(2)
 Coordination of indemnity with implied warranty
The production of the original check, a substitute check, or a copy under paragraph (1) by an indemnifying bank shall not absolve the bank from any liability on a warranty established under this chapter or any other provision of law.






(e)
 Subrogation of rights
(1)
 In general
Each indemnifying bank shall be subrogated to the rights of any indemnified party to the extent of the indemnity.






(2)
 Recovery under warranty
A bank that indemnifies a party under this section may attempt to recover from another party based on a warranty or other claim.






(3)
 Duty of indemnified party
Each indemnified party shall have a duty to comply with all reasonable requests for assistance from an indemnifying bank in connection with any claim the indemnifying bank brings against a warrantor or other party related to a check that forms the basis for the indemnification.

 sufficient information to identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.






(2)
 Claim in writing
(A)
 In general
The bank holding the consumer account that is the subject of a claim by the consumer under subsection (a) may, in the discretion of the bank, require the consumer to submit the information required under paragraph (1) in writing.

(c)
 Recredit to consumer
(1)

 demonstrated to the consumer that the substitute check was properly charged to the consumer account.








(2)
 Timing of recredit
(A)
 In general
The bank shall recredit the consumer’s account for the amount described in paragraph (1) no later than the end of the business day following the business day on which the bank determines the consumer’s claim is valid.






(B)
 Recredit pending investigation
If the bank has not yet determined that the consumer’s claim is valid before the end of the 10th business day after the business day on which the consumer submitted the claim, the bank shall recredit the consumer’s account for—
(i)
 the lesser of the amount of the substitute check that was charged against the consumer account, or $2,500, together with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, no later than the end of such 10th business day; and

(2)
 Safeguard exceptions
A bank may delay availability to a consumer of a recredit provided under subsection (c)(2)(B)(i) until the start of either the business day following the business day on which the bank determines that the consumer’s claim is valid or the 45th calendar day following the business day on which the consumer submits a claim for such recredit in accordance with subsection (b), whichever is earlier, in any of the following circumstances:

(C)
 Prevention of fraud losses
The bank has reasonable cause to believe that the claim is fraudulent, based on facts (other than the fact that the check in question or the consumer is of a particular class) that would cause a well-grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person that the claim is fraudulent.








(3)
 Overdraft fees
No bank that, in accordance with paragraph (2), delays the availability of a recredit under subsection (c) to any consumer account may impose any overdraft fees with respect to drafts drawn by the consumer on such recredited amount before the end of the 5-day period beginning on the date notice of the delay in the availability of such amount is sent by the bank to the consumer.

, the Comptroller General of the United States shall evaluate the implementation and administration of this chapter, including—
(1)
 an estimate of the gains in economic efficiency made possible from check truncation;

 Depositary services efficiency and cost reduction
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds as follows:
(1)
 The Secretary of the Treasury has long compensated financial institutions for various critical depositary and financial agency services provided for or on behalf of the United States by—
(A)
 placing large balances, commonly referred to as “compensating balances”, on deposit at such institutions; and




(B)
 using imputed interest on such funds to offset charges for the various depositary and financial agency services provided to or on behalf of the Government.






(2)
 As a result of sharp declines in interest rates over the last few years to record low levels, or the public debt outstanding reaching the statutory debt limit, the Department of the Treasury often has had to dramatically increase or decrease the size of the compensating balances on deposit at these financial institutions.




(3)
 The fluctuation of the compensating balances, and the necessary pledging of collateral by financial institutions to secure the value of compensating balances placed with those institutions, have created unintended financial uncertainty for the Secretary of the Treasury and for the management by financial institutions of their cash and securities.




(4)
 It is imperative that the process for providing financial services to the Government be transparent, and provide the information necessary for the Congress to effectively exercise its appropriation and oversight responsibilities.




(5)
 The use of direct payment for services rendered would strengthen cash and debt management responsibilities of the Secretary of the Treasury because the Secretary would no longer need to dramatically increase or decrease the level of such balances when interest rates fluctuate sharply or when the public debt outstanding reaches the statutory debt limit.




(6)
 An alternative to the use of compensating balances, such as direct payments to financial institutions, would ensure that payments to financial institutions for the services they provide would be made in a more predictable manner and could result in cost savings.




(7)
 Limiting the use of compensating balances could result in a more direct and cost-efficient method of obtaining those services currently provided under compensating balance arrangements.




(8)
 A transition from the use of compensating balances to another compensation method must be carefully managed to prevent higher-than-necessary transitional costs and enable participating financial institutions to modify their planned investment of cash and securities.




(b)
 Authorization of appropriations for services rendered by depositaries and financial agencies of the United States
There are authorized to be appropriated for fiscal years beginning after fiscal year 2003 to the Secretary of the Treasury such sums as may be necessary for reimbursing financial institutions in their capacity as depositaries and financial agents of the United States for all services required or directed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or a designee of the Secretary, to be performed by such financial institutions on behalf of the Secretary of the Treasury or another Federal agency, including services rendered before fiscal year 2004.




(c)
 Orderly transition
(1)
 In general
As appropriations authorized in subsection (b) become available, the Secretary of the Treasury shall promptly begin the process of phasing in the use of the appropriations to pay financial institutions serving as depositaries and financial agents of the United States, and transitioning from the use of compensating balances to fund these services.






(2)
 Post-transition use limited to extraordinary circumstances
