(C)
 
Data sharing with other agencies and persons
.—
In addition to reports of examination, reports of condition, and other reports required to be regularly provided to the Corporation (with respect to all insured depository institutions, including a depository institution for which the Corporation has been appointed conservator or receiver) or an appropriate State bank supervisor (with respect to a State depository institution) under subparagraph (A) or (B), a Federal banking agency may, in the discretion of the agency, furnish any report of examination or other confidential supervisory information concerning any depository institution or other entity examined by such agency under authority of any Federal law, to—

The dates selected shall be the same for all insured depository institutions, except that when any of said reporting dates is a nonbusiness day for any depository institution, the preceding business day shall be its reporting date. Such reports of condition shall be the basis for the certified statements to be filed pursuant to subsection (c). The deposit liabilities shall be reported in said reports of conditions in accordance with and pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection, and such other information shall be reported therein as may be required by the respective agencies. Each said report of condition shall contain a declaration by the president, a vice president, the cashier or the treasurer, or by any other officer designated by the board of directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution to make such declaration, that the report is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. The correctness of said report of condition shall be attested by the signatures of at least two directors or trustees of the reporting depository institution other than the officer making such declaration, with a declaration that the report has been examined by them and to the best of their knowledge and belief is true and correct. At the time of making said reports of condition each insured depository institution shall furnish to the Corporation a copy thereof containing such signed declaration and attestations. Nothing herein shall preclude any of the foregoing agencies from requiring the banks or savings associations under its jurisdiction to make additional reports of condition at any time.




(4)
 In the reports of condition required to be made by paragraph (3) of this subsection, each insured depository institution shall report the total amount of the liability of the depository institution for deposits in the main office and in any branch located in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, any Territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Virgin Islands, according to the definition of the term “deposit” in and pursuant to subsection (
l
) of 
section 1813 of this title
 without any deduction for indebtedness of depositors or creditors or any deduction for cash items in the process of collection drawn on others than the reporting depository institution: 
Provided
, That the depository institution in reporting such deposits may (i) subtract from the deposit balance due to any depository institution the deposit balance due from the same depository institution (other than trust funds deposited by either depository institution) and any cash items in the process of collection due from or due to such depository institutions shall be included in determining such net balance, except that balances of time deposits of any depository institution and any balances standing to the credit of private depository institutions, of depository institutions in foreign countries, of foreign branches of other American depository institutions, and of American branches of foreign banks shall be reported gross without any such subtraction, and (ii) exclude any deposits received in any office of the depository institution for deposit in any other office of the depository institution: 
And provided further
, That outstanding drafts (including advices and authorizations to charge depository institution’s balance in another depository institution) drawn in the regular course of business by the reporting depository institution on depository institutions need not be reported as deposit liabilities. The amount of trust funds held in the depository institution’s own trust department, which the reporting depository institution keeps segregated and apart from its general assets and does not use in the conduct of its business, shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be separately stated in such reports. Deposits which are accumulated for the payment of personal loans and are assigned or pledged to assure payment of loans at maturity shall not be included in the total deposits in such reports, but shall be deducted from the loans for which such deposits are assigned or pledged to assure repayment.




(5)
 The deposits to be reported on such reports of condition shall be segregated between (i) time and savings deposits and (ii) demand deposits. For this purpose, the time and savings deposits shall consist of time certificates of deposit, time deposits-open account, and savings deposits; and demand deposits shall consist of all deposits other than time and savings deposits.

 The Board of Directors, after consultation with the Comptroller of the Currency and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, may by regulation define the terms “cash items” and “process of collection”, and shall classify deposits as “time”, “savings”, and “demand” deposits, for the purposes of this section.




(8)
 In respect of any report required or authorized to be supplied or published pursuant to this subsection or any other provision of law, the Board of Directors or the Comptroller of the Currency, as the case may be, may differentiate between domestic banks and foreign banks to such extent as, in their judgment, may be reasonably required to avoid hardship and can be done without substantial compromise of insurance risk or supervisory and regulatory effectiveness.




(9)
 
Data collections
.—
In addition to or in connection with any other report required under this subsection, the Corporation shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure that—
(A)
 each insured depository institution maintains; and




(B)
 the Corporation receives on a regular basis from such institution,





information on the total amount of all insured deposits, preferred deposits, and uninsured deposits at the institution. In prescribing reporting and other requirements for the collection of actual and accurate information pursuant to this paragraph, the Corporation shall minimize the regulatory burden imposed upon insured depository institutions that are well capitalized (as defined in section 1831
o
 of this title) while taking into account the benefit of the information to the Corporation, including the use of the information to enable the Corporation to more accurately determine the total amount of insured deposits in each insured depository institution for purposes of compliance with this chapter.

In the event of such consent, or if upon the record made at any such hearing, the agency shall find that any violation or unsafe or unsound practice specified in the notice of charges has been established, the agency may issue and serve upon the depository institution or the institution-affiliated party an order to cease and desist from any such violation or practice.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever the Board of Directors shall determine that an insured depository institution is not engaged in the business of receiving deposits, other than trust funds as herein defined, the Corporation shall notify the depository institution that its insured status will terminate at the expiration of the first full assessment period following such notice.

(q)
 Assumption of liabilities

(A)
 such officer or agency alleges a belief that such act or practice has been, is, or is likely to be a cause of or carried on in connection with or in furtherance of an act or practice within any one or more States which, in and of itself, would constitute an appropriate basis for action by a Federal officer or agency under this section; or




(B)
 the alleged act or practice is one which, if proven, would, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, adversely affect the insurance risk assumed by the Corporation.






(3)
 In any case in which any action or proceeding is brought pursuant to an allegation under paragraph (2) of this subsection for the suspension or removal of any officer, director, or other person associated with a foreign bank, and such person fails to appear promptly as a party to such action or proceeding and to comply with any effective order or judgment therein, any failure by the foreign bank to secure his removal from any office he holds in such bank and from any further participation in its affairs shall, in and of itself, constitute grounds for termination of the insurance of the deposits in any branch of the bank.

section 1811 of this title
] by or for a qualified institution while such amendments were in effect and while net worth certificates issued pursuant to these amendments are outstanding.”


“(a)
 
In General
.—
It is the sense of the Congress that the Federal banking agencies should facilitate early resolution of troubled insured depository institutions whenever feasible if early resolution would have the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund, consistent with the least-cost and prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act [
12 U.S.C. 1811
 et seq.].


“(b)
 
General Principles
.—
In encouraging the Federal banking agencies to pursue early resolution strategies, the Congress contemplates that any resolution transaction under section 13(c) of that Act [
12 U.S.C. 1823(c)
] would observe the following general principles:
“(1)
 
Competitive negotiation
.—
The transaction should be negotiated competitively, taking into account the value of expediting the process.




“(2)
 
Resulting institution adequately capitalized
.—
Any insured depository institution created or assisted in the transaction (hereafter the ‘resulting institution’) and any institution acquiring the troubled institution should meet all applicable minimum capital standards.




“(3)
 
Substantial private investment
.—
The transaction should involve substantial private investment.




“(4)
 
Concessions
.—
Preexisting owners and debtholders of any troubled institution or its holding company should make substantial concessions.




“(5)
 
Qualified management
.—
Directors and senior management of the resulting institution should be qualified to perform their duties, and should not include individuals substantially responsible for the troubled institution’s problems.




“(6)
 
FDIC’s participation
.—
The transaction should give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation an opportunity to participate in the success of the resulting institution.




“(7)
 
Structure of transaction
.—
The transaction should, insofar as practical, be structured so that—
“(A)
 the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—
“(i)
 does not acquire a significant proportion of the troubled institution’s problem assets;




“(ii)
 succeeds to the interests of the troubled institution’s preexisting owners and debtholders in proportion to the assistance the Corporation provides; and




“(iii)
 limits the Corporation’s assistance in term and amount; and






“(B)
 new investors share risk with the Corporation.






“(c)
 
Report
.—
Two years after the date of enactment of this Act [
Dec. 19, 1991
], the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shall submit a report to Congress analyzing the effect of early resolution on the deposit insurance funds.”
