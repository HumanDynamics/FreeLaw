Chapter 21
FINANCIAL RECORDKEEPING
 Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
(a)
 The Congress finds that certain records maintained by businesses engaged in the functions described in 
section 1953(b) of this title
 have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, and regulatory investigations and proceedings. The Congress further finds that the power to require reports of changes in the ownership, control, and managements of types of financial institutions referred to in 
section 1952 of this title
 may be necessary for the same purpose.


(b)
 It is the purpose of this chapter to require the maintenance of appropriate types of rec­ords and the making of appropriate reports by such businesses in the United States where such records or reports have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings.


“(a)
 Except as otherwise provided in this section, titles I, II, and III of this Act and the amendments made thereby [enacting this chapter and sections 1730d and 1829b of this title and section 1051 et seq. of former Title 31, Money and Finance, amending 
section 78g of Title 15
, Commerce and Trade, and enacting provisions set out as notes under 
section 78g of Title 15
 and section 1051 of former Title 31] take effect on the first day of the seventh calendar month which begins after the date of enactment [
Oct. 26, 1970
].


“(b)
 The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation provide that any provision of title I or II or any amendment made thereby [enacting this chapter and sections 1730d and 1829b of this title] shall be effective on any date not earlier than the publication of the regulation in the Federal Register and not later than the first day of the thirteenth calendar month which begins after the date of enactment [
Oct. 26, 1970
].”


 Reports on ownership and control
Where the Secretary determines that the making of appropriate reports by uninsured banks or uninsured institutions of any type with respect to their ownership, control, and managements and any changes therein has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, he may by regulation require such banks or institutions to make such reports as he determines in respect of such ownership, control, and managements and changes therein.
 Recordkeeping and procedures
(a)
 Regulations
If the Secretary determines that the maintenance of appropriate records and procedures by any uninsured bank or uninsured institution, or any person engaging in the business of carrying on in the United States any of the functions referred to in subsection (b) of this section, has a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, and that, given the threat posed to the security of the Nation on and after the terrorist attacks against the United States on 
September 11, 2001
, such records may also have a high degree of usefulness in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism, he may by regulation require such bank, institution, or person—
