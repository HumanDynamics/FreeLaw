Chapter 31
NATIONAL CONSUMER COOPERATIVE BANK
 Congressional statement of findings and purpose
The economic and financial structure of this country in combination with the Nation’s natural resources and the productivity of the American people has produced one of the highest average standards of living in the world. However, the Nation has been experiencing inflation and unemployment together with an increasing gap between producers’ prices and consumers’ purchasing power. This has resulted in a growing number of our citizens, especially the elderly, the poor, and the inner city resident, being unable to share in the fruits of our Nation’s highly efficient economic system. The Congress finds that user-owned cooperatives are a proven method for broadening ownership and control of the economic organizations, increasing the number of market participants, narrowing price spreads, raising the quality of goods and services available to their membership, and building bridges between producers and consumers, and their members and patrons. The Congress also finds that consumer and other types of self-help cooperatives have been hampered in their formation and growth by lack of access to adequate cooperative credit facilities and lack of technical assistance. Therefore, the Congress finds a need for the establishment of a National Consumer Cooperative Bank which will make available necessary financial and technical assistance to cooperative self-help endeavors as a means of strengthening the Nation’s economy.

The loan terms may provide for interest rates to vary from time to time during the repayment period of the loan in accordance with the rates being charged by the Bank for new loans at such times.

Subject to 
section 3012(13) of this title

The Bank in lieu of requiring such lender to service such guaranteed loan until final maturity or liquidation, may purchase the loan for the balance of the principal and accrued interest thereon without penalty, if it determines that (1) the liquidation of the loan would result in the insolvency of the borrower or deprive the borrower of assets essential to its continued operation, and (2) the loan will be repayable with revision of the loan rates, terms, or payment periods or other conditions not inconsistent with loans made by the Bank under subsection (a) of this section, which revisions the lender or other holder of such guaranteed loan is unwilling to make.




(e)
