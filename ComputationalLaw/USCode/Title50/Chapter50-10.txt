 Programs
(1)
 Membrane technology research
The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with other appropriate agencies, shall support a civilian research program to develop advanced membrane technology that is used in the separation of low-Btu gases, including technologies that remove helium and other constituent gases that lower the Btu content of natural gas.






(2)
 Helium separation technology
The Secretary of Energy shall support a research program to develop technologies for separating, gathering, and processing helium in low concentrations that occur naturally in geological reservoirs or formations, including—
(A)
 low-Btu gas production streams; and




(B)
 technologies that minimize the atmospheric venting of helium gas during natural gas production.






(3)
 Industrial helium program
The Secretary of Energy, working through the Advanced Manufacturing Office of the Department of Energy, shall carry out a research program—
(A)
 to develop low-cost technologies and technology systems for recycling, reprocessing, and reusing helium for all medical, scientific, industrial, commercial, aerospace, and other uses of helium in the United States, including Federal uses; and




(B)
 to develop industrial gathering technologies to capture helium from other chemical processing, including ammonia processing.






(c)
 Authorization of appropriations
There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $3,000,000.




 Helium-3 separation
(a)
 Interagency cooperation
The Secretary shall cooperate with the Secretary of Energy, or a designee, on any assessment or research relating to the extraction and refining of the isotope helium-3 from crude helium and other potential sources, including—
(1)
 gas analysis; and




(2)
 infrastructure studies.




(b)
 Feasibility study
The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, or a designee, may carry out a study to assess the feasibility of—
(1)
 establishing a facility to separate the isotope helium-3 from crude helium; and




(2)
 exploring other potential sources of the isotope helium-3.




(c)
 Report
Not later than 1 year after 
October 2, 2013
, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives a report that contains a description of the results of the assessments conducted under this section.




(d)
 Authorization of appropriations
There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $1,000,000.
