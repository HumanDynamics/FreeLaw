“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress finds the following:
“(1)
 On 
May 1, 2011
, United States personnel killed terrorist leader Osama bin Laden during the course of a targeted strike against his secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.




“(2)
 Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist organization, the most significant terrorism threat to the United States and the international community.




“(3)
 Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist attacks which killed nearly 3,000 civilians on 
September 11, 2001
, the most deadly terrorist attack against our Nation, in which al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and, due to heroic efforts by civilian passengers to disrupt the terrorists, near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.




“(4)
 Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other deadly terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies, including the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and against innocent civilians in countries around the world, including the 2004 attack on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain and the 2005 bombings of the mass transit system in London, England.




“(5)
 Following the 
September 11, 2001
, terrorist attacks, the United States, under President George W. Bush, led an international coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle al Qaeda, deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan and ungoverned areas along the Pakistani border, and bring Osama bin Laden to justice.




“(6)
 President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional forces and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan as ‘the central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism’.




“(7)
 The valiant members of the United States Armed Forces have courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and its affiliates in Afghanistan and around the world.




“(8)
 The anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence community have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the world with tremendous dedication, sacrifice, and professionalism.




“(9)
 The close collaboration between the Armed Forces and the intelligence community prompted the Director of National Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, ‘Never have I seen a more remarkable example of focused integration, seamless collaboration, and sheer professional magnificence as was demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the ultimate demise of Osama bin Laden.’.




“(10)
 While the death of Osama bin Laden represents a significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its affiliates and to terrorist organizations around the world, terrorism remains a critical threat to United States national security.




“(11)
 President Obama said, ‘For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda’s leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our Nation’s effort to defeat al Qaeda.’.




“(b)
 
Sense of Congress
.—
It is the sense of Congress that—
“(1)
 the raid that killed Osama bin Laden demonstrated the best of the intelligence community’s capabilities and teamwork;




“(2)
 for years to come, Americans will look back at this event as a defining point in the history of the United States;




“(3)
 it is vitally important that the United States memorialize all the events that led to the raid so that future generations will have an official record of the events that transpired before, during, and as a result of the operation; and




“(4)
 preserving this history now will allow the United States to have an accurate account of the events while those that participated in the events are still serving in the Government.




“(c)
 
Report on the Operation That Killed Osama Bin Laden
.—
Not later than 90 days after the completion of the report being prepared by the Center for the Study of Intelligence that documents the history of and lessons learned from the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit such report to the congressional intelligence committees.

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is intelligence that is produced from publicly available information and is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement.




“(2)
 With the Information Revolution, the amount, significance, and accessibility of open-source information has expanded significantly, but the intelligence community has not expanded its exploitation efforts and systems to produce open-source intelligence.




“(3)
 The production of open-source intelligence is a valuable intelligence discipline that must be integrated into intelligence tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, and dissemination to ensure that United States policymakers are fully and completely informed.




“(4)
 The dissemination and use of validated open-source intelligence inherently enables information sharing since open-source intelligence is produced without the use of sensitive sources and methods. Open-source intelligence products can be shared with the American public and foreign allies because of the unclassified nature of open-source intelligence.




“(5)
 The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (popularly referred to as the ‘9/11 Commission’), in its final report released on 
July 22, 2004
, identified shortfalls in the ability of the United States to use all-source intelligence, a large component of which is open-source intelligence.




“(6)
 In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (
Public Law 108–458
) [see Tables for classification], Congress calls for coordination of the collection, analysis, production, and dissemination of open-source intelligence.




“(7)
 The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, in its report to the President released on 
March 31, 2005
, found that ‘the need for exploiting open-source material is greater now than ever before,’ but that ‘the Intelligence Community’s open source programs have not expanded commensurate with either the increase in available information or with the growing importance of open source data to today’s problems’.




“(b)
 Department of Defense Strategy for Open-Source Intelligence.—
“(1)
 
Development of strategy
.—
The Secretary of Defense shall develop a strategy for the purpose of integrating open-source intelligence into the Defense intelligence process. The strategy shall be known as the ‘Defense Strategy for Open-Source Intelligence’. The strategy shall be incorporated within the larger Defense intelligence strategy.




“(2)
 
Submission
.—
The Secretary shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the strategy developed under paragraph (1). The report shall be submitted not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [
Jan. 6, 2006
].




“(c)
 
Matters to Be Included
.—
The strategy under subsection (b) shall include the following:
“(1)
 A plan for providing funds over the period of the future-years defense program for the development of a robust open-source intelligence capability for the Department of Defense, with particular emphasis on exploitation and dissemination.

 A description of proven tradecraft for effective exploitation of open-source intelligence, to include consideration of operational security.




“(5)
 A detailed description on how open-source intelligence will be fused with all other intelligence sources across the Department of Defense.




“(6)
 A description of—
“(A)
 a training plan for Department of Defense intelligence personnel with respect to open-source intelligence; and




“(B)
 open-source intelligence guidance for Department of Defense intelligence personnel.






“(7)
 A plan to incorporate the function of oversight of open-source intelligence—
“(A)
 into the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence; and




“(B)
 into service intelligence organizations.






“(8)
 A plan to incorporate and identify an open-source intelligence specialty into personnel systems of the Department of Defense, including military personnel systems.




“(9)
 A plan for the use of intelligence personnel of the reserve components to augment and support the open-source intelligence mission.




“(10)
 A plan for the use of the Open-Source Information System for the purpose of exploitation and dissemination of open-source intelligence.”
