“(a)
 The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the United States entered into Operation Restore Hope in December of 1992 for the purpose of relieving mass starvation in Somalia;




“(2)
 the original mission in Somalia, to secure the environment for humanitarian relief, had the unanimous support of the Senate, expressed in Senate Joint Resolution 45, passed on 
February 4, 1993
, and was endorsed by the House when it amended S.J. Res. 45 on 
May 25, 1993
;




“(3)
 Operation Restore Hope was being successfully accomplished by United States forces, working with forces of other nations, when it was replaced by the UNOSOM II mission, assumed by the United Nations on 
May 4, 1993
, pursuant to United Nations Resolution 814 of 
March 26, 1993
;




“(4)
 neither the expanded United Nations mission of national reconciliation, nor the broad mission of disarming the clans, nor any other mission not essential to the performance of the humanitarian mission has been endorsed or approved by the Senate;




“(5)
 the expanded mission of the United Nations was, subsequent to an attack upon United Nations forces, diverted into a mission aimed primarily at capturing certain persons, pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 837, of 
June 6, 1993
;




“(6)
 the actions of hostile elements in Mogadishu, and the United Nations mission to subdue those elements, have resulted in open conflict in the city of Mogadishu and the deaths of 29 Americans, at least 159 wounded, and the capture of American personnel; and




“(7)
 during fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the United States incurred expenses in excess of $1,100,000,000 to support operations in Somalia.




“(b)
 The Congress approves the use of United States Armed Forces in Somalia for the following purposes:
“(1)
 The protection of United States personnel and bases; and




“(2)
 The provision of assistance in securing open lines of communication for the free flow of supplies and relief operations through the provision of—
“(A)
 United States military logistical support services to United Nations forces; and




“(B)
 United States combat forces in a security role and as an interim force protection supplement to United Nations units: 
Provided
, That funds appropriated, or otherwise made available, in this or any other Act to the Department of Defense may be obligated for expenses incurred only through 
March 31, 1994
, for the operations of United States Armed Forces in Somalia: 
Provided further
, That such date may be extended if so requested by the President and authorized by the Congress: 
Provided further
, That funds may be obligated beyond 
March 31, 1994
 to support a limited number of United States military personnel sufficient only to protect American diplomatic facilities and American citizens, and noncombat personnel to advise the United Nations commander in Somalia: 
Provided further
, That United States combat forces in Somalia shall be under the command and control of United States commanders under the ultimate direction of the President of the United States:

 captured United States personnel in Somalia should be treated humanely and fairly; and

 the United States and the United Nations should make all appropriate efforts to ensure the immediate and safe return of any future captured United States personnel: 
Provided further
, That the President should ensure that, at all times, United States military personnel in Somalia have the capacity to defend themselves, and American citizens: 
Provided further
, That the United States Armed Forces should remain deployed in or around Somalia until such time as all American service personnel missing in action in Somalia are accounted for, and all American service personnel held prisoner in Somalia are released: 
Provided further
, That nothing herein shall be deemed to restrict in any way the authority of the President under the Constitution to protect the lives of Americans.”

“(2)
 The President of El Salvador has stated that there is no need for United States Armed Forces to conduct combat operations in El Salvador and that he has no intention of asking that they do so.

“(b)
 It is the sense of Congress that—
“(1)
 United States Armed Forces should not be introduced into or over the countries of Central America for combat; and




“(2)
 if circumstances change from those present on the date of the enactment of this Act and the President believes that those changed circumstances require the introduction of United States Armed Forces into or over a country of Central America for combat, the President should consult with Congress before any decision to so introduce United States Armed Forces and any such introduction of United States Armed Forces must comply with the War Powers Resolution [this chapter].”

“(2)
 if circumstances change from those present on the date of the enactment of this Act [
Oct. 12, 1984
] and the President believes that those changed circumstances require the introduction of United States Armed Forces into or over a country of Central America for combat, the President should consult with Congress before any decision to so introduce United States Armed Forces and any such introduction of United States Armed Forces must comply with the War Powers Resolution [this chapter].”




 (a)
 The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the removal of all foreign forces from Lebanon is an essential United States foreign policy objective in the Middle East;




“(2)
 in order to restore full control by the Government of Lebanon over its own territory, the United States is currently participating in the multinational peacekeeping force (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the ‘Multinational Force in Lebanon’) which was established in accordance with the exchange of letters between the Governments of the United States and Lebanon dated 
September 25, 1982
;

 the Multinational Force in Lebanon better enables the Government of Lebanon to establish its unity, independence, and territorial integrity;




“(4)
 progress toward national political reconciliation in Lebanon is necessary; and

] became operative on

], the purpose of this joint resolution is to authorize the continued participation of United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.


“(c)
 The Congress intends this joint resolution to constitute the necessary specific statutory authorization under the War Powers Resolution for continued participation by United States Armed Forces in the Multinational Force in Lebanon.


 (a)
 The Congress declares that the participation of the armed forces of other countries in the Multinational Force in Lebanon is essential to maintain the international character of the peacekeeping function in Lebanon.


“(b)
 The Congress believes that it should continue to be the policy of the United States to promote continuing discussions with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon with the objective of bringing about the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon and establishing an environment which will permit the Lebanese Armed Forces to carry out their responsibilities in the Beirut area.


“(c)
 It is the sense of the Congress that, not later than one year after the date of enactment of this joint resolution [
Oct. 12, 1983
] and at least once a year thereafter, the United States should discuss with the other members of the Security Council of the United Nations the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force to assume the responsibilities of the Multinational Force in Lebanon. An analysis of the implications of the response to such discussions for the continuation of the Multinational Force in Lebanon shall be included in the reports required under paragraph (3) of section 4 of this resolution.

50 U.S.C. 1541
 et seq.] or the requirement of section 4(a) of the Lebanon Emergency Assistance Act of 1983, relating to congressional authorization for any substantial expansion in the number or role of United States Armed Forces in Lebanon.
