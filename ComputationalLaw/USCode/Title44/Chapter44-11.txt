EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIARY PRINTING AND BINDING
 Printing and binding for the President
The Public Printer shall execute such printing and binding for the President as he may order and make requisition for.
 Printing to be authorized by law and necessary to the public business, not in excess of appropriation, and on special requisition filed with the Public Printer
(a)
 A head of an executive department, or of an independent agency or establishment of the Government may not cause to be printed, and the Public Printer may not print, a document or matter unless it is authorized by law and necessary to the public business.


(b)
 Printing may not be done for an executive department, independent agency or establishment in a fiscal year in excess of the amount of the appropriation.


(c)
 Printing may not be done without a special requisition signed by the chief of the department, independent agency or establishment and filed with the Public Printer.


 Certificate of necessity; estimate of cost
When a department, the Supreme Court, or the Library of Congress requires printing or binding to be done, it shall certify that it is necessary for the public service. The Public Printer shall then furnish an estimate of cost by principal items, after which requisitions may be made upon him for the printing or binding by the head of the department, the Clerk of the Supreme Court, or the Librarian of Congress, respectively. The Public Printer shall place the cost to the debit of the department in its annual appropriation for printing and binding.
 Restrictions on use of illustrations
Appropriations made for printing and binding may not be used for an illustration, engraving, or photograph in a document or report ordered printed by Congress unless the order to print expressly authorizes it, nor in a document or report of an executive department, independent office or establishment of the Government until the head of the executive department or Government establishment certifies in a letter transmitting the report that the illustration, engraving, or photograph is necessary and relates entirely to the transaction of public business.
 Form and style of work for departments
The Public Printer shall determine the form and style in which the printing or binding ordered by a department is executed, and the material and the size of type used, having proper regard to economy, workmanship, and the purposes for which the work is needed.
 Inserting “compliments” forbidden
A report, document, or publication distributed by or from an executive department or independent agency or establishment of the Government may not contain a notice that it is sent with “the compliments” of an officer of the Government, or with a special notice that it is so sent, except that notice that it has been sent, with a request for an acknowledgment of its receipt, may be given.
 Appropriations chargeable for printing and binding of documents or reports
 Presidential approval required for printing of periodicals; number printed; sale to public
The head of an executive department, independent agency or establishment of the Government, with the approval of the President, may use from the appropriations available for printing and binding such sums as are necessary for the printing of journals, magazines, periodicals, and similar publications he certifies in writing to be necessary in the transaction of the public business required by law of the department, office, or establishment. There may be printed, in addition to those necessary for the public business, not to exceed two thousand copies for free distribution by the issuing department, office, or establishment. The Public Printer, subject to regulation by the Joint Committee on Printing, shall print additional copies required for sale to the public by the Superintendent of Documents; but the printing of these additional copies may not interfere with the prompt execution of printing for the Government.
 Printing documents in two or more editions; full number and allotment of full quota
The number of copies of a public document or report authorized to be printed for an executive department, independent agency, or establishment of the Government may be supplied in two or more editions, instead of one, upon a requisition on the Public Printer by the head of the department or independent office, but the aggregate of the editions may not exceed the number of copies otherwise authorized. This section does not preclude the printing of the full number of a document or report, or the allotment of the full quota to Senators and Representatives, as otherwise authorized, when a legitimate demand for the full complement is known to exist.
 Daily examination of Congressional Record for immediate ordering of documents for official use; limit; bills and resolutions
The heads of executive departments, independent agencies and establishments, respectively, shall cause daily examination of the Congressional Record for the purpose of noting documents, reports, and other publications of interest to their departments, and shall cause an immediate order to be sent to the Public Printer for the number of copies of the publications required for official use, not to exceed, however, the number of bureaus in the department and divisions in the office of the head. The Public Printer shall send to each executive department, independent agency and establishment, as soon as printed, five copies of public bills and resolutions, except to the State Department, to which he shall send ten copies of bills and resolutions. When the head of a department, independent agency or establishment desires a greater number of a class of bills or resolutions for official use, the Public Printer shall furnish them on requisition promptly made.
 Annual reports: time for furnishing manuscript and proofs to Public Printer
The appropriations made for printing and binding may not be used for an annual report or the accompanying documents unless the manuscript and proof is furnished to the Public Printer in the following manner:
 Annual reports: type for reports of executive officers
The annual reports of executive officers shall be printed in the same type and form as the report of the head of the department which it accompanies, unless otherwise ordered by the Joint Committee on Printing.
 Annual reports: exclusion of irrelevant matter
Executive officers, before transmitting their annual reports, shall carefully examine them and all accompanying documents, and exclude all matter, including engravings, maps, drawings, and illustrations, except such as they certify in their letters transmitting the reports are necessary and relate entirely to the transaction of the public business.
 Annual reports: number of copies for Congress
One thousand copies of the annual reports of the departments to Congress shall be printed for the Senate, and two thousand for the House of Representatives.
 Annual reports: time of delivery by Public Printer to Congress
The annual reports of the Executive Departments and the accompanying documents shall be delivered by the Public Printer to the proper officer of each House of Congress at its first meeting. Other reports of the Executive Departments shall be so delivered on or before the third Wednesday next after the meeting of Congress or as soon after as may be practicable.
 Annual reports: limitation on number of copies printed; reports of bureau chiefs
Not to exceed five thousand copies, bound in pamphlet form, of the annual reports without appendices of a head of a department may be printed in a fiscal year. Not to exceed two thousand five hundred copies, bound in pamphlet form, of the reports without appendices of a chief of bureau may be printed in a fiscal year.
 Annual reports: discontinuance of printing of annual or special reports to keep within appropriations
In order to keep expenditures for printing and binding within appropriations, heads of executive departments, independent offices and establishments of the Government may discontinue the printing of annual or special reports under their respective jurisdictions. When the printing of reports is discontinued the original copy shall be kept on file in the office of the heads of the respective departments, independent offices or establishments for public inspection.
 Documents beyond scope of ordinary departmental business
A book or document not having to do with the ordinary business transactions of the executive departments may not be printed on the requisition of a department unless expressly authorized by Congress.
 Government publications as public property
Government publications of a permanent nature furnished by authority of law to officers other than Members of Congress of the United States Government, for their official use, shall be stamped “Property of the United States Government,” and shall be preserved by them and delivered to their successors in office as a part of the property of the office.
 Blanks and letterheads for judges and officers of courts
Blanks and letterheads for use by judges and other officials of the United States courts, other than those required to be paid for by any of these officers out of the emoluments of their offices, shall be printed at the Government Printing Office upon forms prescribed by the Department of Justice, and shall be distributed by it upon requisition.
 Paper and envelopes for Government agencies in the District of Columbia
The Public Printer may procure, under direction of the Joint Committee on Printing, as provided by sections 509–516 of this title, and furnish on requisition, paper and envelopes (not including envelopes printed in the course of manufacture) in common use by two or more departments, establishments, or services of the Government in the District of Columbia, and reimbursement shall be made to the Public Printer from appropriations or funds available for the purpose. Paper and envelopes so furnished by the Public Printer may not be procured in any other manner.
 Supplies for Government establishments
The Public Printer may procure and supply, on the requisition of the head of an executive department, independent office or establishment of the Government, complete manifold blanks, books, and forms required in duplicating processes, and complete patented devices with which to file money-order statements, or other uniform official papers, and charge them to the allotment for printing and binding of the department or Government establishment requiring them.
 Binding materials; bookbinding for libraries
Binding for the departments of the Government shall be done in plain sheep or cloth, except that record and account books may be bound in Russia leather, sheep fleshers, and skivers, when authorized by the head of a department. The libraries of the several departments, the Library of Congress, the libraries of the Surgeon General’s Office, and the Naval Observatory may have books for the exclusive use of these libraries bound in half Turkey, or material no more expensive.
