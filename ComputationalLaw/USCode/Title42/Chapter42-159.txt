 Human space flight beyond low-Earth orbit
(a)
 Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1)
 The extension of the human presence from low-Earth orbit to other regions of space beyond low-Earth orbit will enable missions to the surface of the Moon and missions to deep space destinations such as near-Earth asteroids and Mars.




(2)
 The regions of cis-lunar space are accessible to other national and commercial launch capabilities, and such access raises a host of national security concerns and economic implications that international human space endeavors can help to address.




(3)
 The ability to support human missions in regions beyond low-Earth orbit and on the surface of the Moon can also drive developments in emerging areas of space infrastructure and technology.




(4)
 Developments in space infrastructure and technology can stimulate and enable increased space applications, such as in-space servicing, propellant resupply and transfer, and in situ resource utilization, and open opportunities for additional users of space, whether national, commercial, or international.




(5)
 A long term objective for human exploration of space should be the eventual international exploration of Mars.




(6)
 Future international missions beyond low-Earth orbit should be designed to incorporate capability development and availability, affordability, and international contributions.
