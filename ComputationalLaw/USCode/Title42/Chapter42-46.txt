“(2)
 in fact, the National Crime Victim’s Survey, conducted annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice, does not specifically collect data relating to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;




“(3)
 studies in Canada, Australia, and Great Britain consistently show that victims with developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization because so few of the crimes against them are reported, and even when they are, there is sometimes a reluctance by police, prosecutors, and judges to rely on the testimony of a disabled individual, making individuals with developmental disabilities a target for criminal predators;




“(4)
 research in the United States needs to be done to—
“(A)
 understand the nature and extent of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;




“(B)
 describe the manner in which the justice system responds to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and




“(C)
 identify programs, policies, or laws that hold promises for making the justice system more responsive to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and

 the National Academy of Science Committee on Law and Justice of the National Research Council is a premier research institution with unique experience in developing seminal, multidisciplinary studies to establish a strong research base from which to make public policy.

The purposes of this Act are—
“(1)
 to increase public awareness of the plight of victims of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities;




“(2)
 to collect data to measure the extent of the problem of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and




“(3)
 to develop a basis to find new strategies to address the safety and justice needs of victims of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities.




“(a)
 
In General
.—
The Attorney General shall conduct a study to increase knowledge and information about crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities that will be useful in developing new strategies to reduce the incidence of crimes against those individuals.


“(b)

.—
The study conducted under this section shall address such issues as—

 the nature and extent of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;

 the manner in which the justice system responds to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and

 James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002
(a)
 Short title
This section may be cited as the “James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002”.




(b)
 Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
 nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;




(2)
 crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;




(3)
 there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to control this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their police power;




(4)
 recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers of body armor, a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects outfitted in body armor, and the 1997 murder of Captain Chris McCurley of the Etowah County, Alabama Drug Task Force by a drug dealer shielded by protective body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a violent crime;




(5)
 of the approximately 1,500 officers killed in the line of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;




(6)
 the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent of State and local police are not issued body armor;




(7)
 the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local police departments access to body armor that is no longer needed by Federal agencies; and




(8)
 Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.




(c)
 Definitions
In this section:
(1)

(2)
 Law enforcement agency
The term “law enforcement agency” means an agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of criminal law.

The term “law enforcement officer” means any officer, agent, or employee of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of criminal law.






(d)
 Amendment of sentencing guidelines with respect to body armor
(1)
 In general
Pursuant to its authority under 
section 994(p) of title 28
, the United States Sentencing Commission shall review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines and the policy statements of the Commission, as appropriate, to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any crime of violence (as defined in 
section 16 of title 18
) or drug trafficking crime (as defined in 
section 924(c) of title 18
) (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) in which the defendant used body armor.
