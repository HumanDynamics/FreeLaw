Chapter 81
ENERGY CONSERVATION AND RESOURCE RENEWAL
 Congressional findings and purpose
(a)
 The Congress finds that improvement in electric utility rate design has great potential for reducing the cost of electric utility services to consumers and current and projected shortages of capital, and for encouraging energy conservation and better use of existing electrical generating facilities.


(b)
 It is the purpose of this subchapter to require the Secretary to develop proposals for improvement of electric utility rate design and transmit such proposals to Congress; to fund electric utility rate demonstration projects; to intervene or participate, upon request, in the proceedings of utility regulatory commissions; and to provide financial assistance to State offices of consumer services to facilitate presentation of consumer interests before such commissions.


 Definitions
 Development of electric utility rate design proposals by Secretary; contents; submission to Congress; supporting analysis
(a)
 The Secretary shall develop proposals to improve electric utility rate design. Such proposals shall be designed to encourage energy conservation, minimize the need for new electrical generating capacity, and minimize costs of electric energy to consumers, and shall include (but not be limited to) proposals which provide for the development and implementation of—
(1)
 load management techniques which are cost effective;




(2)
 rates which reflect marginal cost of service, or time of use of service, or both;




(3)
 ratemaking policies which discourage inefficient use of fuel and encourage economical purchases of fuel; and




(4)
 rates (or other regulatory policies) which encourage electric utility system reliability and reliability of major items of electric utility equipment.




(b)
 The proposals prepared under subsection (a) of this section shall be transmitted to each House of Congress not later than 6 months after 
August 14, 1976
, for review and for such further action as the Congress may direct by law. Such proposals shall be accompanied by an analysis of—
(1)
 the projected savings (if any) in consumption of petroleum products, natural gas, electric energy, and other energy resources,




(2)
 the reduction (if any) in the need for new electrical generating capacity, and of the demand for capital by the electric utility industry, and




(3)
 changes (if any) in the cost of electric energy to consumers,





which are likely to result from the implementation nationally of each of the proposals transmitted under this subsection.

 Authorization of appropriations
 Congressional findings and purpose
(a)
 The Congress finds that—
(1)
 large amounts of fuel and energy are consumed unnecessarily each year in heating, cooling, ventilating, and providing domestic hot water for newly constructed residential and commercial buildings because such buildings lack adequate energy conservation features;




(2)
 Federal voluntary performance standards for newly constructed buildings can prevent such waste of energy, which the Nation can no longer afford in view of its current and anticipated energy shortage;




(3)
 the failure to provide adequate energy conservation measures in newly constructed buildings increases long-term operating costs that may affect adversely the repayment of, and security for, loans made, insured, or guaranteed by Federal agencies or made by federally insured or regulated instrumentalities; and




(4)
 State and local building codes or similar controls can provide an existing means by which to assure, in coordination with other building requirements and with a minimum of Federal interference in State and local transactions, that newly constructed buildings contain adequate energy conservation features.




(b)
 The purposes of this subchapter, therefore, are to—
(1)
 redirect Federal policies and practices to assure that reasonable energy conservation features will be incorporated into new commercial and residential buildings receiving Federal financial assistance;




(2)
 provide for the development and implementation, as soon as practicable, of voluntary performance standards for new residential and commercial buildings which are designed to achieve the maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency and increases in the use of nondepletable sources of energy; and




(3)
 encourage States and local governments to adopt and enforce such standards through their existing building codes and other construction control mechanisms, or to apply them through a special approval process.

 Repealed. 
 Congressional findings and purpose
(a)
 The Congress finds that—
(1)
 the fastest, most cost-effective, and most environmentally sound way to prevent future energy shortages in the United States, while reducing the Nation’s dependence on imported energy supplies, is to encourage and facilitate, through major programs, the implementation of energy conservation and renewable-resource energy measures with respect to dwelling units, nonresidential buildings, and industrial plants;




(2)
 current efforts to encourage and facilitate such measures are inadequate as a consequence of—
(A)
 a lack of adequate and available financing for such measures, particularly with respect to individual consumers and owners of small businesses;




(B)
 a shortage of reliable and impartial information and advisory services pertaining to practicable energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures and the cost savings that are likely if they are implemented in such units, buildings, and plants; and




(C)
 the absence of organized programs which, if they existed, would enable consumers, especially individuals and owners of small businesses, to undertake such measures easily and with confidence in their economic value;






(3)
 major programs of financial incentives and assistance for energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures in dwelling units, nonresidential buildings, and industrial plants would—
(A)
 significantly reduce the Nation’s demand for energy and the need for petroleum imports;




(B)
 cushion the adverse impact of the high price of energy supplies on consumers, particularly elderly and handicapped low-income persons who cannot afford to make the modifications necessary to reduce their residential energy use; and




(C)
 increase, directly and indirectly, job opportunities and national economic output;






(4)
 the primary responsibility for the implementation of such major programs should be lodged with the governments of the States; the diversity of conditions among the various States and regions of the Nation is sufficiently great that a wholly federally administered program would not be as effective as one which is tailored to meet local requirements and to respond to local opportunities; the State should be allowed flexibility within which to fashion such programs, subject to general Federal guidelines and monitoring sufficient to protect the financial investments of consumers and the financial interest of the United States and to insure that the measures undertaken in fact result in significant energy and cost savings which would probably not otherwise occur;




(5)
 to the extent that direct Federal administration is more economical and efficient, direct Federal financial incentives and assistance should be extended through existing and proven Federal programs rather than through new programs that would necessitate new and separate administrative bureaucracies; and




(6)
 such programs should be designed and administered to supplement, and not to supplant or in any other way conflict with, State energy conservation programs under part C of title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act [
42 U.S.C. 6321
 et seq.]; the emergency energy conservation program carried out by community action agencies pursuant to section 2809(a)(12)

 of this title; and other forms of assistance and encouragement for energy conservation.




(b)
 It is, therefore, the purpose of this subchapter to encourage and facilitate the implementation of energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures in dwelling units, nonresidential buildings, and industrial plants, through—
(1)
 supplemental State energy conservation plans; and




(2)
 Federal financial incentives and assistance.
