 Findings
 Purposes
 National prison rape statistics, data, and research
(a)
 Annual comprehensive statistical review
(1)
 In general
The Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice (in this section referred to as the “Bureau”) shall carry out, for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review and analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The statistical review and analysis shall include, but not be limited to the identification of the common characteristics of—
(A)
 both victims and perpetrators of prison rape; and




(B)
 prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape.






(2)
 Considerations
In carrying out paragraph (1), the Bureau shall consider—
(A)
 how rape should be defined for the purposes of the statistical review and analysis;




(B)
 how the Bureau should collect information about staff-on-inmate sexual assault;




(C)
 how the Bureau should collect information beyond inmate self-reports of prison rape;




(D)
 how the Bureau should adjust the data in order to account for differences among prisons as required by subsection (c)(3);




(E)
 the categorization of prisons as required by subsection (c)(4); and




(F)
 whether a preliminary study of prison rape should be conducted to inform the methodology of the comprehensive statistical review.






(3)
 Solicitation of views
The Bureau of Justice Statistics shall solicit views from representatives of the following: State departments of correction; county and municipal jails; juvenile correctional facilities; former inmates; victim advocates; researchers; and other experts in the area of sexual assault.






(4)
 Sampling techniques
The review and analysis under paragraph (1) shall be based on a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample, of not less than 10 percent of all Federal, State, and county prisons, and a representative sample of municipal prisons. The selection shall include at least one prison from each State. The selection of facilities for sampling shall be made at the latest practicable date prior to conducting the surveys and shall not be disclosed to any facility or prison system official prior to the time period studied in the survey. Selection of a facility for sampling during any year shall not preclude its selection for sampling in any subsequent year.






(5)
 Surveys
In carrying out the review and analysis under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall, in addition to such other methods as the Bureau considers appropriate, use surveys and other statistical studies of current and former inmates from a sample of Federal, State, county, and municipal prisons. The Bureau shall ensure the confidentiality of each survey participant, except as authorized in paragraph (7).






(6)
 Participation in survey
Federal, State, or local officials or facility administrators that receive a request from the Bureau under subsection (a)(4) or (5) will be required to participate in the national survey and provide access to any inmates under their legal custody.






(7)
 Reporting on child abuse and neglect
Nothing in section 3735 or 3789g of this title or any other provision of law, including paragraph (5), shall prevent the Bureau (including its agents), in carrying out the review and analysis under paragraph (1), from reporting to the designated public officials such information (and only such information) regarding child abuse or child neglect with respect to which the statutes or regulations of a State (or a political subdivision thereof) require prompt reporting.






(b)
 Review Panel on Prison Rape

The Panel shall hold a separate hearing regarding the three Federal or State prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape. The purpose of these hearings shall be to collect evidence to aid in the identification of common characteristics of both victims and perpetrators of prison rape, and the identification of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape, and the identification of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems that appear to have been successful in deterring prison rape.
