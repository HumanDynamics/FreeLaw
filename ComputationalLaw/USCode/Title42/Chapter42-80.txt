In addition the Secretary is authorized to make grants to any State or local government for the completion of plans, specifications, and estimates for local public works projects where either architectural design or preliminary engineering or related planning has already been undertaken and where additional architectural and engineering work or related planning is required to permit construction of the project under this chapter.

Any grant made for a public works project under this section shall be in such amount as may be necessary to make the Federal share of the cost of such project 100 per centum. No grant shall be made for a project under this section unless the Federal financial assistance for such project authorized under provisions of law other than this chapter is immediately available for such project and construction of such project has not yet been initiated because of lack of funding for the non-Federal share.

Any grant made for a public works project under this section shall be made in such amount as may be necessary to provide the requested State or local share of the cost of such project. A grant shall be made under this section for either the State or local share of the cost of the project, but not both shares.
