(i)
 Exemptions
(1)
 A rule issued under subsection (b), (g), or (
o
) of this section shall provide for the prompt exemption by the Secretary, through a simple and reasonable process, of any fleet from the requirements of subsection (b), (g), or (
o
) of this section, in whole or in part, if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that—
(A)
 alternative fueled vehicles that meet the normal requirements and practices of the principal business of the fleet owner are not reasonably available for acquisition;




(B)
 alternative fuels that meet the normal requirements and practices of the principal business of the fleet owner are not available in the area in which the vehicles are to be operated; or




(C)
 in the case of State and local government entities, the application of such requirements would pose an unreasonable financial hardship.






(2)
 In the case of private fleets, if the motor vehicles, when under normal operations, are garaged at personal residences at night, such motor vehicles shall be exempt from the requirements of subsections (b) and (g).




(j)
 Conversions
Nothing in this subchapter or the amendments made by this subchapter shall require a fleet owner to acquire conversion vehicles.




(k)
 Inclusion of law enforcement vehicles and urban buses

section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title
, as modified under 
section 13254 of this title
, and the Secretary finds that such inclusion would not hinder the use of the motor vehicles for law enforcement purposes, the Secretary may include such fleets in such program. The Secretary may only initiate one rulemaking under this paragraph.




(2)
 If the Secretary determines, by rule, that the inclusion of new urban buses, as defined by the Administrator under title II of the Clean Air Act [
42 U.S.C. 7521
 et seq.], in a fleet requirement program established under subsection (g) of this section would contribute to achieving the goal described in 
section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title
, as modified under 
section 13254 of this title
, the Secretary may include such urban buses in such program, if the Secretary finds that such application will be consistent with energy security goals and the needs and objectives of encouraging and facilitating the greater use of such urban buses by the public, taking into consideration the impact of such application on public transit entities. The Secretary may only initiate one rulemaking under this paragraph.




(3)
 Rulemakings under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be separate from a rulemaking under subsection (g) of this section, but may not occur unless a rulemaking is carried out under subsection (g) of this section.




(l)
 Consideration of factors
In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration energy security, costs, safety, lead time requirements, vehicle miles traveled annually, effect on greenhouse gases, technological feasibility, energy requirements, economic impacts, including impacts on workers and the impact on consumers (including users of the alternative fuel for purposes such as for residences, agriculture, process use, and non-fuel purposes) and fleets, the availability of alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles, and other relevant factors.




(m)
 Consultation and participation of other Federal agencies
In carrying out this section and 
section 13256 of this title
, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator, and other appropriate Federal agencies. The Secretary shall provide for the participation of the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator in the development and issuance of the rule under this section, including the public process concerning such rule.




(n)
 Petitions
As part of the rule promulgated either pursuant to subsection (b) or (g) of this section, the Secretary shall establish procedures for any fleet owner or operator or motor vehicle manufacturer to request that the Secretary modify or suspend a fleet requirement program established under either subsection nationally, by region, or in an applicable fleet area because, as demonstrated by the petitioner, the infrastructure or fuel supply or distribution system for an applicable alternative fuel is inadequate to meet the needs of a fleet. In the event that the Secretary determines that a modification or suspension of the fleet requirement program on a regional basis would detract from the nationwide character of any fleet requirement program established by rule or would sufficiently diminish the economies of scale for the production of alternative fueled vehicles or alternative fuels and thereafter the practicability and effectiveness of such program, the Secretary may only modify or suspend the program nationally. The procedures shall include provisions for notice and public hearings. The Secretary shall deny or grant the petition within 180 days after filing.




(o)
 Mandatory State fleet programs
(1)
 Pursuant to a rule promulgated by the Secretary, beginning in calendar year 1995 (when model year 1996 begins), the following percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired annually for State government fleets, including agencies thereof, but not municipal fleets, shall be alternative fueled vehicles:
(A)
 10 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1996;




(B)
 15 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1997;




(C)
 25 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1998;




(D)
 50 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1999;




(E)
 75 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 2000 and thereafter.






(2)
(A)
 The Secretary shall within 18 months after 
October 24, 1992
, promulgate a rule providing that a State may submit a plan within 12 months after such promulgation containing a light duty alternative fueled vehicle plan for State fleets to meet the annual percentages established under paragraph (1) for the acquisition of light duty motor vehicles. The plan shall provide for the voluntary conversion or acquisition or combination thereof, beyond any acquisition required by this subchapter, of such motor vehicles by State, local, or private fleets, in numbers greater than or equal to the number of State alternative fueled vehicles required pursuant to paragraph (1).




(B)
 The plan, if approved by the Secretary, would be in lieu of the State meeting such annual percentages solely through purchases of new State-owned vehicles. All conversions or acquisitions or combinations thereof of any alternative fueled vehicles under the plan must be voluntary and must conform with the requirements of section 247 of the Clean Air Act [
42 U.S.C. 7587
] and must comply with applicable safety requirements. The Secretary of Transportation shall within 3 years after enactment promulgate rules setting forth safety standards in accordance with chapter 301 of title 49 applicable to all conversions.
