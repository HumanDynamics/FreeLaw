Chapter 13A
CHILD NUTRITION
 Congressional declaration of purpose
In recognition of the demonstrated relationship between food and good nutrition and the capacity of children to develop and learn, based on the years of cumulative successful experience under the national school lunch program with its significant contributions in the field of applied nutrition research, it is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress that these efforts shall be extended, expanded, and strengthened under the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture as a measure to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children, and to encourage the domestic consumption of agricultural and other foods, by assisting States, through grants-in-aid and other means, to meet more effectively the nutritional needs of our children.

Russell National School Lunch Act [
42 U.S.C. 1751
 et seq.], and (B) nonprofit nursery schools, child-care centers, settlement houses, summer camps, and similar nonprofit institutions devoted to the care and training of children, which do not participate in a meal service program authorized under this chapter or the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.

 The limitation imposed under paragraph (1)(A) for participation of nonprofit schools in the special milk program shall not apply to split-session kindergarten programs conducted in schools in which children do not have access to the meal service program operating in schools the children attend as authorized under this chapter or the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act.

June 30, 1975
, and for subsequent school years, the minimum rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served in schools and other eligible institutions shall not be less than 5 cents per half-pint served to eligible children, and such minimum rate of reimbursement shall be adjusted on an annual basis each school year to reflect changes in the Producer Price Index for Fresh Processed Milk published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.

Disbursement to schools shall be made at such rates per meal or on such other basis as the Secretary shall prescribe. In selecting schools for participation, the State educational agency shall, to the extent practicable, give first consideration to those schools drawing attendance from areas in which poor economic conditions exist, to those schools in which a substantial proportion of the children enrolled must travel long distances daily, and to those schools in which there is a special need for improving the nutrition and dietary practices of children of working mothers and children from low-income families. Breakfast assistance disbursements to schools under this section may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary.

(1)
(A)
 Breakfasts served by schools participating in the school breakfast program under this section shall consist of a combination of foods and shall meet the minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary on the basis of tested nutritional research, except that the minimum nutritional requirements shall be measured by not less than the weekly average of the nutrient content of school breakfasts.

section 1758 of this title
.

(2)
 At the option of a local school food authority, a student in a school under the authority that participates in the school breakfast program under this chapter may be allowed to refuse not more than one item of a breakfast that the student does not intend to consume. A refusal of an offered food item shall not affect the full charge to the student for a breakfast meeting the requirements of this section or the amount of payments made under this chapter to a school for the breakfast.

(a)
 The Secretary shall withhold funds payable to a State under this chapter and disburse the funds directly to schools or institutions within the State for the purposes authorized by this chapter to the extent that the Secretary has so withheld and disbursed such funds continuously since

(E)
 The Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost-containment contracts to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and State agencies. The Secretary shall make the offer to State agencies once every 12 months.

“(a)
 Findings.—
“(1)
 the domestic infant formula industry is one of the most concentrated manufacturing industries in the United States;

 only three pharmaceutical firms are responsible for almost all domestic infant formula production;

 coordination of pricing and marketing strategies is a potential danger where only a very few companies compete regarding a given product;

 improved competition among suppliers of infant formula to the special supplemental food program [special supplemental nutrition program] for women, infants, and children (WIC) can save substantial additional sums to be used to put thousands of additional eligible women, infants, and children on the WIC program; and




“(5)
 barriers exist in the infant formula industry that inhibit the entry of new firms and thus limit competition.




“(b)
 
Purposes
.—
It is the purpose of this title [amending this section and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and
