 reasons for the proposed action,

 before an arbitrator mutually acceptable to the physician and the health care entity,




(ii)
 before a hearing officer who is appointed by the entity and who is not in direct economic competition with the physician involved, or

 before a panel of individuals who are appointed by the entity and are not in direct economic competition with the physician involved;

 in the case of a suspension or restriction of clinical privileges, for a period of not longer than 14 days, during which an investigation is being conducted to determine the need for a professional review action; or






(2)
 precluding an immediate suspension or restriction of clinical privileges, subject to subsequent notice and hearing or other adequate procedures, where the failure to take such an action may result in an imminent danger to the health of any individual.
