Chapter 93
EMERGENCY ENERGY CONSERVATION
 Congressional findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—
(1)
 serious disruptions have recently occurred in the gasoline and diesel fuel markets of the United States;




(2)
 it is likely that such disruptions will recur;




(3)
 interstate commerce is significantly affected by those market disruptions;




(4)
 an urgent need exists to provide for emergency conservation and other measures with respect to gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, and other energy sources in potentially short supply in order to cope with market disruptions and protect interstate commerce; and




(5)
 up-to-date and reliable information concerning the supply and demand of gasoline, diesel fuel, and other related data is not available to the President, the Congress, or the public.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are to—
(1)
 provide a means for the Federal Government, States, and units of local government to establish emergency conservation measures with respect to gasoline, diesel fuel, home heating oil, and other energy sources which may be in short supply;




(2)
 establish other emergency measures to alleviate disruptions in gasoline and diesel fuel markets;




(3)
 obtain data concerning such fuels; and




(4)
 protect interstate commerce.




 Definitions
 National and State emergency conservation targets
(a)
 Determination and publication of targets
(1)
 Whenever the President finds, with respect to any energy source for which the President determines a severe energy supply interruption exists or is imminent or that actions to restrain domestic energy demand are required in order to fulfill the obligations of the United States under the international energy program, the President, in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, may establish monthly emergency conservation targets for any such energy source for the Nation generally and for each State.




(2)
 Any finding of the President under paragraph (1) shall be promptly transmitted to the Congress, accompanied by such information and analysis as is necessary to provide the basis for such finding, and shall be disseminated to the public.




(3)
(A)
 The State conservation target for any energy source shall be equal to (i) the State base period consumption reduced by (ii) a uniform national percentage.




(B)
 For the purposes of this subsection, the term “State base period consumption” means, for any month, the product of the following factors, as determined by the President:
(i)
 the consumption of the energy source for which a target is established during the corresponding month in the 12-month period prior to the first month for which the target is established; and




(ii)
 a growth adjustment factor, which shall be determined on the basis of the trends in the use in that State of such energy source during the 36-month period prior to the first month for which the target is established.






(C)
(i)
 The President shall adjust, to the extent he determines necessary, any State base period consumption to insure that achievement of a target established for that State under this subsection will not impair the attainment of the objectives of section 753(b)(1)

 of title 15.




(ii)
 The President may, to the extent he determines appropriate, further adjust any State base period consumption to reflect—
(I)
 reduction in energy consumption already achieved by energy conservation programs;




(II)
 energy shortages which may affect energy consumption; and




(III)
 variations in weather from seasonal norms.








(D)
 For purposes of this subsection, the uniform national percentage shall be designed by the President to minimize the impact on the domestic economy of the projected shortage in the energy source for which a target is established by saving an amount of such energy source equivalent to the projected shortage, taking into consideration such other factors related to that shortage as the President considers appropriate.






(b)
 Notification and publication of targets
The President shall notify the Governor of each State of each target established under subsection (a) of this section for that State, and shall publish in the Federal Register, the targets, the base period consumption for each State and other data on which the targets are based, and the factors considered under subsection (a)(3) of this section.




(c)
 Establishment of targets for Federal agencies
In connection with the establishment of any national target under subsection (a) of this section the President shall make effective an emergency energy conservation plan for the Federal Government, which plan shall be designed to achieve an equal or greater reduction in use of the energy source for which a target is established than the national percentage referred to in subsection (a)(3)(D) of this section. Such plan shall contain measures which the President will implement, in accordance with other applicable provisions of law, to reduce on an emergency basis the use of energy by the Federal Government. In developing such plan the President shall consider the potential for emergency reductions in energy use—
(1)
 by buildings, facilities, and equipment owned, leased, or under contract by the Federal Government; and




(2)
 by Federal employees and officials through increased use of car and van pooling, preferential parking for multipassenger vehicles, and greater use of mass transit.




(d)
 Review of targets
(1)
 From time to time, the President shall review and, consistent with subsection (a) of this section, modify to the extent the President considers appropriate the national and State energy conservation targets established under this subsection.




(2)
 Any modification under this paragraph shall be accompanied by such information and analysis as is necessary to provide the basis therefor and shall be available to the Congress and the public.




(3)
(A)
 Before the end of the 12th month following the establishment of any conservation target under this section, and annually thereafter while such target is in effect, the President shall determine, for the energy source for which that target was established, whether a severe energy supply interruption exists or is imminent or that actions to restrain domestic energy demand are required in order to fulfill the obligations of the United States under the international energy program. The President shall transmit to the Congress and make public the information and other data on which any determination under this subparagraph is based.




(B)
 If the President determines such an energy supply interruption does not exist or is not imminent or such actions are not required, the conservation targets established under this section with respect to such energy source shall cease to be effective.






(e)
 Determination and publication of actual consumption nationally and State-by-State
Each month the Secretary shall determine and publish in the Federal Register (1) the level of consumption for the most recent month for which the President determines accurate data is available, nationally and for each State, of any energy source for which a target under subsection (a) of this section is in effect, and (2) whether the targets under subsection (a) of this section have been substantially met or are likely to be met.




(f)
 Presidential authority not to be delegated
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority vested in the President under this section may not be delegated.




 State emergency conservation plan
(a)
 State emergency conservation plans
(1)
(A)
 Not later than 45 days after the date of the publication of an energy conservation target for a State under 
section 8511(b) of this title
, the Governor of that State shall submit to the Secretary a State emergency conservation plan designed to meet or exceed the emergency conservation target in effect for that State under 
section 8511(a) of this title
. Such plan shall contain such information as the Secretary may reasonably require. At any time, the Governor may, with the approval of the Secretary, amend a plan established under this section.




(B)
 The Secretary may, for good cause shown, extend to a specific date the period for the submission of any State’s plan under subparagraph (A) if the Secretary publishes in the Federal Register notice of that extension together with the reasons therefor.






(2)
 Each State is encouraged to submit to the Secretary a State emergency conservation plan as soon as possible after 
November 5, 1979
, and in advance of such publication of any such target. The Secretary may tentatively approve such a plan in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the purposes of this subchapter such tentative approval shall not be construed to result in a delegation of Federal authority to administer or enforce any measure contained in a State plan.




(b)
 Conservation measures under State plans
(1)
 Each State emergency conservation plan under this section shall provide for emergency reduction in the public and private use of each energy source for which an emergency conservation target is in effect under 
section 8511 of this title
. Such State plan shall contain adequate assurances that measures contained therein will be effectively implemented in that State. Such plan may provide for reduced use of that energy source through voluntary programs or through the application of one or more of the following measures described in such plan:
(A)
 measures which are authorized under the laws of that State and which will be administered and enforced by officers and employees of the State (or political subdivisions of the State) pursuant to the laws of such State (or political subdivisions); and




(B)
 measures—
(i)
 which the Governor requests, and agrees to assume, the responsibility for administration and enforcement in accordance with subsection (d) of this section;




(ii)
 which the attorney general of that State has found that (I) absent a delegation of authority under Federal law, the Governor lacks the authority under the laws of the State to invoke, (II) under applicable State law, the Governor and other appropriate State officers and employees are not prevented from administering and enforcing under a delegation of authority pursuant to Federal law; and (III) if implemented, would not be contrary to State law; and




(iii)
 which either the Secretary determines are contained in the standby Federal conservation plan established under 
section 8513 of this title
 or are approved by the Secretary, in his discretion.








(2)
 In the preparation of such plan (and any amendment to the plan) the Governor shall, to the maximum extent practicable, provide for consultation with representatives of affected businesses and local governments and provide an opportunity for public comment.




(3)
 Any State plan submitted to the Secretary under this section may permit persons affected by any measure in such plan to use alternative means of conserving at least as much energy as would be conserved by such measure. Such plan shall provide an effective procedure, as determined by the Secretary, for the approval and enforcement of such alternative means by such State or by any political subdivision of such State.




(c)
 Approval of State plans
(1)
 As soon as practicable after the date of the receipt of any State plan, but in no event later than 30 days after such date, the Secretary shall review such plan and shall approve it unless the Secretary finds—
(A)
 that, taken as a whole, the plan is not likely to achieve the emergency conservation target established for that State under 
section 8511(a) of this title
 for each energy source involved,




(B)
 that, taken as a whole, the plan is likely to impose an unreasonably disproportionate share of the burden of restrictions of energy use on any specific class of industry, business, or commercial enterprise, or any individual segment thereof,




(C)
 that the requirements of this subchapter regarding the plan have not been met, or




(D)
 that a measure described in subsection (b)(1) of this section is—
(i)
 inconsistent with any otherwise applicable Federal law (including any rule or regulation under such law),




(ii)
 an undue burden on interstate commerce, or




(iii)
 a tax, tariff, or user fee not authorized by State law.








(2)
 Any measure contained in a State plan shall become effective in that State on the date the Secretary approves the plan under this subsection or such later date as may be prescribed in, or pursuant to, the plan.




(d)
 State administration and enforcement
(1)
 The authority to administer and enforce any measure described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section which is in a State plan approved under this section is hereby delegated to the Governor of the State and the other State and local officers and employees designated by the Governor. Such authority includes the authority to institute actions on behalf of the United States for the imposition and collection of civil penalties under subsection (e) of this section.




(2)
 All delegation of authority under paragraph (1) with respect to any State shall be considered revoked effective upon a determination by the President that such delegation should be revoked, but only to the extent of that determination.




(3)
 If at any time the conditions of subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii) of this section are no longer satisfied in any State with respect to any measure for which a delegation has been made under paragraph (1), the attorney general of that State shall transmit a written statement to that effect to the Governor of that State and to the President. Such delegation shall be considered revoked effective upon receipt by the President of such written statement and a determination by the President that such conditions are no longer satisfied, but only to the extent of that determination and consistent with such attorney general’s statement.




(4)
 Any revocation under paragraph (2) or (3) shall not affect any action or pending proceedings, administrative or civil, not finally determined on the date of such revocation, nor any administrative or civil action or proceeding, whether or not pending, based upon any act committed or liability incurred prior to such revocation.




(e)
 Civil penalty
(1)
 Whoever violates the requirements of any measure described in subsection (b)(1)(B) of this section which is in a State plan in effect under this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 for each violation.




(2)
 Any penalty under paragraph (1) may be assessed by the court in any action brought in any appropriate United States district court or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (3), any such penalty collected shall be deposited into the general fund of the United States Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.




(3)
 The Secretary may enter into an agreement with the Governor of any State under which amounts collected pursuant to this subsection may be collected and retained by the State to the extent necessary to cover costs incurred by that State in connection with the administration and enforcement of measures the authority for which is delegated under subsection (d) of this section.




 Standby Federal conservation plan

 of title 15, and shall provide for the emergency reduction in the public and private use of each energy source for which an emergency conservation target is in effect or may be in effect under 
section 8511 of this title
.




(b)
 Implementation of standby conservation plan
(1)
 If the President finds—
(A)
 after a reasonable period of operation, but not less than 90 days, that a State emergency conservation plan approved and implemented under 
section 8512 of this title
 is not substantially meeting a conservation target established under 
section 8511(a) of this title
 for such State and it is likely that such target will continue to be unmet; and




(B)
 a shortage exists or is likely to exist in such State for the 60-day period beginning after such finding that is equal to or greater than 8 percent of the projected normal demand, as determined by the President, for an energy source for which such conservation target has been established under 
section 8511(a) of this title
;





then the President shall, after consultation with the Governor of such State, make effective in such State all or any part of the standby Federal conservation plan established under subsection (a) of this section for such period or periods as the President determines appropriate to achieve the target in that State.




(2)
 If the President finds after a reasonable period of time, that the conservation target established under 
section 8511(a) of this title
 is not being substantially met and it is likely that such target will continue to be unmet in a State which—
(A)
 has no emergency conservation plan approved under 
section 8512 of this title
; or




(B)
 the President finds has substantially failed to carry out the assurances regarding implementation set forth in the plan approved under 
section 8512 of this title
,





then the President shall, after consultation with the Governor of such State, make effective in such State all or any part of the standby Federal conservation plan established under subsection (a) of this section for such period or periods as the President determines appropriate to achieve the target in that State.

The measures may include provisions whereby persons affected by such Federal measure are permitted to use alternative means of conserving at least as much energy as would be conserved by such Federal measure. Such measures shall provide effective procedures, as determined by the Secretary, for the approval and enforcement of such alternative means by such State or by any political subdivision thereof.




(2)
 The Secretary may approve the measures under paragraph (1) if he finds—
(A)
 that such measures when in effect will conserve at least as much energy as would be conserved by such Federal measure which would have otherwise been in effect in such State or political subdivision;




(B)
 such measures otherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph; and




(C)
 such measures would be approved under section 8512(c)(1)(B), (C), and (D) of this title.






(3)
 If the Secretary approves measures under this subsection such Federal measure shall cease to be effective in that State or political subdivision. Nothing in this paragraph shall affect any action or pending proceedings, administrative or civil, not finally determined on the date the Federal measure ceases to be effective in that State or political subdivision, nor any administrative or civil action or proceeding, whether or not pending, based upon any act committed or liability incurred prior to such cessation of effectiveness.




(4)
