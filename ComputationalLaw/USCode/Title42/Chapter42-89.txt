(a)
 Findings and purposes
(1)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—
(A)
 the effective provision of congregate services may require the redesign of units and buildings to meet the special physical needs of the frail elderly persons and the creation of congregate space to accommodate services that enhance independent living;




(B)
 congregate housing, coordinated with the delivery of supportive services, offers an innovative, proven, and cost-effective means of enabling frail older persons and persons with disabilities to maintain their dignity and independence;




(C)
 independent living with assistance is a preferable housing alternative to institutionalization for many frail older persons and persons with disabilities;




(D)
 365,000 persons in federally assisted housing experience some form of frailty, and the number is expected to increase as the general population ages;




(E)
 an estimated 20 to 30 percent of older adults living in federally assisted housing experience some form of frailty;

 a large and growing number of frail elderly residents face premature or unnecessary institutionalization because of the absence of or deficiencies in the availability, adequacy, coordination, or delivery of supportive services;

 the support service needs of frail residents of assisted housing are beyond the resources and experience that housing managers have for meeting such needs;

 supportive services would promote the invaluable option of independent living for nonelderly persons with disabilities in federally assisted housing;




(I)
 approximately 25 percent of congregate housing services program sites provide congregate services to young individuals with disabilities;

 to the extent that institutionalized older adults do not need the full costly support provided by such care, public moneys could be more effectively spent providing the necessary services in a noninstitutional setting; and

 the Congregate Housing Services Program, established by Congress in 1978, and similar programs providing in-home services have been effective in preventing unnecessary institutionalization and encouraging deinstitutionalization.
