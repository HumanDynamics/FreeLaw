“(3)
 The ‘lead Federal administering agency’ is the Federal agency, to be designated by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (from among the participating Federal agencies that have statutory responsibility for the Federal discretionary funds that will be used in a Performance Partnership Pilot), that will enter into and administer the particular Performance Partnership Agreement on behalf of that agency and the other participating Federal agencies.

 the non-Federal funds that are involved in the Pilot, by source (which may include private funds as well as governmental funds) and by amount;




“(E)
 the State, local, or tribal programs that are involved in the Pilot;

“(I)
 the outcome (or outcomes) that the Pilot is designed to achieve;

 the statutory, regulatory, or administrative requirements related to Federal mandatory programs that are barriers to achieving improved outcomes of the Pilot; and




“(L)

“(ii)
 the corrective actions that will be taken in order to increase the likelihood that the Pilot, upon completion, will have achieved such specified outcomes.








“(d)
 
Agency Head Determinations
.—
A Federal agency may participate in a Performance Partnership Pilot (including by providing Federal discretionary funds that have been appropriated to such agency) only upon the written determination by the head of such agency that the agency’s participation in such Pilot—
“(1)
 will not result in denying or restricting the eligibility of any individual for any of the services that (in whole or in part) are funded by the agency’s programs and Federal discretionary funds that are involved in the Pilot, and




“(2)
 based on the best available information, will not otherwise adversely affect vulnerable populations that are the recipients of such services.





In making this determination, the head of the agency may take into consideration the other Federal discretionary funds that will be used in the Pilot as well as any non-Federal funds (including from private sources as well as governmental sources) that will be used in the Pilot.


“(e)
 
Transfer Authority
.—
For the purpose of carrying out the Pilot in accordance with the Performance Partnership Agreement, and subject to the written approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of each participating Federal agency may transfer Federal discretionary funds that are being used in the Pilot to an account of the lead Federal administering agency that includes Federal discretionary funds that are being used in the Pilot. Subject to the waiver authority under subsection (f), such transferred funds shall remain available for the same purposes for which such funds were originally appropriated: 
Provided
, That such transferred funds shall remain available for obligation by the Federal Government until the expiration of the period of availability for those Federal discretionary funds (which are being used in the Pilot) that have the longest period of availability, except that any such transferred funds shall not remain available beyond 
September 30, 2018
.


“(f)
 
Waiver Authority
.—
In connection with a Federal agency’s participation in a Performance Partnership Pilot, and subject to the other provisions of this section (including subsection (e)), the head of the Federal agency to which the Federal discretionary funds were appropriated may waive (in whole or in part) the application, solely to such discretionary funds that are being used in the Pilot, of any statutory, regulatory, or administrative requirement that such agency head—
“(1)
 is otherwise authorized to waive (in accordance with the terms and conditions of such other authority), and




“(2)
 is not otherwise authorized to waive, provided that in such case the agency head shall—
“(A)
 not waive any requirement related to nondiscrimination, wage and labor standards, or allocation of funds to State and substate levels;




“(B)
 issue a written determination, prior to granting the waiver, with respect to such discretionary funds that the granting of such waiver for purposes of the Pilot—
“(i)
 is consistent with both—
     “(I)
 the statutory purposes of the Federal program for which such discretionary funds were appropriated, and




     “(II)
 the other provisions of this section, including the written determination by the agency head issued under subsection (d);






“(ii)
 is necessary to achieve the outcomes of the Pilot as specified in the Performance Partnership Agreement, and is no broader in scope than is necessary to achieve such outcomes; and




“(iii)
 will result in either—
     “(I)
 realizing efficiencies by simplifying reporting burdens or reducing administrative barriers with respect to such discretionary funds, or




     “(II)
 increasing the ability of individuals to obtain access to services that are provided by such discretionary funds; and








“(C)
 provide at least 60 days advance written notice to the Committees on Appropriations and other committees of jurisdiction in the House of Representatives and the Senate.”
