 Definition of Restricted Data
In this subchapter, the term “Restricted Data” has the meaning given that term in 
 Findings; sense of Congress
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1)
 Since World War II, Federal nuclear activities have been explicitly recognized under Federal law as activities that are ultra-hazardous. Nuclear weapons production and testing have involved unique dangers, including potential catastrophic nuclear accidents that private insurance carriers have not covered and recurring exposures to radioactive substances and beryllium that, even in small amounts, can cause medical harm.




(2)
 Since the inception of the nuclear weapons program and for several decades afterwards, a large number of nuclear weapons workers at sites of the Department of Energy and at sites of vendors who supplied the Cold War effort were put at risk without their knowledge and consent for reasons that, documents reveal, were driven by fears of adverse publicity, liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay.




(3)
 Many previously secret records have documented unmonitored exposures to radiation and beryllium and continuing problems at these sites across the Nation, at which the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies have been, since World War II, self-regulating with respect to nuclear safety and occupational safety and health. No other hazardous Federal activity has been permitted to be carried out under such sweeping powers of self-regulation.




(4)
 The policy of the Department of Energy has been to litigate occupational illness claims, which has deterred workers from filing workers’ compensation claims and has imposed major financial burdens for such employees who have sought compensation. Contractors of the Department have been held harmless and the employees have been denied workers’ compensation coverage for occupational disease.




(5)
 Over the past 20 years, more than two dozen scientific findings have emerged that indicate that certain of such employees are experiencing increased risks of dying from cancer and non-malignant diseases. Several of these studies have also established a correlation between excess diseases and exposure to radiation and beryllium.




(6)
 While linking exposure to occupational hazards with the development of occupational disease is sometimes difficult, scientific evidence supports the conclusion that occupational exposure to dust particles or vapor of beryllium can cause beryllium sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease. Furthermore, studies indicate than 98 percent of radiation-induced cancers within the nuclear weapons complex have occurred at dose levels below existing maximum safe thresholds.




(7)
 Existing information indicates that State workers’ compensation programs do not provide a uniform means of ensuring adequate compensation for the types of occupational illnesses and diseases that relate to the employees at those sites.




(8)
 To ensure fairness and equity, the civilian men and women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies should have efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for beryllium-related health conditions and radiation-related health conditions.




(9)
 On 
April 12, 2000
, the Secretary of Energy announced that the Administration intended to seek compensation for individuals with a broad range of work-related illnesses throughout the Department of Energy’s nuclear weapons complex.




(10)
 However, as of 
October 2, 2000
, the Administration has failed to provide Congress with the necessary legislative and budget proposals to enact the promised compensation program.




(b)
 Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that—
(1)
 a program should be established to provide compensation to covered employees;




(2)
 a fund for payment of such compensation should be established on the books of the Treasury;




(3)
 payments from that fund should be made only after—
(A)
 the identification of employees of the Department of Energy (including its predecessor agencies), and of contractors of the Department, who may be members of the group of covered employees;




(B)
 the establishment of a process to receive and administer claims for compensation for disability or death of covered employees;




(C)
 the submittal by the President of a legislative proposal for compensation of such employees that includes the estimated annual budget resources for that compensation; and




(D)
 consideration by the Congress of the legislative proposal submitted by the President; and






(4)
 payments from that fund should commence not later than fiscal year 2002.




“(a)
 
Update of Report
.—
Not later than 
December 31, 2006
, the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health shall submit to Congress an update to the report required by section 3151(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (
Public Law 107–107
; 
42 U.S.C. 7384
 note).


“(b)
 
Elements
.—
The update shall—
“(1)
 for each facility for which such report found that insufficient information was available to determine whether significant residual contamination was present, determine whether significant residual contamination was present;




“(2)
 for each facility for which such report found that significant residual contamination remained present as of the date of the report, determine the date on which such contamination ceased to be present;




“(3)
 for each facility for which such report found that significant residual contamination was present but for which the Director has been unable to determine the extent to which such contamination is attributable to atomic weapons-related activities, identify the specific dates of coverage attributable to such activities and, in so identifying, presume that such contamination is attributable to such activities until there is evidence of decontamination of residual contamination identified with atomic weapons-related activities;




“(4)
 for each facility for which such report found significant residual contamination, determine whether it is at least as likely as not that such contamination could have caused an employee who was employed at such facility only during the residual contamination period to contract a cancer or beryllium illness compensable under subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 [
42 U.S.C. 7384
l
 et seq.]; and




“(5)
 if new information that pertains to the report has been made available to the Director since that report was submitted, identify and describe such information.




“(c)
 
Publication
.—
The Director shall ensure that the report referred to in subsection (a) is published in the Federal Register not later than 15 days after being released.”
