Chapter 119
HOMELESS ASSISTANCE
 Findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—
(1)
 the Nation faces an immediate and unprecedented crisis due to the lack of shelter for a growing number of individuals and families, including elderly persons, handicapped persons, families with children, Native Americans, and veterans;




(2)
 the problem of homelessness has become more severe and, in the absence of more effective efforts, is expected to become dramatically worse, endangering the lives and safety of the homeless;




(3)
 the causes of homelessness are many and complex, and homeless individuals have diverse needs;




(4)
 there is no single, simple solution to the problem of homelessness because of the different subpopulations of the homeless, the different causes of and reasons for homelessness, and the different needs of homeless individuals;




(5)
 due to the record increase in homelessness, States, units of local government, and private voluntary organizations have been unable to meet the basic human needs of all the homeless and, in the absence of greater Federal assistance, will be unable to protect the lives and safety of all the homeless in need of assistance; and




(6)
 the Federal Government has a clear responsibility and an existing capacity to fulfill a more effective and responsible role to meet the basic human needs and to engender respect for the human dignity of the homeless.




(b)
 Purpose
It is the purpose of this chapter—
(1)
 to establish the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness;




(2)
 to use public resources and programs in a more coordinated manner to meet the critically urgent needs of the homeless of the Nation; and




(3)
 to provide funds for programs to assist the homeless, with special emphasis on elderly persons, handicapped persons, families with children, Native Americans, and veterans.
