Chapter 69
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
 Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
(a)
 Critical social, economic, and environmental problems facing Nation’s urban communities
The Congress finds and declares that the Nation’s cities, towns, and smaller urban communities face critical social, economic, and environmental problems arising in significant measure from—
(1)
 the growth of population in metropolitan and other urban areas, and the concentration of persons of lower income in central cities;




(2)
 inadequate public and private investment and reinvestment in housing and other physical facilities, and related public and social services, resulting in the growth and persistence of urban slums and blight and the marked deterioration of the quality of the urban environment; and




(3)
 increasing energy costs which have seriously undermined the quality and overall effectiveness of local community and housing development activities.




(b)
 Establishment and maintenance of viable urban communities; systematic and sustained action by Federal, State, and local governments; expansion of and continuity in Federal assistance; increased private investment; streamlining programs and improvement of functioning of agencies; action to address consequences of scarce fuel supplies
The Congress further finds and declares that the future welfare of the Nation and the well-being of its citizens depend on the establishment and maintenance of viable urban communities as social, economic, and political entities, and require—
(1)
 systematic and sustained action by Federal, State, and local governments to eliminate blight, to conserve and renew older urban areas, to improve the living environment of low- and moderate-income families, and to develop new centers of population growth and economic activity;




(2)
 substantial expansion of and greater continuity in the scope and level of Federal assistance, together with increased private investment in support of community development activities;




(3)
 continuing effort at all levels of government to streamline programs and improve the functioning of agencies responsible for planning, implementing, and evaluating community development efforts; and




(4)
 concerted action by Federal, State, and local governments to address the economic and social hardships borne by communities as a consequence of scarce fuel supplies.




(c)
 Decent housing, suitable living environment, and economic opportunities for persons of low and moderate income; community development activities which may be supported by Federal assistance
The primary objective of this chapter and of the community development program of each grantee under this chapter is the development of viable urban communities, by providing decent housing and a suitable living environment and expanding economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. Consistent with this primary objective, not less than 70 percent of the aggregate of the Federal assistance provided to States and units of general local government under 
section 5306 of this title
 and, if applicable, the funds received as a result of a guarantee or a grant under 
section 5308 of this title
, shall be used for the support of activities that benefit persons of low and moderate income, and the Federal assistance provided in this chapter is for the support of community development activities which are directed toward the following specific objectives—
(1)
 the elimination of slums and blight and the prevention of blighting influences and the deterioration of property and neighborhood and community facilities of importance to the welfare of the community, principally persons of low and moderate income;




(2)
 the elimination of conditions which are detrimental to health, safety, and public welfare, through code enforcement, demolition, interim rehabilitation assistance, and related activities;




(3)
 the conservation and expansion of the Nation’s housing stock in order to provide a decent home and a suitable living environment for all persons, but principally those of low and moderate income;




(4)
 the expansion and improvement of the quantity and quality of community services, principally for persons of low and moderate income, which are essential for sound community development and for the development of viable urban communities;




(5)
 a more rational utilization of land and other natural resources and the better arrangement of residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and other needed activity centers;




(6)
 the reduction of the isolation of income groups within communities and geographical areas and the promotion of an increase in the diversity and vitality of neighborhoods through the spatial deconcentration of housing opportunities for persons of lower income and the revitalization of deteriorating or deteriorated neighborhoods;




(7)
 the restoration and preservation of properties of special value for historic, architectural, or esthetic reasons;




(8)
 the alleviation of physical and economic distress through the stimulation of private investment and community revitalization in areas with population outmigration or a stagnating or declining tax base; and




(9)
 the conservation of the Nation’s scarce energy resources, improvement of energy efficiency, and the provision of alternative and renewable energy sources of supply.





It is the intent of Congress that the Federal assistance made available under this chapter not be utilized to reduce substantially the amount of local financial support for community development activities below the level of such support prior to the availability of such assistance.


(d)
 Consolidation of complex and overlapping Federal assistance programs into consistent system of Federal aid
It is also the purpose of this chapter to further the development of a national urban growth policy by consolidating a number of complex and overlapping programs of financial assistance to communities of varying sizes and needs into a consistent system of Federal aid which—
(1)
 provides assistance on an annual basis, with maximum certainty and minimum delay, upon which communities can rely in their planning;




(2)
 encourages community development activities which are consistent with comprehensive local and areawide development planning;




(3)
 furthers achievement of the national housing goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family; and




(4)
 fosters the undertaking of housing and community development activities in a coordinated and mutually supportive manner by Federal agencies and programs, as well as by communities.

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 for the past 50 years, the Federal Government has taken the leading role in enabling the people of the Nation to be the best housed in the world, and recent reductions in Federal assistance have contributed to a deepening housing crisis for low- and moderate-income families;




“(2)
 the efforts of the Federal Government have included a system of specialized lending institutions, favorable tax policies, construction assistance, mortgage insurance, loan guarantees, secondary markets, and interest and rental subsidies, that have enabled people to rent or buy affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and




“(3)
 the tragedy of homelessness in urban and suburban communities across the Nation, involving a record number of people, dramatically demonstrates the lack of affordable residential shelter, and people living on the economic margins of our society (lower income families, the elderly, the working poor, and the deinstitutionalized) have few available alternatives for shelter.




“(b)
 
Purpose
.—
The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note above], therefore, is—
“(1)
 to reaffirm the principle that decent and affordable shelter is a basic necessity, and the general welfare of the Nation and the health and living standards of its people require the addition of new housing units to remedy a serious shortage of housing units for all Americans, particularly for persons of low and moderate income;




“(2)
 to make the distribution of direct and indirect housing assistance more equitable by providing Federal assistance for the less affluent people of the Nation;




“(3)
 to provide needed housing assistance for homeless people and for persons of low and moderate income who lack affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and




“(4)
 to reform existing programs to ensure that such assistance is delivered in the most efficient manner possible.”




“(a)
 
In General
.—
This Act and the amendments made by this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note above] may not be construed to provide for new budget authority, budget outlays, or new entitlement authority, for fiscal year 1988 in excess of the appropriate aggregate levels established by the concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal year for the programs authorized by this Act and the amendments made by this Act.


“(b)
 
Definitions
.—
For purposes of this section, the terms ‘budget authority’, ‘budget outlays’, ‘concurrent resolution on the budget’, and ‘entitlement authority’ have the meanings given such terms in section 3 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (
2 U.S.C. 622
).”

(6)
(A)
 Where data are available, the amount determined under paragraph (1) for a metropolitan city that has been formed by the consolidation of one or more metropolitan cities with an urban county shall be equal to the sum of the amounts that would have been determined under paragraph (1) for the metropolitan city or cities and the balance of the consolidated government, if such consolidation had not occurred. This paragraph shall apply only to any consolidation that—
(i)
 included all metropolitan cities that received grants under this section for the fiscal year preceding such consolidation and that were located within the urban county;

section 5304 of this title
, or which become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title, shall be reallocated in the succeeding fiscal year to the other metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same metropolitan area which certify to the satisfaction of the Secretary that they would be adversely affected by the loss of such amounts from the metropolitan area. The amount of the share of funds reallocated under this paragraph for any metropolitan city or urban county shall bear the same ratio to the total of such reallocated funds in the metropolitan area as the amount of funds awarded to the city or county for the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds become available bears to the total amount of funds awarded to all metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same metropolitan area for that fiscal year, except that—
(A)
 in determining the amounts awarded to cities or counties for purposes of calculating shares pursuant to this sentence, there shall be excluded from the award of any city or county any amounts which become available as a result of actions against such city or county under 
section 5311 of this title
;




(B)

 in no event may the share of reallocated funds for any metropolitan city or urban county exceed 25 per centum of the amount awarded to the city or county under subsection (b) of this section for the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds under this paragraph become available.





Any amounts allocated under subsection (b) of this section which become available for reallocation and for which no metropolitan city or urban county qualifies under this paragraph shall be added to amounts available for allocation under such subsection (b) of this section in the succeeding fiscal year.




(2)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall make grants from amounts authorized for use under subsection (b) of this section by the Department of Housing and Urban Development—Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1981, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter which governed grants with respect to such amounts, as such provisions existed prior to

January 1, 1982
, shall be reallocated in accordance with paragraph (1).




(3)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Secretary may upon request transfer responsibility to any metropolitan city for the administration of any amounts received, but not obligated, by the urban county in which such city is located if (A) such city was an included unit of general local government in such county prior to the qualification of such city as a metropolitan city; (B) such amounts were designated and received by such county for use in such city prior to the qualification of such city as a metropolitan city; and (C) such city and county agree to such transfer of responsibility for the administration of such amounts.

 et seq.], the Secretary shall make available, to metropolitan cities and urban counties located or partially located in the areas affected by the disaster, any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title.




(B)
 In using any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title, the Secretary shall give priority to providing emergency assistance under this paragraph.




(C)
 The Secretary may provide assistance to any metropolitan city or urban county under this paragraph only to the extent necessary to meet emergency community development needs, as the Secretary shall determine (subject to subparagraph (D)), of the city or county resulting from the disaster that are not met with amounts otherwise provided under this chapter, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [
42 U.S.C. 5121
 et seq.], and other sources of assistance.




(D)
 Amounts provided to metropolitan cities and urban counties under this paragraph may be used only for eligible activities under 
section 5305 of this title

 A metropolitan city or urban county eligible for assistance under this paragraph may receive such assistance only in each of the fiscal years ending during the 3-year period beginning on the date of the declaration of the disaster by the President.




(G)
 This paragraph may not be construed to require the Secretary to reserve any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title for assistance under this paragraph if, when such amounts are to be reallocated under paragraph (1), no metropolitan city or urban county qualifies for assistance under this paragraph.






(d)

(1)
 Of the amount approved in an appropriation Act under 
section 5303 of this title
 that remains after allocations pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a) of this section, 30 per centum shall be allocated among the States for use in nonentitlement areas. The allocation for each State shall be the greater of an amount that bears the same ratio to the allocation for such areas of all States available under this subparagraph as either—
(A)
 the average of the ratios between—
(i)
 the population of the nonentitlement areas in that State and the population of the nonentitlement areas of all States;




(ii)
 the extent of poverty in the nonenti­tlement areas in that State and the extent of poverty in the nonentitlement areas of all States; and




(iii)

In determining the average of the ratios under subparagraph (A) the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted twice and each of the other ratios shall be counted once; and in determining the average of the ratios under subparagraph (B), the ratio involving the age of housing shall be counted two and one-half times, the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted one and one-half times, and the ratio involving population shall be counted once. The Secretary shall, in order to compensate for the discrepancy between the total of the amounts to be allocated under this paragraph and the total of the amounts available under such paragraph, make a pro rata reduction of each amount allocated to the nonenti­tlement areas in each State under such paragraph so that the nonentitlement areas in each State will receive an amount which represents the same percentage of the total amount available under such paragraph as the percentage which the nonentitlement areas of the same State would have received under such paragraph if the total amount available under such paragraph had equaled the total amount which was allocated under such paragraph.




(2)
(A)
 Amounts allocated under paragraph (1) shall be distributed to units of general local government located in nonentitlement areas of the State to carry out activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter—

Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall make grants from amounts authorized for use in nonentitlement areas by the Department of Housing and Urban Development—Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1981, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter which governed grants with respect to such amounts, as such provisions existed prior to

October 1, 1981
, and which have been obligated by 
January 1, 1982
