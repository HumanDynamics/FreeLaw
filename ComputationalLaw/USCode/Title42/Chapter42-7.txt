 Definitions
(a)
 For the purposes of this subchapter, the term “old-age assistance” means money payments to, or (if provided in or after the third month before the month in which the recipient makes application for assistance) medical care in behalf of or any type of remedial care recognized under State law in behalf of, needy individuals who are 65 years of age or older, but does not include any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution). Such term also includes payments which are not included within the meaning of such term under the preceding sentence, but which would be so included except that they are made on behalf of such a needy individual to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such needy individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under 
section 302 of this title
 includes provision for—
(1)
 determination by the State agency that such needy individual has, by reason of his physical or mental condition, such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to his welfare and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such assistance through payments described in this sentence;




(2)
 making such payments only in cases in which such payments will, under the rules otherwise applicable under the State plan for determining need and the amount of old-age assistance to be paid (and in conjunction with other income and resources), meet all the need of the individuals with respect to whom such payments are made;




(3)
 undertaking and continuing special efforts to protect the welfare of such individual and to improve, to the extent possible, his capacity for self-care and to manage funds;




(4)
 periodic review by such State agency of the determination under paragraph (1) of this subsection to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in 
section 1311 of this title
, if and when it appears that such action will best serve the interests of such needy individual; and




(5)
 opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection for any individual with respect to whom it is made.





At the option of a State (if its plan approved under this subchapter so provides), such term (i) need not include money payments to an individual who has been absent from such State for a period in excess of 90 consecutive days (regardless of whether he has maintained his residence in such State during such period) until he has been present in such State for 30 consecutive days in the case of such an individual who has maintained his residence in such State during such period or 90 consecutive days in the case of any other such individual, and (ii) may include rent payments made directly to a public housing agency on behalf of a recipient or a group or groups of recipients of assistance under such plan.

 Board of Trustees; duties; reports to Congress
With respect to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund (hereinafter in this subchapter called the “Trust Funds”) there is hereby created a body to be known as the Board of Trustees of the Trust Funds (hereinafter in this subchapter called the “Board of Trustees”) which Board of Trustees shall be composed of the Commissioner of Social Security, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, all ex officio, and of two members of the public (both of whom may not be from the same political party), who shall be nominated by the President for a term of four years and subject to confirmation by the Senate. A member of the Board of Trustees serving as a member of the public and nominated and confirmed to fill a vacancy occurring during a term shall be nominated and confirmed only for the remainder of such term. An individual nominated and confirmed as a member of the public may serve in such position after the expiration of such member’s term until the earlier of the time at which the member’s successor takes office or the time at which a report of the Board is first issued under paragraph (2) after the expiration of the member’s term. The Secretary of the Treasury shall be the Managing Trustee of the Board of Trustees (hereinafter in this subchapter called the “Managing Trustee”). The Deputy Commissioner of Social Security shall serve as Secretary of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall meet not less frequently than once each calendar year. It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees to—
(1)
 Hold the Trust Funds;




(2)
 Report to the Congress not later than the first day of April of each year on the operation and status of the Trust Funds during the preceding fiscal year and on their expected operation and status during the next ensuing five fiscal years;




(3)
 Report immediately to the Congress whenever the Board of Trustees is of the opinion that the amount of either of the Trust Funds is unduly small;




(4)
 Recommend improvements in administrative procedures and policies designed to effectuate the proper coordination of the old-age and survivors insurance and Federal-State unemployment compensation program; and




(5)
 Review the general policies followed in managing the Trust Funds, and recommend changes in such policies, including necessary changes in the provisions of the law which govern the way in which the Trust Funds are to be managed.





The report provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection shall include a statement of the assets of, and the disbursements made from, the Trust Funds during the preceding fiscal year, an estimate of the expected future income to, and disbursements to be made from, the Trust Funds during each of the next ensuing five fiscal years, and a statement of the actuarial status of the Trust Funds. Such statement shall include a finding by the Board of Trustees as to whether the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, individually and collectively, are in close actuarial balance (as defined by the Board of Trustees). Such report shall include an actuarial opinion by the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration certifying that the techniques and methodologies used are generally accepted within the actuarial profession and that the assumptions and cost estimates used are reasonable. Such report shall also include an actuarial analysis of the benefit disbursements made from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund with respect to disabled beneficiaries. Such report shall be printed as a House document of the session of the Congress to which the report is made. A person serving on the Board of Trustees shall not be considered to be a fiduciary and shall not be personally liable for actions taken in such capacity with respect to the Trust Funds.


(d)
 Investments
It shall be the duty of the Managing Trustee to invest such portion of the Trust Funds as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of public-debt obligations for purchase by the Trust Funds. Such obligations issued for purchase by the Trust Funds shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the Trust Funds and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield (computed by the Managing Trustee on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue) on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of four years from the end of such calendar month; except that where such average market yield is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such market yield. Each obligation issued for purchase by the Trust Funds under this subsection shall be evidenced by a paper instrument in the form of a bond, note, or certificate of indebtedness issued by the Secretary of the Treasury setting forth the principal amount, date of maturity, and interest rate of the obligation, and stating on its face that the obligation shall be incontestable in the hands of the Trust Fund to which it is issued, that the obligation is supported by the full faith and credit of the United States, and that the United States is pledged to the payment of the obligation with respect to both principal and interest. The Managing Trustee may purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, on original issue or at the market price, only where he determines that the purchase of such other obligations is in the public interest.




(e)
 Sale of acquired obligations
Any obligations acquired by the Trust Funds (except public-debt obligations issued exclusively to the Trust Funds) may be sold by the Managing Trustee at the market price, and such public-debt obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.




(f)
 Proceeds from sale or redemption of obligations; interest
The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, respectively. Payment from the general fund of the Treasury to either of the Trust Funds of any such interest or proceeds shall be in the form of paper checks drawn on such general fund to the order of such Trust Fund.

(C)
(i)
 The full amount of all loans made under paragraph (1) (whether made before or after 
January 1, 1983
) shall be repaid at the earliest feasible date and in any event no later than 
December 31, 1989
.

 the balance in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, reduced by the outstanding amount of any loan (including interest thereon) theretofore made to such Trust Fund under this subsection, as of the last day of the second month preceding such month, to




(ii)
 the amount obtained by multiplying by twelve the total amount which (as estimated by the Secretary) will be paid from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund during the month for which such ratio is to be determined (other than payments of interest on, or repayments of loans from another Trust Fund under this subsection), and reducing the amount of any transfers to the Railroad Retirement Account by the amount of any transfer into the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund from that Account.

 the end of the twelfth month immediately succeeding such month in any case where the individual (i) is filing application for a benefit under subsection (e) or (f) of this section, and satisfies paragraph (1)(B) of such subsection by reason of clause (ii) thereof, or (ii) is filing application for a benefit under subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of a person entitled to disability insurance benefits, or




(B)
 the end of the sixth month immediately succeeding such month in any case where subparagraph (A) does not apply.





Any benefit under this subchapter for a month prior to the month in which application is filed shall be reduced, to any extent that may be necessary, so that it will not render erroneous any benefit which, before the filing of such application, the Commissioner of Social Security has certified for payment for such prior month.




(2)
 An application for any monthly benefits under this section filed before the first month in which the applicant satisfies the requirements for such benefits shall be deemed a valid application (and shall be deemed to have been filed in such first month) only if the applicant satisfies the requirements for such benefits before the Commissioner of Social Security makes a final decision on the application and no request under 
section 405(b) of this title
 for notice and opportunity for a hearing thereon is made or, if such a request is made, before a decision based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing is made (regardless of whether such decision becomes the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security).




(3)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), an individual may, at his option, waive entitlement to any benefit referred to in paragraph (1) for any one or more consecutive months (beginning with the earliest month for which such individual would otherwise be entitled to such benefit) which occur before the month in which such individual files application for such benefit; and, in such case, such individual shall not be considered as entitled to such benefits for any such month or months before such individual filed such application. An individual shall be deemed to have waived such entitlement for any such month for which such benefit would, under the second sentence of paragraph (1), be reduced to zero.




(4)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no individual shall be entitled to a monthly benefit under subsection (a), (b), (c), (e), or (f) of this section for any month prior to the month in which he or she files an application for benefits under that subsection if the amount of the monthly benefit to which such individual would otherwise be entitled for any such month would be subject to reduction pursuant to subsection (q) of this section.




(B)
(i)
 If the individual applying for retroactive benefits is a widow, surviving divorced wife, or widower and is under a disability (as defined in 
section 423(d) of this title
), and such individual would, except for subparagraph (A), be entitled to retroactive benefits as a disabled widow or widower or disabled surviving divorced wife for any month before attaining the age of 60, then subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to such month or any subsequent month.




(ii)
 Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a benefit under subsection (e) or (f) of this section for the month immediately preceding the month of application, if the insured individual died in that preceding month.




(iii)
 As used in this subparagraph, the term “retroactive benefits” means benefits to which an individual becomes entitled for a month prior to the month in which application for such benefits is filed.








(5)
 In any case in which it is determined to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that an individual failed as of any date to apply for monthly insurance benefits under this subchapter by reason of misinformation provided to such individual by any officer or employee of the Social Security Administration relating to such individual’s eligibility for benefits under this subchapter, such individual shall be deemed to have applied for such benefits on the later of—
(A)
 the date on which such misinformation was provided to such individual, or




(B)
 the date on which such individual met all requirements for entitlement to such benefits (other than application therefor).






(k)
 Simultaneous entitlement to benefits
(1)
 A child, entitled to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an insured individual, who would be entitled, on filing application, to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of some other insured individual, shall be deemed entitled, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such other individual if an application for child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such other individual has been filed by any other child who would, on filing application, be entitled to child’s insurance benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of both such insured individuals.




(2)
(A)
 Any child who under the preceding provisions of this section is entitled for any month to child’s insurance benefits on the wages and self-employment income of more than one insured individual shall, notwithstanding such provisions, be entitled to only one of such child’s insurance benefits for such month. Such child’s insurance benefits for such month shall be the benefit based on the wages and self-employment income of the insured individual who has the greatest primary insurance amount, except that such child’s insurance benefits for such month shall be the largest benefit to which such child could be entitled under subsection (d) of this section (without the application of 
section 403(a) of this title
) or subsection (m) of this section if entitlement to such benefit would not, with respect to any person, result in a benefit lower (after the application of 
section 403(a) of this title
) than the benefit which would be applicable if such child were entitled on the wages and self-employment income of the individual with the greatest primary insurance amount. Where more than one child is entitled to child’s insurance benefits pursuant to the preceding provisions of this paragraph, each such child who is entitled on the wages and self-employment income of the same insured individuals shall be entitled on the wages and self-employment income of the same such insured individual.




(B)
 Any individual (other than an individual to whom subsection (e)(3) or (f)(3) of this section applies) who, under the preceding provisions of this section and under the provisions of 
section 423 of this title
, is entitled for any month to more than one monthly insurance benefit (other than an old-age or disability insurance benefit) under this subchapter shall be entitled to only one such monthly benefit for such month, such benefit to be the largest of the monthly benefits to which he (but for this subparagraph) would otherwise be entitled for such month. Any individual who is entitled for any month to more than one widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit to which subsection (e)(3) or (f)(3) of this section applies shall be entitled to only one such benefit for such month, such benefit to be the largest of such benefits.






(3)
(A)
 If an individual is entitled to an old-age or disability insurance benefit for any month and to any other monthly insurance benefit for such month, such other insurance benefit for such month, after any reduction under subsection (q), subsection (e)(2) or (f)(2) of this section, and any reduction under 
section 403(a) of this title
, shall be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to such old-age or disability insurance benefit (after reduction under such subsection (q) of this section).




(B)
 If an individual is entitled for any month to a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit to which subsection (e)(3) or (f)(3) of this section applies and to any other monthly insurance benefit under this section (other than an old-age insurance benefit), such other insurance benefit for such month, after any reduction under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, any reduction under subsection (q) of this section, and any reduction under 
section 403(a) of this title
, shall be reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to such widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit after any reduction or reductions under such subparagraph (A) and such section 403(a).






(4)
 Any individual who, under this section and 
section 423 of this title
, is entitled for any month to both an old-age insurance benefit and a disability insurance benefit under this subchapter shall be entitled to only the larger of such benefits for such month, except that, if such individual so elects, he shall instead be entitled to only the smaller of such benefits for such month.




(5)
(A)
 The amount of a monthly insurance benefit of any individual for each month under subsection (b), (c), (e), (f), or (g) of this section (as determined after application of the provisions of subsection (q) of this section and the preceding provisions of this subsection) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to two-thirds of the amount of any monthly periodic benefit payable to such individual for such month which is based upon such individual’s earnings while in the service of the Federal Government or any State (or political subdivision thereof, as defined in 
section 418(b)(2) of this title
) if, during any portion of the last 60 months of such service ending with the last day such individual was employed by such entity—
(i)
 such service did not constitute “employment” as defined in 
section 410 of this title
, or




(ii)
 such service was being performed while in the service of the Federal Government, and constituted “employment” as so defined solely by reason of—
(I)
 clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (G) of 
section 410(a)(5) of this title
, where the lump-sum payment described in such clause (ii) or the cessation of coverage described in such clause (iii) (whichever is applicable) was received or occurred on or after 
January 1, 1988
, or




(II)
 an election to become subject to the Federal Employees’ Retirement System provided in chapter 84 of title 5 or the Foreign Service Pension System provided in subchapter II of chapter 8 of title I of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [
22 U.S.C. 4071
 et seq.] made pursuant to law after 
December 31, 1987
,





unless subparagraph (B) applies.





The amount of the reduction in any benefit under this subparagraph, if not a multiple of $0.10, shall be rounded to the next higher multiple of $0.10.




(B)
(i)
 Subparagraph (A)(i) shall not apply with respect to monthly periodic benefits based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in 
section 410(m) of this title
).




(ii)
 Subparagraph (A)(ii) shall not apply with respect to monthly periodic benefits based in whole or in part on service which constituted “employment” as defined in 
section 410 of this title
 if such service was performed for at least 60 months in the aggregate during the period beginning 
January 1, 1988
, and ending with the close of the first calendar month as of the end of which such individual is eligible for benefits under this subsection and has made a valid application for such benefits.






(C)
 For purposes of this paragraph, any periodic benefit which otherwise meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), but which is paid on other than a monthly basis, shall be allocated on a basis equivalent to a monthly benefit (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) and such equivalent monthly benefit shall constitute a monthly periodic benefit for purposes of subparagraph (A). For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “periodic benefit” includes a benefit payable in a lump sum if it is a commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments.






(l)
 Entitlement to survivor benefits under railroad retirement provisions
If any person would be entitled, upon filing application therefor to an annuity under section 2 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [
45 U.S.C. 231a
], or to a lump-sum payment under section 6(b) of such Act [
45 U.S.C. 231e(b)
], with respect to the death of an employee (as defined in such Act) no lump-sum death payment, and no monthly benefit for the month in which such employee died or for any month thereafter, shall be paid under this section to any person on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such employee.

(C)
 no lump-sum death payment shall be made on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income if he dies (i) in or after the month in which such notice is received, and (ii) before the month in which he is thereafter lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.





Section 403(b), (c), and (d) of this title shall not apply with respect to any such individual for any month for which no monthly benefit may be paid to him by reason of this paragraph.




(2)
 As soon as practicable after the removal of any individual under any of the paragraphs of 
section 1227(a) of title 8
 (other than under paragraph (1)(C) of such section) or under

any such proof or application, as the case may be, which is filed after the expiration of such period shall be deemed to have been filed within such period if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that there was good cause for failure to file such proof or application within such period. The determination of what constitutes good cause for purposes of this subsection shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security.


(q)
 Reduction of benefit amounts for certain beneficiaries
(1)
 Subject to paragraph (9), if the first month for which an individual is entitled to an old-age, wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit is a month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age, the amount of such benefit for such month and for any subsequent month shall, subject to the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, be reduced by—
(A)
 
5
⁄
9
 of 1 percent of such amount if such benefit is an old-age insurance benefit, 
25
⁄
36
 of 1 percent of such amount if such benefit is a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit, or 
19
⁄
40
 of 1 percent of such amount if such benefit is a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit, multiplied by




(B)
(i)
 the number of months in the reduction period for such benefit (determined under paragraph (6)), if such benefit is for a month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age, or




(ii)
 if less, the number of such months in the adjusted reduction period for such benefit (determined under paragraph (7)), if such benefit is (I) for the month in which such individual attains age 62, or (II) for the month in which such individual attains retirement age.








(2)
 If an individual is entitled to a disability insurance benefit for a month after a month for which such individual was entitled to an old-age insurance benefit, such disability insurance benefit for each month shall be reduced by the amount such old-age insurance benefit would be reduced under paragraphs (1) and (4) for such month had such individual attained retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) in the first month for which he most recently became entitled to a disability insurance benefit.




(3)
(A)
 If the first month for which an individual both is entitled to a wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit and has attained age 62 (in the case of a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit) or age 50 (in the case of a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit) is a month for which such individual is also entitled to—
(i)
 an old-age insurance benefit (to which such individual was first entitled for a month before he attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title)), or




(ii)
 a disability insurance benefit,





then in lieu of any reduction under paragraph (1) (but subject to the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection) such wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit for each month shall be reduced as provided in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D).




(B)
 For any month for which such individual is entitled to an old-age insurance benefit and is not entitled to a disability insurance benefit, such individual’s wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit shall be reduced by the sum of—
(i)
 the amount by which such old-age insurance benefit is reduced under paragraph (1) for such month, and




(ii)
 the amount by which such wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit would be reduced under paragraph (1) for such month if it were equal to the excess of such wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection) over such old-age insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection).






(C)
 For any month for which such individual is entitled to a disability insurance benefit, such individual’s wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit shall be reduced by the sum of—

(ii)
 the amount by which such wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit would be reduced under paragraph (1) for such month if it were equal to the excess of such wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection) over such disability insurance benefit (before reduction under this subsection).






(D)
 For any month for which such individual is entitled neither to an old-age insurance benefit nor to a disability insurance benefit, such individual’s wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit shall be reduced by the amount by which it would be reduced under paragraph (1).




(E)
 Notwithstanding subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, if the first month for which an individual is entitled to a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit is a month for which such individual is also entitled to an old-age insurance benefit to which such individual was first entitled for that month or for a month before she or he became entitled to a widow’s or widower’s benefit, the reduction in such widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit shall be determined under paragraph (1).






(4)
 If—
(A)
 an individual is or was entitled to a benefit subject to reduction under paragraph (1) or (3) of this subsection, and




(B)
 such benefit is increased by reason of an increase in the primary insurance amount of the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based,





then the amount of the reduction of such benefit (after the application of any adjustment under paragraph (7)) for each month beginning with the month of such increase in the primary insurance amount shall be computed under paragraph (1) or (3), whichever applies, as though the increased primary insurance amount had been in effect for and after the month for which the individual first became entitled to such monthly benefit reduced under such paragraph (1) or (3).




(5)
(A)
 No wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit shall be reduced under this subsection—
(i)
 for any month before the first month for which there is in effect a certificate filed by him or her with the Commissioner of Social Security, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security, in which he or she elects to receive wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits reduced as provided in this subsection, or




(ii)
 for any month in which he or she has in his or her care (individually or jointly with the person on whose wages and self-employment income the wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit is based) a child of such person entitled to child’s insurance benefits.






(B)
 Any certificate described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be effective for purposes of this subsection (and for purposes of preventing deductions under 
section 403(c)(2) of this title
)—
(i)
 for the month in which it is filed and for any month thereafter, and




(ii)
 for months, in the period designated by the individual filing such certificate, of one or more consecutive months (not exceeding 12) immediately preceding the month in which such certificate is filed;





except that such certificate shall not be effective for any month before the month in which he or she attains age 62, nor shall it be effective for any month to which subparagraph (A)(ii) applies.




(C)
 If an individual does not have in his or her care a child described in subparagraph (A)(ii) in the first month for which he or she is entitled to a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit, and if such first month is a month before the month in which he or she attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title), he or she shall be deemed to have filed in such first month the certificate described in subparagraph (A)(i).




(D)
 No widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit for a month in which he or she has in his or her care a child of his or her deceased spouse (or deceased former spouse) entitled to child’s insurance benefits shall be reduced under this subsection below the amount to which he or she would have been entitled had he or she been entitled for such month to mother’s or father’s insurance benefits on the basis of his or her deceased spouse’s (or deceased former spouse’s) wages and self-employment income.






(6)
 For purposes of this subsection, the “reduction period” for an individual’s old-age, wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit is the period—

 beginning—
(i)
 in the case of an old-age insurance benefit, with the first day of the first month for which such individual is entitled to such benefit,




(ii)
 in the case of a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit, with the first day of the first month for which a certificate described in paragraph (5)(A)(i) is effective, or




(iii)
 in the case of a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit, with the first day of the first month for which such individual is entitled to such benefit or the first day of the month in which such individual attains age 60, whichever is the later, and






(B)
 ending with the last day of the month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age.






(7)
 For purposes of this subsection, the “adjusted reduction period” for an individual’s old-age, wife’s, husband’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit is the reduction period prescribed in paragraph (6) for such benefit, excluding—
(A)
 any month in which such benefit was subject to deductions under section 403(b), 403(c)(1), 403(d)(1), or 422(b) of this title,




(B)
 in the case of wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits, any month in which such individual had in his or her care (individually or jointly with the person on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based) a child of such person entitled to child’s insurance benefits,




(C)
 in the case of wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits, any month for which such individual was not entitled to such benefits because of the occurrence of an event that terminated her or his entitlement to such benefits,




(D)
 in the case of widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits, any month in which the reduction in the amount of such benefit was determined under paragraph (5)(D),




(E)
 in the case of widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits, any month before the month in which she or he attained age 62, and also for any later month before the month in which she or he attained retirement age, for which she or he was not entitled to such benefit because of the occurrence of an event that terminated her or his entitlement to such benefits, and




(F)
 in the case of old-age insurance benefits, any month for which such individual was entitled to a disability insurance benefit.






(8)
 This subsection shall be applied after reduction under 
section 403(a) of this title
 and before application of 
section 415(g) of this title
. If the amount of any reduction computed under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) is not a multiple of $0.10, it shall be increased to the next higher multiple of $0.10.




(9)
 The amount of the reduction for early retirement specified in paragraph (1)—
(A)
 for old-age insurance benefits, wife’s insurance benefits, and husband’s insurance benefits, shall be the amount specified in such paragraph for the first 36 months of the reduction period (as defined in paragraph (6)) or adjusted reduction period (as defined in paragraph (7)), and five-twelfths of 1 percent for any additional months included in such periods; and




(B)
 for widow’s insurance benefits and widower’s insurance benefits, shall be periodically revised by the Commissioner of Social Security such that—
(i)
 the amount of the reduction at early retirement age as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title shall be 28.5 percent of the full benefit; and




(ii)
 the amount of the reduction for each month in the reduction period (specified in paragraph (6)) or the adjusted reduction period (specified in paragraph (7)) shall be established by linear interpolation between 28.5 percent at the month of attainment of early retirement age and 0 percent at the month of attainment of retirement age.








(10)
 For purposes of applying paragraph (4), with respect to monthly benefits payable for any month after December 1977 to an individual who was entitled to a monthly benefit as reduced under paragraph (1) or (3) prior to January 1978, the amount of reduction in such benefit for the first month for which such benefit is increased by reason of an increase in the primary insurance amount of the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit is based and for all subsequent months (and similarly for all subsequent increases) shall be increased by a percentage equal to the percentage increase in such primary insurance amount (such increase being made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (8)). In the case of an individual whose reduced benefit under this section is increased as a result of the use of an adjusted reduction period (in accordance with paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subsection), then for the first month for which such increase is effective, and for all subsequent months, the amount of such reduction (after the application of the previous sentence, if applicable) shall be determined—
(A)
 in the case of old-age, wife’s, and husband’s insurance benefits, by multiplying such amount by the ratio of (i) the number of months in the adjusted reduction period to (ii) the number of months in the reduction period,




(B)
 in the case of widow’s and widower’s insurance benefits for the month in which such individual attains age 62, by multiplying such amount by the ratio of (i) the number of months in the reduction period beginning with age 62 multiplied by 
19
⁄
40
 of 1 percent, plus the number of months in the adjusted reduction period prior to age 62 multiplied by 
19
⁄
40
 of 1 percent to (ii) the number of months in the reduction period multiplied by 
19
⁄
40
 of 1 percent, and




(C)
 in the case of widow’s and widower’s insurance benefits for the month in which such individual attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title), by multiplying such amount by the ratio of (i) the number of months in the adjusted reduction period multiplied by 
19
⁄
40
 of 1 percent to (ii) the number of months in the reduction period beginning with age 62 multiplied by 
19
⁄
40
 of 1 percent, plus the number of months in the adjusted reduction period prior to age 62 multiplied by 
19
⁄
40
 of 1 percent,





such determination being made in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (8).




(11)
 When an individual is entitled to more than one monthly benefit under this subchapter and one or more of such benefits are reduced under this subsection, paragraph (10) shall apply separately to each such benefit reduced under this subsection before the application of subsection (k) of this section (pertaining to the method by which monthly benefits are offset when an individual is entitled to more than one kind of benefit) and the application of this paragraph shall operate in conjunction with paragraph (3).

l
) of this title), and if such individual is eligible for a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit for such first month, such individual shall be deemed to have filed an application in such month for wife’s or husband’s insurance benefits.




(2)
 If the first month for which an individual is entitled to a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit reduced under subsection (q) of this section is a month before the month in which such individual attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title), and if such individual is eligible (but for subsection (k)(4) of this section) for an old-age insurance benefit for such first month, such individual shall be deemed to have filed an application for old-age insurance benefits—
(A)
 in such month, or




(B)
 if such individual is also entitled to a disability insurance benefit for such month, in the first subsequent month for which such individual is not entitled to a disability insurance benefit.






(3)
 For purposes of this subsection, an individual shall be deemed eligible for a benefit for a month if, upon filing application therefor in such month, he would be entitled to such benefit for such month.

(B)
 such individual’s primary insurance amount is increased for the following month under any provision of this subchapter,





then the total of monthly benefits for all persons on the basis of such wages and self-employment income for such particular month, as determined under the provisions of this subsection, shall for purposes of determining the total monthly benefits for all persons on the basis of such wages and self-employment income for months subsequent to such particular month be considered to have been increased by the smallest amount that would have been required in order to assure that the total of monthly benefits payable on the basis of such wages and self-employment income for any such subsequent month will not be less (after the application of the other provisions of this subsection and 
section 402(q) of this title

) to the smaller of—
(A)
 85 percent of such individual’s average indexed monthly earnings (or 100 percent of his primary insurance amount, if larger), or




(B)
 150 percent of such individual’s primary insurance amount.

section 415(d) of this title
, as in effect after December 1978, the total benefits payable to that individual and all other individuals entitled to benefits for that month based upon those primary insurance amounts shall be reduced to an amount equal to the amount determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (3)(A)(ii) of this subsection, except that for this purpose the references to subparagraph (A) in the last two sentences of paragraph (3)(A) shall be deemed to be references to paragraph (7).

 Subject to paragraph (7) and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (10)(C), this subsection as in effect in December 1978 shall remain in effect with respect to a primary insurance amount computed under section 415(a) or (d) of this title, as in effect (without regard to the table contained therein) in December 1978 and as amended by section 5117 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, except that a primary insurance amount so computed with respect to an individual who first becomes eligible for an old-age or disability insurance benefit, or dies (before becoming eligible for such a benefit), after December 1978, shall instead be governed by this section as in effect after December 1978. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the phrase “rounded to the next higher multiple of $0.10”, as it appeared in subsection (a)(2)(C) of this section as in effect in December 1978, shall be deemed to read “rounded to the next lower multiple of $0.10”.




(9)
 When—
(A)
 one or more persons were entitled (without the application of 
section 402(j)(1) of this title
) to monthly benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for May 1978 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual,




(B)
 the benefit of at least one such person for June 1978 is increased by reason of the amendments made by section 204 of the Social Security Amendments of 1977; and




(C)
 the total amount of benefits to which all such persons are entitled under such 
section 402 of this title
 are reduced under the provisions of this subsection (or would be so reduced except for the first sentence of subsection (a)(4) of this section),





then the amount of the benefit to which each such person is entitled for months after May 1978 shall be increased (after such reductions are made under this subsection) to the amount such benefits would have been if the benefit of the person or persons referred to in subparagraph (B) had not been so increased.




(10)
(A)
 Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C)—
(i)
 the total monthly benefits to which beneficiaries may be entitled under sections 402 and 423 of this title for a month on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual whose primary insurance amount is computed under 
section 415(a)(2)(B)(i) of this title
 shall equal the total monthly benefits which were authorized by this section with respect to such individual’s primary insurance amount for the last month of his prior entitlement to disability insurance benefits, increased for this purpose by the general benefit increases and other increases under 
section 415(i) of this title
 that would have applied to such total monthly benefits had the individual remained entitled to disability insurance benefits until the month in which he became entitled to old-age insurance benefits or reentitled to disability insurance benefits or died, and




(ii)
 the total monthly benefits to which beneficiaries may be entitled under sections 402 and 423 of this title for a month on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual whose primary insurance amount is computed under 
section 415(a)(2)(C) of this title
 shall equal the total monthly benefits which were authorized by this section with respect to such individual’s primary insurance amount for the last month of his prior entitlement to disability insurance benefits.






(B)
 In any case in which—
(i)
 the total monthly benefits with respect to such individual’s primary insurance amount for the last month of his prior entitlement to disability insurance benefits was computed under paragraph (6), and




(ii)
 the individual’s primary insurance amount is computed under subparagraph (B)(i) or (C) of 
section 415(a)(2) of this title
 by reason of the individual’s entitlement to old-age insurance benefits or death,





the total monthly benefits shall equal the total monthly benefits that would have been authorized with respect to the primary insurance amount for the last month of his prior entitlement to disability insurance benefits if such total monthly benefits had been computed without regard to paragraph (6).




(C)
 This paragraph shall apply before the application of paragraph (3)(A), and before the application of subsection (a)(1) of this section as in effect in December 1978.






(b)
 Deductions on account of work
(1)
 Deductions, in such amounts and at such time or times as the Commissioner of Social Security shall determine, shall be made from any payment or payments under this subchapter to which an individual is entitled, and from any payment or payments to which any other persons are entitled on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income, until the total of such deductions equals—
(A)
 such individual’s benefit or benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for any month, and




(B)
 if such individual was entitled to old-age insurance benefits under 
section 402(a) of this title
 for such month, the benefit or benefits of all other persons for such month under 
section 402 of this title
 based on such individual’s wages and self-employment income,





if for such month he is charged with excess earnings, under the provisions of subsection (f) of this section, equal to the total of benefits referred to in clauses (A) and (B). If the excess earnings so charged are less than such total of benefits, such deductions with respect to such month shall be equal only to the amount of such excess earnings. If a child who has attained the age of 18 and is entitled to child’s insurance benefits, or a person who is entitled to mother’s or father’s insurance benefits, is married to an individual entitled to old-age insurance benefits under 
section 402(a) of this title
, such child or such person, as the case may be, shall, for the purposes of this subsection and subsection (f) of this section, be deemed to be entitled to such benefits on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individual entitled to old-age insurance benefits. If a deduction has already been made under this subsection with respect to a person’s benefit or benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for a month, he shall be deemed entitled to payments under such section for such month for purposes of further deductions under this subsection, and for purposes of charging of each person’s excess earnings under subsection (f) of this section, only to the extent of the total of his benefits remaining after such earlier deductions have been made. For purposes of this subsection and subsection (f) of this section—


(i)
 an individual shall be deemed to be entitled to payments under 
section 402 of this title
 equal to the amount of the benefit or benefits to which he is entitled under such section after the application of subsection (a) of this section, but without the application of the first sentence of paragraph (4) thereof; and




(ii)
 if a deduction is made with respect to an individual’s benefit or benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 because of the occurrence in any month of an event specified in subsection (c) or (d) of this section or in section 422(b) 
1
 of this title, such individual shall not be considered to be entitled to any benefits under such section 402 for such month.






(2)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in any case in which—
(i)
 any of the other persons referred to in paragraph (1)(B) is entitled to monthly benefits as a divorced spouse under section 402(b) or (c) of this title for any month, and




(ii)
 such person has been divorced for not less than 2 years,





the benefit to which he or she is entitled on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of the individual referred to in paragraph (1) for such month shall be determined without regard to deductions under this subsection as a result of excess earnings of such individual, and the benefits of all other individuals who are entitled for such month to monthly benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individual referred to in paragraph (1) shall be determined as if no such divorced spouse were entitled to benefits for such month.




(B)
 Clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to any divorced spouse in any case in which the individual referred to in paragraph (1) became entitled to old-age insurance benefits under 
section 402(a) of this title
 before the date of the divorce.






(c)
 Deductions on account of noncovered work outside United States or failure to have child in care
Deductions, in such amounts and at such time or times as the Commissioner of Social Security shall determine, shall be made from any payment or payments under this subchapter to which an individual is entitled, until the total of such deductions equals such individual’s benefits or benefit under 
section 402 of this title
 for any month—
(1)
 in which such individual is under retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) and for more than forty-five hours of which such individual engaged in noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States;




(2)
 in which such individual, if a wife or husband under retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) entitled to a wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit, did not have in his or her care (individually or jointly with his or her spouse) a child of such spouse entitled to a child’s insurance benefit and such wife’s or husband’s insurance benefit for such month was not reduced under the provisions of 
section 402(q) of this title
;




(3)
 in which such individual, if a widow or widower entitled to a mother’s or father’s insurance benefit, did not have in his or her care a child of his or her deceased spouse entitled to a child’s insurance benefit; or




(4)
 in which such an individual, if a surviving divorced mother or father entitled to a mother’s or father’s insurance benefit, did not have in his or her care a child of his or her deceased former spouse who (A) is his or her son, daughter, or legally adopted child and (B) is entitled to a child’s insurance benefit on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such deceased former spouse.





For purposes of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection, a child shall not be considered to be entitled to a child’s insurance benefit for any month in which paragraph (1) of 
section 402(s) of this title
 applies or an event specified in section 422(b) 
1
 of this title occurs with respect to such child. Subject to paragraph (3) of such 
section 402(s) of this title
, no deduction shall be made under this subsection from any child’s insurance benefit for the month in which the child entitled to such benefit attained the age of eighteen or any subsequent month; nor shall any deduction be made under this subsection from any widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit if the widow, surviving divorced wife, widower, or surviving divorced husband involved became entitled to such benefit prior to attaining age 60.


(d)
 Deductions from dependents’ benefits on account of noncovered work outside United States by old-age insurance beneficiary
(1)
(A)
 Deductions shall be made from any wife’s, husband’s, or child’s insurance benefit, based on the wages and self-employment income of an individual entitled to old-age insurance benefits, to which a wife, divorced wife, husband, divorced husband, or child is entitled, until the total of such deductions equals such wife’s, husband’s, or child’s insurance benefit or benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for any month in which such individual is under retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) and for more than forty-five hours of which such individual engaged in noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States.




(B)
(i)
 Except as provided in clause (ii), in any case in which—
(I)
 a divorced spouse is entitled to monthly benefits under section 402(b) or (c) of this title for any month, and




(II)
 such divorced spouse has been divorced for not less than 2 years,





the benefit to which he or she is entitled for such month on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of the individual entitled to old-age insurance benefits referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be determined without regard to deductions under this paragraph as a result of excess earnings of such individual, and the benefits of all other individuals who are entitled for such month to monthly benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individual referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be determined as if no such divorced spouse were entitled to benefits for such month.




(ii)
 Subclause (II) of clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any divorced spouse in any case in which the individual entitled to old-age insurance benefits referred to in subparagraph (A) became entitled to such benefits before the date of the divorce.








(2)
 Deductions shall be made from any child’s insurance benefit to which a child who has attained the age of eighteen is entitled, or from any mother’s or father’s insurance benefit to which a person is entitled, until the total of such deductions equals such child’s insurance benefit or benefits or mother’s or father’s insurance benefit or benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for any month in which such child or person entitled to mother’s or father’s insurance benefits is married to an individual under retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) who is entitled to old-age insurance benefits and for more than forty-five hours of which such individual engaged in noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States.




(e)
 Occurrence of more than one event
If more than one of the events specified in subsections (c) and (d) of this section and section 422(b) 
1
 of this title occurs in any one month which would occasion deductions equal to a benefit for such month, only an amount equal to such benefit shall be deducted.




(f)
 Months to which earnings are charged
For purposes of subsection (b) of this section—
(1)
 The amount of an individual’s excess earnings (as defined in paragraph (3)) shall be charged to months as follows: There shall be charged to the first month of such taxable year an amount of his excess earnings equal to the sum of the payments to which he and all other persons (excluding divorced spouses referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section) are entitled for such month under 
section 402 of this title
 on the basis of his wages and self-employment income (or the total of his excess earnings if such excess earnings are less than such sum), and the balance, if any, of such excess earnings shall be charged to each succeeding month in such year to the extent, in the case of each such month, of the sum of the payments to which such individual and all such other persons are entitled for such month under 
section 402 of this title
 on the basis of his wages and self-employment income, until the total of such excess has been so charged. Where an individual is entitled to benefits under 
section 402(a) of this title
 and other persons (excluding divorced spouses referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section) are entitled to benefits under section 402(b), (c), or (d) of this title on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individual, the excess earnings of such individual for any taxable year shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this subsection before the excess earnings of such persons for a taxable year are charged to months in such individual’s taxable year. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph but subject to 
section 402(s) of this title
, no part of the excess earnings of an individual shall be charged to any month (A) for which such individual was not entitled to a benefit under this subchapter, (B) in which such individual was at or above retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title), (C) in which such individual, if a child entitled to child’s insurance benefits, has attained the age of 18, (D) for which such individual is entitled to widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits if such individual became so entitled prior to attaining age 60, (E) in which such individual did not engage in self-employment and did not render services for wages (determined as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection) of more than the applicable exempt amount as determined under paragraph (8), if such month is in the taxable year in which occurs the first month after December 1977 that is both (i) a month for which the individual is entitled to benefits under subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) of 
section 402 of this title
 (without having been entitled for the preceding month to a benefit under any other of such subsections), and (ii) a month in which the individual did not engage in self-employment and did not render services for wages (determined as provided in paragraph (5)) of more than the applicable exempt amount as determined under paragraph (8), or (F) in which such individual did not engage in self-employment and did not render services for wages (determined as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection) of more than the applicable exempt amount as determined under paragraph (8), in the case of an individual entitled to benefits under section 402(b) or (c) of this title (but only by reason of having a child in his or her care within the meaning of paragraph (1)(B) of subsection (b) or (c) of this section, as may be applicable) or under section 402(d) or (g) of this title, if such month is in a year in which such entitlement ends for a reason other than the death of such individual, and such individual is not entitled to any benefits under this subchapter for the month following the month during which such entitlement under section 402(b), (d), or (g) of this title ended.




(2)
 As used in paragraph (1), the term “first month of such taxable year” means the earliest month in such year to which the charging of excess earnings described in such paragraph is not prohibited by the application of clauses (A), (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) thereof.




(3)
 For purposes of paragraph (1) and subsection (h) of this section, an individual’s excess earnings for a taxable year shall be 33⅓ percent of his earnings for such year in excess of the product of the applicable exempt amount as determined under paragraph (8) in the case of an individual who has attained (or, but for the individual’s death, would have attained) retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) before the close of such taxable year, or 50 percent of his earnings for such year in excess of such product in the case of any other individual, multiplied by the number of months in such year, except that, in determining an individual’s excess earnings for the taxable year in which he attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title), there shall be excluded any earnings of such individual for the month in which he attains such age and any subsequent month (with any net earnings or net loss from self-employment in such year being prorated in an equitable manner under regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security). For purposes of the preceding sentence, notwithstanding 
section 411(e) of this title
, the number of months in the taxable year in which an individual dies shall be 12. The excess earnings as derived under the first sentence of this paragraph, if not a multiple of $1, shall be reduced to the next lower multiple of $1.




(4)
 For purposes of clause (E) of paragraph (1)—
(A)
 An individual will be presumed, with respect to any month, to have been engaged in self-employment in such month until it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that such individual rendered no substantial services in such month with respect to any trade or business the net income or loss of which is includible in computing (as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection) his net earnings or net loss from self-employment for any taxable year. The Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulations prescribe the methods and criteria for determining whether or not an individual has rendered substantial services with respect to any trade or business.




(B)
 An individual will be presumed, with respect to any month, to have rendered services for wages (determined as provided in paragraph (5) of this subsection) of more than the applicable exempt amount as determined under paragraph (8) until it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that such individual did not render such services in such month for more than such amount.






(5)
(A)
 An individual’s earnings for a taxable year shall be (i) the sum of his wages for services rendered in such year and his net earnings from self-employment for such year, minus (ii) any net loss from self-employment for such year.




(B)
 For purposes of this section—
(i)
 an individual’s net earnings from self-employment for any taxable year shall be determined as provided in 
section 411 of this title
, except that paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of 
section 411(c) of this title
 shall not apply and the gross income shall be computed by excluding the amounts provided by subparagraph (D) of this paragraph, and




(ii)
 an individual’s net loss from self-employment for any taxable year is the excess of the deductions (plus his distributive share of loss described in section 702(a)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) taken into account under clause (i) over the gross income (plus his distributive share of income so described) taken into account under clause (i).






(C)
 For purposes of this subsection, an individual’s wages shall be computed without regard to the limitations as to amounts of remuneration specified in paragraphs (1), (6)(B), (6)(C), (7)(B), and (8) of 
section 409(a) of this title
; and in making such computation services which do not constitute employment as defined in 
section 410 of this title
, performed within the United States by the individual as an employee or performed outside the United States in the active military or naval service of the United States, shall be deemed to be employment as so defined if the remuneration for such services is not includible in computing his net earnings or net loss from self-employment. The term “wages” does not include—
(i)
 the amount of any payment made to, or on behalf of, an employee or any of his dependents (including any amount paid by an employer for insurance or annuities, or into a fund, to provide for any such payment) on account of retirement, or




(ii)
 any payment or series of payments by an employer to an employee or any of his dependents upon or after the termination of the employee’s employment relationship because of retirement after attaining an age specified in a plan referred to in 
section 409(a)(11)(B) of this title
 or in a pension plan of the employer.






(D)
 In the case of—
(i)
 an individual who has attained retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) on or before the last day of the taxable year, and who shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that he or she is receiving royalties attributable to a copyright or patent obtained before the taxable year in which he or she attained such age and that the property to which the copyright or patent relates was created by his or her own personal efforts, or




(ii)
 an individual who has become entitled to insurance benefits under this subchapter, other than benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 or benefits payable under 
section 402(d) of this title
 by reason of being under a disability, and who shows to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that he or she is receiving, in a year after his or her initial year of entitlement to such benefits, any other income not attributable to services performed after the month in which he or she initially became entitled to such benefits,





there shall be excluded from gross income any such royalties or other income.




(E)
 For purposes of this section, any individual’s net earnings from self-employment which result from or are attributable to the performance of services by such individual as a director of a corporation during any taxable year shall be deemed to have been derived (and received) by such individual in that year, at the time the services were performed, regardless of when the income, on which the computation of such net earnings from self-employment is based, is actually paid to or received by such individual (unless such income was actually paid and received prior to that year).






(6)
 For purposes of this subsection, wages (determined as provided in paragraph (5)(C)) which, according to reports received by the Commissioner of Social Security, are paid to an individual during a taxable year shall be presumed to have been paid to him for services performed in such year until it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that they were paid for services performed in another taxable year. If such reports with respect to an individual show his wages for a calendar year, such individual’s taxable year shall be presumed to be a calendar year for purposes of this subsection until it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that his taxable year is not a calendar year.




(7)
 Where an individual’s excess earnings are charged to a month and the excess earnings so charged are less than the total of the payments (without regard to such charging) to which all persons (excluding divorced spouses referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section) are entitled under 
section 402 of this title
 for such month on the basis of his wages and self-employment income, the difference between such total and the excess so charged to such month shall be paid (if it is otherwise payable under this subchapter) to such individual and other persons in the proportion that the benefit to which each of them is entitled (without regard to such charging, without the application of 
section 402(k)(3) of this title
, and prior to the application of 
section 403(a) of this title
) bears to the total of the benefits to which all of them are entitled.




(8)

section 415(i) of this title
 increases benefits effective with the month of December following a cost-of-living computation quarter 
2
2
 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma.
 the Commissioner shall also determine and publish in the Federal Register on or before November 1 of the calendar year in which such quarter occurs the new exempt amounts (separately stated for individuals described in subparagraph (D) and for other individuals) which are to be applicable (unless prevented from becoming effective by subparagraph (C)) with respect to taxable years ending in (or with the close of) the calendar year after the calendar year in which such benefit increase is effective (or, in the case of an individual who dies during the calendar year after the calendar year in which the benefit increase is effective, with respect to such individual’s taxable year which ends, upon his death, during such year).




(B)
 Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (D), the exempt amount which is applicable to individuals described in such subparagraph and the exempt amount which is applicable to other individuals, for each month of a particular taxable year, shall each be whichever of the following is the larger—
(i)
 the corresponding exempt amount which is in effect with respect to months in the taxable year in which the determination under subparagraph (A) is made, or




(ii)
 the product of the corresponding exempt amount which is in effect with respect to months in the taxable year ending after 2001 and before 2003 (with respect to individuals described in subparagraph (D)) or the taxable year ending after 1993 and before 1995 (with respect to other individuals), and the ratio of—
(I)
 the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
) for the calendar year before the calendar year in which the determination under subparagraph (A) is made, to




(II)
 the national average wage index (as so defined) for 2000 (with respect to individuals described in subparagraph (D)) or 1992 (with respect to other individuals),





with such product, if not a multiple of $10, being rounded to the next higher multiple of $10 where such product is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest multiple of $10 in any other case.





Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security determines that an exempt amount is to be increased in any year under this paragraph, the Commissioner shall notify the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance within 30 days after the close of the base quarter (as defined in 
section 415(i)(1)(A) of this title
) in such year of the estimated amount of such increase, indicating the new exempt amount, the actuarial estimates of the effect of the increase, and the actuarial assumptions and methodology used in preparing such estimates.




(C)
 Notwithstanding the determination of a new exempt amount by the Commissioner of Social Security under subparagraph (A) (and notwithstanding any publication thereof under such subparagraph or any notification thereof under the last sentence of subparagraph (B)), such new exempt amount shall not take effect pursuant thereto if during the calendar year in which such determination is made a law increasing the exempt amount is enacted.




(D)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the exempt amount which is applicable to an individual who has attained retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) before the close of the taxable year involved shall be—
(i)
 for each month of any taxable year ending after 1995 and before 1997, $1,041.66⅔,




(ii)
 for each month of any taxable year ending after 1996 and before 1998, $1,125.00,

(vi)
 for each month of any taxable year ending after 2000 and before 2002, $2,083.33⅓, and




(vii)
 for each month of any taxable year ending after 2001 and before 2003, $2,500.00.






(E)
 Notwithstanding subparagraph (D), no deductions in benefits shall be made under subsection (b) of this section with respect to the earnings of any individual in any month beginning with the month in which the individual attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title).






(9)
 For purposes of paragraphs (3), (5)(D)(i), (8)(D), and (8)(E), the term “retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title)”, with respect to any individual entitled to monthly insurance benefits under 
section 402 of this title
, means the retirement age (as so defined) which is applicable in the case of old-age insurance benefits, regardless of whether or not the particular benefits to which the individual is entitled (or the only such benefits) are old-age insurance benefits.




(g)
 Penalty for failure to report certain events
Any individual in receipt of benefits subject to deduction under subsection (c) of this section, (or who is in receipt of such benefits on behalf of another individual), because of the occurrence of an event specified therein, who fails to report such occurrence to the Commissioner of Social Security prior to the receipt and acceptance of an insurance benefit for the second month following the month in which such event occurred, shall suffer deductions in addition to those imposed under subsection (c) of this section as follows:
(1)
 if such failure is the first one with respect to which an additional deduction is imposed by this subsection, such additional deduction shall be equal to his benefit or benefits for the first month of the period for which there is a failure to report even though such failure is with respect to more than one month;




(2)
 if such failure is the second one with respect to which an additional deduction is imposed by this subsection, such additional deduction shall be equal to two times his benefit or benefits for the first month of the period for which there is a failure to report even though such failure is with respect to more than two months; and




(3)
 if such failure is the third or a subsequent one for which an additional deduction is imposed under this subsection, such additional deduction shall be equal to three times his benefit or benefits for the first month of the period for which there is a failure to report even though the failure to report is with respect to more than three months;





except that the number of additional deductions required by this subsection shall not exceed the number of months in the period for which there is a failure to report. As used in this subsection, the term “period for which there is a failure to report” with respect to any individual means the period for which such individual received and accepted insurance benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 without making a timely report and for which deductions are required under subsection (c) of this section.


(h)

 If an individual is entitled to any monthly insurance benefit under 
section 402 of this title
 during any taxable year in which he has earnings or wages, as computed pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection (f) of this section, in excess of the product of the applicable exempt amount as determined under subsection (f)(8) of this section times the number of months in such year, such individual (or the individual who is in receipt of such benefit on his behalf) shall make a report to the Commissioner of Social Security of his earnings (or wages) for such taxable year. Such report shall be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of such year, and shall contain such information and be made in such manner as the Commissioner of Social Security may by regulations prescribe. Such report need not be made for any taxable year—
(i)
 beginning with or after the month in which such individual attained retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title), or




(ii)
 if benefit payments for all months (in such taxable year) in which such individual is under retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title) have been suspended under the provisions of the first sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection, unless—
(I)
 such individual is entitled to benefits under subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) of 
section 402 of this title
,




(II)
 such benefits are reduced under subsection (a) of this section for any month in such taxable year, and




(III)
 in any such month there is another person who also is entitled to benefits under subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g), or (h) of 
section 402 of this title
 on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income and who does not live in the same household as such individual.







The Commissioner of Social Security may grant a reasonable extension of time for making the report of earnings required in this paragraph if the Commissioner finds that there is valid reason for a delay, but in no case may the period be extended more than four months.




(B)
 If the benefit payments of an individual have been suspended for all months in any taxable year under the provisions of the first sentence of paragraph (3) of this subsection, no benefit payment shall be made to such individual for any such month in such taxable year after the expiration of the period of three years, three months, and fifteen days following the close of such taxable year unless within such period the individual, or some other person entitled to benefits under this subchapter on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income, files with the Commissioner of Social Security information showing that a benefit for such month is payable to such individual.






(2)
 If an individual fails to make a report required under paragraph (1) of this subsection, within the time prescribed by or in accordance with such paragraph, for any taxable year and any deduction is imposed under subsection (b) of this section by reason of his earnings for such year, he shall suffer additional deductions as follows:
(A)
 if such failure is the first one with respect to which an additional deduction is imposed under this paragraph, such additional deduction shall be equal to his benefit or benefits for the last month of such year for which he was entitled to a benefit under 
section 402 of this title
, except that if the deduction imposed under subsection (b) of this section by reason of his earnings for such year is less than the amount of his benefit (or benefits) for the last month of such year for which he was entitled to a benefit under 
section 402 of this title
, the additional deduction shall be equal to the amount of the deduction imposed under subsection (b) of this section but not less than $10;




(B)
 if such failure is the second one for which an additional deduction is imposed under this paragraph, such additional deduction shall be equal to two times his benefit or benefits for the last month of such year for which he was entitled to a benefit under 
section 402 of this title
;




(C)
 if such failure is the third or a subsequent one for which an additional deduction is imposed under this paragraph, such additional deduction shall be equal to three times his benefit or benefits for the last month of such year for which he was entitled to a benefit under 
section 402 of this title
;





except that the number of the additional deductions required by this paragraph with respect to a failure to report earnings for a taxable year shall not exceed the number of months in such year for which such individual received and accepted insurance benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 and for which deductions are imposed under subsection (b) of this section by reason of his earnings. In determining whether a failure to report earnings is the first or a subsequent failure for any individual, all taxable years ending prior to the imposition of the first additional deduction under this paragraph, other than the latest one of such years, shall be disregarded.




(3)
 If the Commissioner of Social Security determines, on the basis of information obtained by or submitted to the Commissioner, that it may reasonably be expected that an individual entitled to benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for any taxable year will suffer deductions imposed under subsection (b) of this section by reason of his earnings for such year, the Commissioner of Social Security may, before the close of such taxable year, suspend the total or less than the total payment for each month in such year (or for only such months as the Commissioner of Social Security may specify) of the benefits payable on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income; and such suspension shall remain in effect with respect to the benefits for any month until the Commissioner of Social Security has determined whether or not any deduction is imposed for such month under subsection (b) of this section. The Commissioner of Social Security is authorized, before the close of the taxable year of an individual entitled to benefits during such year, to request of such individual that he make, at such time or times as the Commissioner of Social Security may specify, a declaration of his estimated earnings for the taxable year and that he furnish to the Commissioner of Social Security such other information with respect to such earnings as the Commissioner of Social Security may specify. A failure by such individual to comply with any such request shall in itself constitute justification for a determination under this paragraph that it may reasonably be expected that the individual will suffer deductions imposed under subsection (b) of this section by reason of his earnings for such year. If, after the close of a taxable year of an individual entitled to benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for such year, the Commissioner of Social Security requests such individual to furnish a report of his earnings (as computed pursuant to paragraph (5) of subsection (f) of this section) for such taxable year or any other information with respect to such earnings which the Commissioner of Social Security may specify, and the individual fails to comply with such request, such failure shall in itself constitute justification for a determination that such individual’s benefits are subject to deductions under subsection (b) of this section for each month in such taxable year (or only for such months thereof as the Commissioner of Social Security may specify) by reason of his earnings for such year.




(4)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall develop and implement procedures in accordance with this subsection to avoid paying more than the correct amount of benefits to any individual under this subchapter as a result of such individual’s failure to file a correct report or estimate of earnings or wages. Such procedures may include identifying categories of individuals who are likely to be paid more than the correct amount of benefits and requesting that they estimate their earnings or wages more frequently than other persons subject to deductions under this section on account of earnings or wages.

 Attainment of retirement age
For the purposes of this section, an individual shall be considered as having attained retirement age (as defined in section 416(

) of this title) during the entire month in which he attains such age.




(k)
 Noncovered remunerative activity outside United States
An individual shall be considered to be engaged in noncovered remunerative activity outside the United States if he performs services outside the United States as an employee and such services do not constitute employment as defined in 
section 410 of this title
 and are not performed in the active military or naval service of the United States, or if he carries on a trade or business outside the United States (other than the performance of service as an employee) the net income or loss of which (1) is not includible in computing his net earnings from self-employment for a taxable year and (2) would not be excluded from net earnings from self-employment, if carried on in the United States, by any of the numbered paragraphs of 
section 411(a) of this title
. When used in the preceding sentence with respect to a trade or business (other than the performance of service as an employee), the term “United States” does not include the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa in the case of an alien who is not a resident of the United States (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa); and the term “trade or business” shall have the same meaning as when used in section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.




(l)
 Good cause for failure to make reports required
The failure of an individual to make any report required by subsection (g) or (h)(1)(A) of this section within the time prescribed therein shall not be regarded as such a failure if it is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that he had good cause for failing to make such report within such time. The determination of what constitutes good cause for purposes of this subsection shall be made in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security, except that in making any such determination, the Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation such individual may have (including any lack of facility with the English language).

 Overpayments and underpayments
(a)
 Procedure for adjustment or recovery
(1)
 Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security finds that more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made to any person under this subchapter, proper adjustment or recovery shall be made, under regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security, as follows:
(A)
 With respect to payment to a person of more than the correct amount, the Commissioner of Social Security shall decrease any payment under this subchapter to which such overpaid person is entitled, or shall require such overpaid person or his estate to refund the amount in excess of the correct amount, or shall decrease any payment under this subchapter payable to his estate or to any other person on the basis of the wages and self-employment income which were the basis of the payments to such overpaid person, or shall obtain recovery by means of reduction in tax refunds based on notice to the Secretary of the Treasury as permitted under 
section 3720A of title 31
, or shall apply any combination of the foregoing. A payment made under this subchapter on the basis of an erroneous report of death by the Department of Defense of an individual in the line of duty while he is a member of the uniformed services (as defined in 
section 410(m) of this title
) on active duty (as defined in section 410(
l
) of this title) shall not be considered an incorrect payment for any month prior to the month such Department notifies the Commissioner of Social Security that such individual is alive.




(B)
(i)
 Subject to clause (ii), with respect to payment to a person of less than the correct amount, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make payment of the balance of the amount due such underpaid person, or, if such person dies before payments are completed or before negotiating one or more checks representing correct payments, disposition of the amount due shall be made in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.




(ii)
 No payment shall be made under this subparagraph to any person during any period for which monthly insurance benefits of such person—
(I)
 are subject to nonpayment by reason of 
section 402(x)(1) of this title
, or




(II)
 in the case of a person whose monthly insurance benefits have terminated for a reason other than death, would be subject to nonpayment by reason of 
section 402(x)(1) of this title
 but for the termination of such benefits,





until 
section 402(x)(1) of this title
 no longer applies, or would no longer apply in the case of benefits that have terminated.




(iii)
 Nothing in clause (ii) shall be construed to limit the Commissioner’s authority to withhold amounts, make adjustments, or recover amounts due under this subchapter, subchapter VIII or subchapter XVI that would be deducted from a payment that would otherwise be payable to such person but for such clause.








(2)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when any payment of more than the correct amount is made to or on behalf of an individual who has died, and such payment—
(A)
 is made by direct deposit to a financial institution;




(B)
 is credited by the financial institution to a joint account of the deceased individual and another person; and




(C)
 such other person was entitled to a monthly benefit on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as the deceased individual for the month preceding the month in which the deceased individual died,





the amount of such payment in excess of the correct amount shall be treated as a payment of more than the correct amount to such other person. If any payment of more than the correct amount is made to a representative payee on behalf of an individual after the individual’s death, the representative payee shall be liable for the repayment of the overpayment, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish an overpayment control record under the social security account number of the representative payee.




(b)
 No recovery from persons without fault
In any case in which more than the correct amount of payment has been made, there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any person who is without fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience. In making for purposes of this subsection any determination of whether any individual is without fault, the Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation such individual may have (including any lack of facility with the English language).




(c)
 Nonliability of certifying and disbursing officers
No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any amount certified or paid by him to any person where the adjustment or recovery of such amount is waived under subsection (b) of this section, or where adjustment under subsection (a) of this section is not completed prior to the death of all persons against whose benefits deductions are authorized.




(d)
 Payment to survivors or heirs when eligible person is deceased
If an individual dies before any payment due him under this subchapter is completed, payment of the amount due (including the amount of any unnegotiated checks) shall be made—
(1)
 to the person, if any, who is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be the surviving spouse of the deceased individual and who either (i) was living in the same household with the deceased at the time of his death or (ii) was, for the month in which the deceased individual died, entitled to a monthly benefit on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as was the deceased individual;




(2)
 if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), or if the person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the child or children, if any, of the deceased individual who were, for the month in which the deceased individual died, entitled to monthly benefits on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as was the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such child, in equal parts to each such child);




(3)
 if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1) or (2), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the parent or parents, if any, of the deceased individual who were, for the month in which the deceased individual died, entitled to monthly benefits on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as was the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such parent, in equal parts to each such parent);




(4)
 if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), or (3), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the person, if any, determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be the surviving spouse of the deceased individual;




(5)
 if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the person or persons, if any, determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be the child or children of the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such child, in equal parts to each such child);




(6)
 if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the parent or parents, if any, of the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such parent, in equal parts to each such parent); or




(7)
 if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the legal representative of the estate of the deceased individual, if any.

section 1320b–17 of this title

 Evidence, procedure, and certification for payments
(a)
 Rules and regulations; procedures
The Commissioner of Social Security shall have full power and authority to make rules and regulations and to establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out such provisions, and shall adopt reasonable and proper rules and regulations to regulate and provide for the nature and extent of the proofs and evidence and the method of taking and furnishing the same in order to establish the right to benefits hereunder.




(b)
 Administrative determination of entitlement to benefits; findings of fact; hearings; investigations; evidentiary hearings in reconsiderations of disability benefit terminations; subsequent applications
(1)
 The Commissioner of Social Security is directed to make findings of fact, and decisions as to the rights of any individual applying for a payment under this subchapter. Any such decision by the Commissioner of Social Security which involves a determination of disability and which is in whole or in part unfavorable to such individual shall contain a statement of the case, in understandable language, setting forth a discussion of the evidence, and stating the Commissioner’s determination and the reason or reasons upon which it is based. Upon request by any such individual or upon request by a wife, divorced wife, widow, surviving divorced wife, surviving divorced mother, surviving divorced father, husband, divorced husband, widower, surviving divorced husband, child, or parent who makes a showing in writing that his or her rights may be prejudiced by any decision the Commissioner of Social Security has rendered, the Commissioner shall give such applicant and such other individual reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to such decision, and, if a hearing is held, shall, on the basis of evidence adduced at the hearing, affirm, modify, or reverse the Commissioner’s findings of fact and such decision. Any such request with respect to such a decision must be filed within sixty days after notice of such decision is received by the individual making such request. The Commissioner of Social Security is further authorized, on the Commissioner’s own motion, to hold such hearings and to conduct such investigations and other proceedings as the Commissioner may deem necessary or proper for the administration of this subchapter. In the course of any hearing, investigation, or other proceeding, the Commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. Evidence may be received at any hearing before the Commissioner of Social Security even though inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure.




(2)
 In any case where—
(A)
 an individual is a recipient of disability insurance benefits, or of child’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefits based on disability,




(B)
 the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are payable is found to have ceased, not to have existed, or to no longer be disabling, and




(C)
 as a consequence of the finding described in subparagraph (B), such individual is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security not to be entitled to such benefits,





any reconsideration of the finding described in subparagraph (B), in connection with a reconsideration by the Commissioner of Social Security (before any hearing under paragraph (1) on the issue of such entitlement) of the Commissioner’s determination described in subparagraph (C), shall be made only after opportunity for an evidentiary hearing, with regard to the finding described in subparagraph (B), which is reasonably accessible to such individual. Any reconsideration of a finding described in subparagraph (B) may be made either by the State agency or the Commissioner of Social Security where the finding was originally made by the State agency, and shall be made by the Commissioner of Social Security where the finding was originally made by the Commissioner of Social Security. In the case of a reconsideration by a State agency of a finding described in subparagraph (B) which was originally made by such State agency, the evidentiary hearing shall be held by an adjudicatory unit of the State agency other than the unit that made the finding described in subparagraph (B). In the case of a reconsideration by the Commissioner of Social Security of a finding described in subparagraph (B) which was originally made by the Commissioner of Social Security, the evidentiary hearing shall be held by a person other than the person or persons who made the finding described in subparagraph (B).




(3)
(A)
 A failure to timely request review of an initial adverse determination with respect to an application for any benefit under this subchapter or an adverse determination on reconsideration of such an initial determination shall not serve as a basis for denial of a subsequent application for any benefit under this subchapter if the applicant demonstrates that the applicant, or any other individual referred to in paragraph (1), failed to so request such a review acting in good faith reliance upon incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information, relating to the consequences of reapplying for benefits in lieu of seeking review of an adverse determination, provided by any officer or employee of the Social Security Administration or any State agency acting under 
section 421 of this title
.




(B)
 In any notice of an adverse determination with respect to which a review may be requested under paragraph (1), the Commissioner of Social Security shall describe in clear and specific language the effect on possible entitlement to benefits under this subchapter of choosing to reapply in lieu of requesting review of the determination.

(B)
(i)
 In carrying out the Commissioner’s duties under subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (F), the Commissioner of Social Security shall take affirmative measures to assure that social security account numbers will, to the maximum extent practicable, be assigned to all members of appropriate groups or categories of individuals by assigning such numbers (or ascertaining that such numbers have already been assigned):
(I)
 to aliens at the time of their lawful admission to the United States either for permanent residence or under other authority of law permitting them to engage in employment in the United States and to other aliens at such time as their status is so changed as to make it lawful for them to engage in such employment;




(II)
 to any individual who is an applicant for or recipient of benefits under any program financed in whole or in part from Federal funds including any child on whose behalf such benefits are claimed by another person; and




(III)
 to any other individual when it appears that he could have been but was not assigned an account number under the provisions of subclauses (I) or (II) but only after such investigation as is necessary to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security, the identity of such individual, the fact that an account number has not already been assigned to such individual, and the fact that such individual is a citizen or a noncitizen who is not, because of his alien status, prohibited from engaging in employment;





and, in carrying out such duties, the Commissioner of Social Security is authorized to take affirmative measures to assure the issuance of social security numbers:

(iii)
 In carrying out the requirements of this subparagraph, the Commissioner of Social Security shall enter into such agreements as may be necessary with the Attorney General and other officials and with State and local welfare agencies and school authorities (including nonpublic school authorities).






(C)

 It is the policy of the United States that any State (or political subdivision thereof) may, in the administration of any tax, general public assistance, driver’s license, or motor vehicle registration law within its jurisdiction, utilize the social security account numbers issued by the Commissioner of Social Security for the purpose of establishing the identification of individuals affected by such law, and may require any individual who is or appears to be so affected to furnish to such State (or political subdivision thereof) or any agency thereof having administrative responsibility for the law involved, the social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) issued to him by the Commissioner of Social Security.




(ii)
 In the administration of any law involving the issuance of a birth certificate, each State shall require each parent to furnish to such State (or political subdivision thereof) or any agency thereof having administrative responsibility for the law involved, the social security account number (or numbers, if the parent has more than one such number) issued to the parent unless the State (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security) finds good cause for not requiring the furnishing of such number. The State shall make numbers furnished under this subclause available to the Commissioner of Social Security and the agency administering the State’s plan under part D of subchapter IV of this chapter in accordance with Federal or State law and regulation. Such numbers shall not be recorded on the birth certificate. A State shall not use any social security account number, obtained with respect to the issuance by the State of a birth certificate, for any purpose other than for the enforcement of child support orders in effect in the State, unless section 7(a) of the Privacy Act of 1974 does not prohibit the State from requiring the disclosure of such number, by reason of the State having adopted, before 
January 1, 1975
, a statute or regulation requiring such disclosure.

7 U.S.C. 2011
 et seq.], the Secretary of Agriculture may require each applicant retail store or wholesale food concern to furnish to the Secretary of Agriculture the social security account number of each individual who is an officer of the store or concern and, in the case of a privately owned applicant, furnish the social security account numbers of the owners of such applicant. No officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture shall have access to any such number for any purpose other than the establishment and maintenance of a list of the names and social security account numbers of such individuals for use in determining those applicants who have been previously sanctioned or convicted under section 12 or 15 of such Act (
7 U.S.C. 2021

 Judicial review
Any individual, after any final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security made after a hearing to which he was a party, irrespective of the amount in controversy, may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the Commissioner of Social Security may allow. Such action shall be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides, or has his principal place of business, or, if he does not reside or have his principal place of business within any such judicial district, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. As part of the Commissioner’s answer the Commissioner of Social Security shall file a certified copy of the transcript of the record including the evidence upon which the findings and decision complained of are based. The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security, with or without remanding the cause for a rehearing. The findings of the Commissioner of Social Security as to any fact, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and where a claim has been denied by the Commissioner of Social Security or a decision is rendered under subsection (b) of this section which is adverse to an individual who was a party to the hearing before the Commissioner of Social Security, because of failure of the claimant or such individual to submit proof in conformity with any regulation prescribed under subsection (a) of this section, the court shall review only the question of conformity with such regulations and the validity of such regulations. The court may, on motion of the Commissioner of Social Security made for good cause shown before the Commissioner files the Commissioner’s answer, remand the case to the Commissioner of Social Security for further action by the Commissioner of Social Security, and it may at any time order additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security, but only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding; and the Commissioner of Social Security shall, after the case is remanded, and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered, modify or affirm the Commissioner’s findings of fact or the Commissioner’s decision, or both, and shall file with the court any such additional and modified findings of fact and decision, and, in any case in which the Commissioner has not made a decision fully favorable to the individual, a transcript of the additional record and testimony upon which the Commissioner’s action in modifying or affirming was based. Such additional or modified findings of fact and decision shall be reviewable only to the extent provided for review of the original findings of fact and decision. The judgment of the court shall be final except that it shall be subject to review in the same manner as a judgment in other civil actions. Any action instituted in accordance with this subsection shall survive notwithstanding any change in the person occupying the office of Commissioner of Social Security or any vacancy in such office.




(h)
 Finality of Commissioner’s decision
The findings and decision of the Commissioner of Social Security after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing.

section 402 of this title
 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such an individual (except a survivor of such an individual where such individual did not have a current connection with the railroad industry, as defined in the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, at the time of his death), such certification shall be made to the Railroad Retirement Board which shall provide for such payment or payments to such person on behalf of the Managing Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974):

(3)
(A)
 In any case where payment under this subchapter is made to a person other than the individual entitled to such payment, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a system of accountability monitoring whereby such person shall report not less often than annually with respect to the use of such payments. The Commissioner of Social Security shall establish and implement statistically valid procedures for reviewing such reports in order to identify instances in which such persons are not properly using such payments.




(B)
 Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in any case where the other person to whom such payment is made is a State institution. In such cases, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a system of accountability monitoring for institutions in each State.




(C)
 Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in any case where the individual entitled to such payment is a resident of a Federal institution and the other person to whom such payment is made is the institution.




(D)

(4)
(A)
(i)
 Except as provided in the next sentence, a qualified organization may collect from an individual a monthly fee for expenses (including overhead) incurred by such organization in providing services performed as such individual’s representative payee pursuant to this subsection if such fee does not exceed the lesser of—
(I)
 10 percent of the monthly benefit involved, or




(II)
 $25.00 per month ($50.00 per month in any case in which the individual is described in paragraph (1)(B)).





A qualified organization may not collect a fee from an individual for any month with respect to which the Commissioner of Social Security or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the organization misused all or part of the individual’s benefit, and any amount so collected by the qualified organization for such month shall be treated as a misused part of the individual’s benefit for purposes of paragraphs (5) and (6). The Commissioner shall adjust annually (after 1995) each dollar amount set forth in subclause (II) under procedures providing for adjustments in the same manner and to the same extent as adjustments are provided for under the procedures used to adjust benefit amounts under 
section 415(i)(2)(A) of this title
, except that any amount so adjusted that is not a multiple of $1.00 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.00. Any agreement providing for a fee in excess of the amount permitted under this subparagraph shall be void and shall be treated as misuse by such organization of such individual’s benefits.




(ii)
 In the case of an individual who is no longer currently entitled to monthly insurance benefits under this subchapter but to whom all past-due benefits have not been paid, for purposes of clause (i), any amount of such past-due benefits payable in any month shall be treated as a monthly benefit referred to in clause (i)(I).

(i)
 regularly provides services as the representative payee, pursuant to this subsection or section 1007 or 1383(a)(2) of this title, concurrently to 5 or more individuals,
7
7
 So in original. Probably should be followed by “and”.




(ii)
 demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that such agency is not otherwise a creditor of any such individual.





The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe regulations under which the Commissioner of Social Security may grant an exception from clause (ii) for any individual on a case-by-case basis if such exception is in the best interests of such individual.




(C)
 Any qualified organization which knowingly charges or collects, directly or indirectly, any fee in excess of the maximum fee prescribed under subparagraph (A) or makes any agreement, directly or indirectly, to charge or collect any fee in excess of such maximum fee, shall be fined in accordance with title 18, or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.






(5)
 In cases where the negligent failure of the Commissioner of Social Security to investigate or monitor a representative payee results in misuse of benefits by the representative payee, the Commissioner of Social Security shall certify for payment to the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s alternative representative payee an amount equal to such misused benefits. In any case in which a representative payee that—
(A)
 is not an individual (regardless of whether it is a “qualified organization” within the meaning of paragraph (4)(B)); or




(B)
 is an individual who, for any month during a period when misuse occurs, serves 15 or more individuals who are beneficiaries under this subchapter, subchapter VIII of this chapter, subchapter XVI of this chapter, or any combination of such subchapters;





misuses all or part of an individual’s benefit paid to such representative payee, the Commissioner of Social Security shall certify for payment to the beneficiary or the beneficiary’s alternative representative payee an amount equal to the amount of such benefit so misused. The provisions of this paragraph are subject to the limitations of paragraph (7)(B). The Commissioner of Social Security shall make a good faith effort to obtain restitution from the terminated representative payee.




(6)
(A)
 In addition to such other reviews of representative payees as the Commissioner of Social Security may otherwise conduct, the Commissioner shall provide for the periodic onsite review of any person or agency located in the United States that receives the benefits payable under this subchapter (alone or in combination with benefits payable under subchapter VIII of this chapter or subchapter XVI of this chapter) to another individual pursuant to the appointment of such person or agency as a representative payee under this subsection, 
section 1007 of this title
, or 
section 1383(a)(2) of this title
 in any case in which—
(i)
 the representative payee is a person who serves in that capacity with respect to 15 or more such individuals;




(ii)
 the representative payee is a certified community-based nonprofit social service agency (as defined in paragraph (10) of this subsection or 
section 1383(a)(2)(I) of this title
); or




(iii)
 the representative payee is an agency (other than an agency described in clause (ii)) that serves in that capacity with respect to 50 or more such individuals.






(B)
 Within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Commissioner shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a report on the results of periodic onsite reviews conducted during the fiscal year pursuant to subparagraph (A) and of any other reviews of representative payees conducted during such fiscal year in connection with benefits under this subchapter. Each such report shall describe in detail all problems identified in such reviews and any corrective action taken or planned to be taken to correct such problems, and shall include—
(i)
 the number of such reviews;




(ii)
 the results of such reviews;




(iii)
 the number of cases in which the representative payee was changed and why;




(iv)
 the number of cases involving the exercise of expedited, targeted oversight of the representative payee by the Commissioner conducted upon receipt of an allegation of misuse of funds, failure to pay a vendor, or a similar irregularity;




(v)
 the number of cases discovered in which there was a misuse of funds;




(vi)
 how any such cases of misuse of funds were dealt with by the Commissioner;




(vii)
 the final disposition of such cases of misuse of funds, including any criminal penalties imposed; and




(viii)
 such other information as the Commissioner deems appropriate.








(7)
(A)
 If the Commissioner of Social Security or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a representative payee that is not a Federal, State, or local government agency has misused all or part of an individual’s benefit that was paid to such representative payee under this subsection, the representative payee shall be liable for the amount misused, and such amount (to the extent not repaid by the representative payee) shall be treated as an overpayment of benefits under this subchapter to the representative payee for all purposes of this chapter and related laws pertaining to the recovery of such overpayments. Subject to subparagraph (B), upon recovering all or any part of such amount, the Commissioner shall certify an amount equal to the recovered amount for payment to such individual or such individual’s alternative representative payee.




(B)
 The total of the amount certified for payment to such individual or such individual’s alternative representative payee under subparagraph (A) and the amount certified for payment under paragraph (5) may not exceed the total benefit amount misused by the representative payee with respect to such individual.






(8)
 For purposes of this subsection, the term “benefit based on disability” of an individual means a disability insurance benefit of such individual under 
section 423 of this title
 or a child’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit of such individual under 
section 402 of this title
 based on such individual’s disability.




(9)
 For purposes of this subsection, misuse of benefits by a representative payee occurs in any case in which the representative payee receives payment under this subchapter for the use and benefit of another person and converts such payment, or any part thereof, to a use other than for the use and benefit of such other person. The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe by regulation the meaning of the term “use and benefit” for purposes of this paragraph.




(10)
 For purposes of this subsection, the term “certified community-based nonprofit social service agency” means a community-based nonprofit social service agency which is in compliance with requirements, under regulations which shall be prescribed by the Commissioner, for annual certification to the Commissioner that it is bonded in accordance with requirements specified by the Commissioner and that it is licensed in each State in which it serves as a representative payee (if licensing is available in the State) in accordance with requirements specified by the Commissioner. Any such annual certification shall include a copy of any independent audit on the agency which may have been performed since the previous certification.

Any payment made after 
December 31, 1939
, under conditions set forth in subsection (j) of this section, any payment made before 
January 1, 1940
, to, or on behalf of, a legally incompetent individual, and any payment made after 
December 31, 1939
, to a legally incompetent individual without knowledge by the Commissioner of Social Security of incompetency prior to certification of payment, if otherwise valid under this subchapter, shall be a complete settlement and satisfaction of any claim, right, or interest in and to such payment.

 Regulations pertaining to frequency or due dates of payments and reports under voluntary agreements covering State and local employees; effective date
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no regulation and no modification of any regulation, promulgated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, after 
 Representation of claimants before Commissioner
(a)
 Recognition of representatives; fees for representation before Commissioner
(1)
 The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe rules and regulations governing the recognition of agents or other persons, other than attorneys as hereinafter provided, representing claimants before the Commissioner of Social Security, and may require of such agents or other persons, before being recognized as representatives of claimants that they shall show that they are of good character and in good repute, possessed of the necessary qualifications to enable them to render such claimants valuable service, and otherwise competent to advise and assist such claimants in the presentation of their cases. An attorney in good standing who is admitted to practice before the highest court of the State, Territory, District, or insular possession of his residence or before the Supreme Court of the United States or the inferior Federal courts, shall be entitled to represent claimants before the Commissioner of Social Security. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Commissioner, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, (A) may refuse to recognize as a representative, and may disqualify a representative already recognized, any attorney who has been disbarred or suspended from any court or bar to which he or she was previously admitted to practice or who has been disqualified from participating in or appearing before any Federal program or agency, and (B) may refuse to recognize, and may disqualify, as a non-attorney representative any attorney who has been disbarred or suspended from any court or bar to which he or she was previously admitted to practice. A representative who has been disqualified or suspended pursuant to this section from appearing before the Social Security Administration as a result of collecting or receiving a fee in excess of the amount authorized shall be barred from appearing before the Social Security Administration as a representative until full restitution is made to the claimant and, thereafter, may be considered for reinstatement only under such rules as the Commissioner may prescribe. The Commissioner of Social Security may, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend or prohibit from further practice before the Commissioner any such person, agent, or attorney who refuses to comply with the Commissioner’s rules and regulations or who violates any provision of this section for which a penalty is prescribed. The Commissioner of Social Security may, by rule and regulation, prescribe the maximum fees which may be charged for services performed in connection with any claim before the Commissioner of Social Security under this subchapter, and any agreement in violation of such rules and regulations shall be void. Except as provided in paragraph (2)(A), whenever the Commissioner of Social Security, in any claim before the Commissioner for benefits under this subchapter, makes a determination favorable to the claimant, the Commissioner shall, if the claimant was represented by an attorney in connection with such claim, fix (in accordance with the regulations prescribed pursuant to the preceding sentence) a reasonable fee to compensate such attorney for the services performed by him in connection with such claim.




(2)
(A)
 In the case of a claim of entitlement to past-due benefits under this subchapter, if—
(i)
 an agreement between the claimant and another person regarding any fee to be recovered by such person to compensate such person for services with respect to the claim is presented in writing to the Commissioner of Social Security prior to the time of the Commissioner’s determination regarding the claim,




(ii)
 the fee specified in the agreement does not exceed the lesser of—
(I)
 25 percent of the total amount of such past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under 
section 1320a–6(a) of this title
), or




(II)
 $4,000, and






(iii)
 the determination is favorable to the claimant,





then the Commissioner of Social Security shall approve that agreement at the time of the favorable determination, and (subject to paragraph (3)) the fee specified in the agreement shall be the maximum fee. The Commissioner of Social Security may from time to time increase the dollar amount under clause (ii)(II) to the extent that the rate of increase in such amount, as determined over the period since 
January 1, 1991
, does not at any time exceed the rate of increase in primary insurance amounts under 
section 415(i) of this title
 since such date. The Commissioner of Social Security shall publish any such increased amount in the Federal Register.




(B)
 For purposes of this subsection, the term “past-due benefits” excludes any benefits with respect to which payment has been continued pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) of 
section 423 of this title
.




(C)
 In any case involving—
(i)
 an agreement described in subparagraph (A) with any person relating to both a claim of entitlement to past-due benefits under this subchapter and a claim of entitlement to past-due benefits under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and




(ii)
 a favorable determination made by the Commissioner of Social Security with respect to both such claims,





the Commissioner of Social Security may approve such agreement only if the total fee or fees specified in such agreement does not exceed, in the aggregate, the dollar amount in effect under subparagraph (A)(ii)(II).




(D)
 In the case of a claim with respect to which the Commissioner of Social Security has approved an agreement pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Commissioner of Social Security shall provide the claimant and the person representing the claimant a written notice of—
(i)
 the dollar amount of the past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under 
section 1320a–6(a) of this title
) and the dollar amount of the past-due benefits payable to the claimant,




(ii)
 the dollar amount of the maximum fee which may be charged or recovered as determined under this paragraph, and




(iii)
 a description of the procedures for review under paragraph (3).








(3)
(A)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall provide by regulation for review of the amount which would otherwise be the maximum fee as determined under paragraph (2) if, within 15 days after receipt of the notice provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(D)—
(i)
 the claimant, or the administrative law judge or other adjudicator who made the favorable determination, submits a written request to the Commissioner of Social Security to reduce the maximum fee, or




(ii)
 the person representing the claimant submits a written request to the Commissioner of Social Security to increase the maximum fee.





Any such review shall be conducted after providing the claimant, the person representing the claimant, and the adjudicator with reasonable notice of such request and an opportunity to submit written information in favor of or in opposition to such request. The adjudicator may request the Commissioner of Social Security to reduce the maximum fee only on the basis of evidence of the failure of the person representing the claimant to represent adequately the claimant’s interest or on the basis of evidence that the fee is clearly excessive for services rendered.




(B)
(i)
 In the case of a request for review under subparagraph (A) by the claimant or by the person representing the claimant, such review shall be conducted by the administrative law judge who made the favorable determination or, if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such administrative law judge is unavailable or if the determination was not made by an administrative law judge, such review shall be conducted by another person designated by the Commissioner of Social Security for such purpose.




(ii)
 In the case of a request by the adjudicator for review under subparagraph (A), the review shall be conducted by the Commissioner of Social Security or by an administrative law judge or other person (other than such adjudicator) who is designated by the Commissioner of Social Security.






(C)
 Upon completion of the review, the administrative law judge or other person conducting the review shall affirm or modify the amount which would otherwise be the maximum fee. Any such amount so affirmed or modified shall be considered the amount of the maximum fee which may be recovered under paragraph (2). The decision of the administrative law judge or other person conducting the review shall not be subject to further review.






(4)
 Subject to subsection (d) of this section, if the claimant is determined to be entitled to past-due benefits under this subchapter and the person representing the claimant is an attorney, the Commissioner of Social Security shall, notwithstanding 
section 405(i) of this title
, certify for payment out of such past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under 
section 1320a–6(a) of this title
) to such attorney an amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as does not exceed 25 percent of such past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under 
section 1320a–6(a) of this title
).




(5)
 Any person who shall, with intent to defraud, in any manner willfully and knowingly deceive, mislead, or threaten any claimant or prospective claimant or beneficiary under this subchapter by word, circular, letter or advertisement, or who shall knowingly charge or collect directly or indirectly any fee in excess of the maximum fee, or make any agreement directly or indirectly to charge or collect any fee in excess of the maximum fee, prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall for each offense be punished by a fine not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. The Commissioner of Social Security shall maintain in the electronic information retrieval system used by the Social Security Administration a current record, with respect to any claimant before the Commissioner of Social Security, of the identity of any person representing such claimant in accordance with this subsection.




(b)
 Fees for representation before court
(1)
(A)
 Whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this subchapter who was represented before the court by an attorney, the court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment, and the Commissioner of Social Security may, notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 405(i) of this title
, but subject to subsection (d) of this section, certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits. In case of any such judgment, no other fee may be payable or certified for payment for such representation except as provided in this paragraph.




(B)
 For purposes of this paragraph—
(i)
 the term “past-due benefits” excludes any benefits with respect to which payment has been continued pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) of 
section 423 of this title
, and




(ii)
 amounts of past-due benefits shall be determined before any applicable reduction under 
section 1320a–6(a) of this title
.








(2)
 Any attorney who charges, demands, receives, or collects for services rendered in connection with proceedings before a court to which paragraph (1) of this subsection is applicable any amount in excess of that allowed by the court thereunder shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.




(c)
 Notification of options for obtaining attorneys

For the purposes of determining average monthly wage and quarters of coverage the amount of self-employment income derived during any taxable year which begins before 1978 shall—
(1)
 in the case of a taxable year which is a calendar year, be credited equally to each quarter of such calendar year; and




(2)
 in the case of any other taxable year, be credited equally to the calendar quarter in which such taxable year ends and to each of the next three or fewer preceding quarters any part of which is in such taxable year.




(b)
 Taxable years after 1977
Except as provided in subsection (c), for the purposes of determining average indexed monthly earnings, average monthly wage, and quarters of coverage the amount of self-employment income derived during any taxable year which begins after 1977 shall—
(1)
 in the case of a taxable year which is a calendar year or which begins with or during a calendar year and ends with or during such year, be credited to such calendar year; and

 Quarter and quarter of coverage
(a)
 Definitions
For the purposes of this subchapter—
(1)
 The term “quarter”, and the term “calendar quarter”, mean a period of three calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31.




(2)
(A)
 The term “quarter of coverage” means—
(i)
 for calendar years before 1978, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), a quarter in which an individual has been paid $50 or more in wages (except wages for agricultural labor paid after 1954) or for which he has been credited (as determined under 
section 412 of this title
) with $100 or more of self-employment income; and




(ii)
 for calendar years after 1977, and subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B), each portion of the total of the wages paid and the self-employment income credited (pursuant to 
section 412 of this title
) to an individual in a calendar year which equals the amount required for a quarter of coverage in that calendar year (as determined under subsection (d) of this section), with such quarter of coverage being assigned to a specific calendar quarter in such calendar year only if necessary in the case of any individual who has attained age 62 or died or is under a disability and the requirements for insured status in subsection (a) or (b) of 
section 414 of this title
, the requirements for entitlement to a computation or recomputation of his primary insurance amount, or the requirements of paragraph (3) of 
section 416(i) of this title
 would not otherwise be met.






(B)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (A)—
(i)
 no quarter after the quarter in which an individual dies shall be a quarter of coverage, and no quarter any part of which is included in a period of disability (other than the initial quarter and the last quarter of such period) shall be a quarter of coverage;




(ii)
 if the wages paid to an individual in any calendar year equal $3,000 in the case of a calendar year before 1951, or $3,600 in the case of a calendar year after 1950 and before 1955, or $4,200 in the case of a calendar year after 1954 and before 1959, or $4,800 in the case of a calendar year after 1958 and before 1966, or $6,600 in the case of a calendar year after 1965 and before 1968, or $7,800 in the case of a calendar year after 1967 and before 1972, or $9,000 in the case of the calendar year 1972, or $10,800 in the case of the calendar year 1973, or $13,200 in the case of the calendar year 1974, or an amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under 
section 430 of this title
) in the case of any calendar year after 1974 and before 1978 with respect to which such contribution and benefit base is effective, each quarter of such year shall (subject to clauses (i) and (v)) be a quarter of coverage;




(iii)
 if an individual has self-employment income for a taxable year, and if the sum of such income and the wages paid to him during such year equals $3,600 in the case of a taxable year beginning after 1950 and ending before 1955, or $4,200 in the case of a taxable year ending after 1954 and before 1959, or $4,800 in the case of a taxable year ending after 1958 and before 1966, or $6,600 in the case of a taxable year ending after 1965 and before 1968, or $7,800 in the case of a taxable year ending after 1967 and before 1972, or $9,000 in the case of a taxable year beginning after 1971 and before 1973, or $10,800 in the case of a taxable year beginning after 1972 and before 1974, or $13,200 in the case of a taxable year beginning after 1973 and before 1975, or an amount equal to the contribution and benefit base (as determined under 
section 430 of this title
) which is effective for the calendar year in the case of any taxable year beginning in any calendar year after 1974 and before 1978, each quarter any part of which falls in such year shall (subject to clauses (i) and (v)) be a quarter of coverage;




(iv)
 if an individual is paid wages for agricultural labor in a calendar year after 1954 and before 1978, then, subject to clauses (i) and (v), (I) the last quarter of such year which can be but is not otherwise a quarter of coverage shall be a quarter of coverage if such wages equal or exceed $100 but are less than $200; (II) the last two quarters of such year which can be but are not otherwise quarters of coverage shall be quarters of coverage if such wages equal or exceed $200 but are less than $300; (III) the last three quarters of such year which can be but are not otherwise quarters of coverage shall be quarters of coverage if such wages equal or exceed $300 but are less than $400; and (IV) each quarter of such year which is not otherwise a quarter of coverage shall be a quarter of coverage if such wages are $400 or more;




(v)
 no quarter shall be counted as a quarter of coverage prior to the beginning of such quarter;




(vi)
 not more than one quarter of coverage may be credited to a calendar quarter; and




(vii)
 no more than four quarters of coverage may be credited to any calendar year after 1977.





If in the case of an individual who has attained age 62 or died or is under a disability and who has been paid wages for agricultural labor in a calendar year after 1954 and before 1978, the requirements for insured status in subsection (a) or (b) of 
section 414 of this title
, the requirements for entitlement to a computation or recomputation of his primary insurance amount, or the requirements of paragraph (3) of 
section 416(i) of this title
 are not met after assignment of quarters of coverage to quarters in such year as provided in clause (iv) of the preceding sentence, but would be met if such quarters of coverage were assigned to different quarters in such year, then such quarters of coverage shall instead be assigned, for purposes only of determining compliance with such requirements, to such different quarters. If, in the case of an individual who did not die prior to 
January 1, 1955
, and who attained age 62 (if a woman) or age 65 (if a man) or died before 
July 1, 1957
, the requirements for insured status in 
section 414(a)(3) of this title
 are not met because of his having too few quarters of coverage but would be met if his quarters of coverage in the first calendar year in which he had any covered employment had been determined on the basis of the period during which wages were earned rather than on the basis of the period during which wages were paid (any such wages paid that are reallocated on an earned basis shall not be used in determining quarters of coverage for subsequent calendar years), then upon application filed by the individual or his survivors and satisfactory proof of his record of wages earned being furnished by such individual or his survivors, the quarters of coverage in such calendar year may be determined on the basis of the periods during which wages were earned.






(b)
 Crediting of wages paid in 1937
With respect to wages paid to an individual in the six-month periods commencing either 
January 1, 1937
, or 
July 1, 1937
; (A) if wages of not less than $100 were paid in any such period, one-half of the total amount thereof shall be deemed to have been paid in each of the calendar quarters in such period; and (B) if wages of less than $100 were paid in any such period, the total amount thereof shall be deemed to have been paid in the latter quarter of such period, except that if in any such period, the individual attained age sixty-five, all of the wages paid in such period shall be deemed to have been paid before such age was attained.




(c)
 Alternative method for determining quarters of coverage with respect to wages in period from 1937 to 1950
For purposes of sections 414(a) and 415(d) of this title, an individual shall be deemed to have one quarter of coverage for each $400 of his total wages prior to 1951 (as defined in 
section 415(d)(1)(C) of this title
), except where such individual is not a fully insured individual on the basis of the number of quarters of coverage so derived plus the number of quarters of coverage derived from the wages and self-employment income credited to such individual for periods after 1950.




(d)
 Amount required for a quarter of coverage
(1)
 The amount of wages and self-employment income which an individual must have in order to be credited with a quarter of coverage in any year under subsection (a)(2)(A)(ii) of this section shall be $250 in the calendar year 1978 and the amount determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection for years after 1978.




(2)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall, on or before November 1 of 1978 and of every year thereafter, determine and publish in the Federal Register the amount of wages and self-employment income which an individual must have in order to be credited with a quarter of coverage in the succeeding calendar year. The amount required for a quarter of coverage shall be the larger of—
(A)
 the amount in effect in the calendar year in which the determination under this subsection is made, or




(B)
 the product of the amount prescribed in paragraph (1) which is required for a quarter of coverage in 1978 and the ratio of the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
) for the calendar year before the year in which the determination under this paragraph is made to the national average wage index (as so defined) for 1976,





with such product, if not a multiple of $10, being rounded to the next higher multiple of $10 where such amount is a multiple of $5 but not of $10 and to the nearest multiple of $10 in any other case.




 Insured status for purposes of old-age and survivors insurance benefits
(a)
 “Fully insured individual” defined
The term “fully insured individual” means any individual who had not less than—
(1)
 one quarter of coverage (whenever acquired) for each calendar year elapsing after 1950 (or, if later, the year in which he attained age 21) and before the year in which he died or (if earlier) the year in which he attained age 62, except that in no case shall an individual be a fully insured individual unless he has at least 6 quarters of coverage; or




(2)
 40 quarters of coverage; or




(3)
 in the case of an individual who died before 1951, 6 quarters of coverage;





not counting as an elapsed year for purposes of paragraph (1) any year any part of which was included in a period of disability (as defined in

), and who satisfies the criterion specified in subsection (c) of this section.


(b)
 “Currently insured individual” defined
The term “currently insured individual” means any individual who had not less than six quarters of coverage during the thirteen-quarter period ending with (1) the quarter in which he died, (2) the quarter in which he became entitled to old-age insurance benefits, (3) the quarter in which he became entitled to primary insurance benefits under this subchapter as in effect prior to 
August 28, 1950
, or (4) in the case of any individual entitled to disability insurance benefits, the quarter in which he most recently became entitled to disability insurance benefits, not counting as part of such thirteen-quarter period any quarter any part of which was included in a period of disability unless such quarter was a quarter of coverage, and who satisfies the criterion specified in subsection (c) of this section.




(c)
 Criterion described
For purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the criterion specified in this subsection is that the individual, if not a United States citizen or national—
(1)
 has been assigned a social security account number that was, at the time of assignment, or at any later time, consistent with the requirements of subclause (I) or (III) of 
section 405(c)(2)(B)(i) of this title

 Computation of primary insurance amount
(a)
 Primary insurance amount
(1)
(A)
 The primary insurance amount of an individual shall (except as otherwise provided in this section) be equal to the sum of—
(i)
 90 percent of the individual’s average indexed monthly earnings (determined under subsection (b) of this section) to the extent that such earnings do not exceed the amount established for purposes of this clause by subparagraph (B),




(ii)
 32 percent of the individual’s average indexed monthly earnings to the extent that such earnings exceed the amount established for purposes of clause (i) but do not exceed the amount established for purposes of this clause by subparagraph (B), and




(iii)
 15 percent of the individual’s average indexed monthly earnings to the extent that such earnings exceed the amount established for purposes of clause (ii),





rounded, if not a multiple of $0.10, to the next lower multiple of $0.10, and thereafter increased as provided in subsection (i) of this section.




(B)
(i)
 For individuals who initially become eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who die (before becoming eligible for such benefits), in the calendar year 1979, the amount established for purposes of clause (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall be $180 and $1,085, respectively.




(ii)
 For individuals who initially become eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who die (before becoming eligible for such benefits), in any calendar year after 1979, each of the amounts so established shall equal the product of the corresponding amount established with respect to the calendar year 1979 under clause (i) of this subparagraph and the quotient obtained by dividing—
(I)
 the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
) for the second calendar year preceding the calendar year for which the determination is made, by




(II)
 the national average wage index (as so defined) for 1977.






(iii)
 Each amount established under clause (ii) for any calendar year shall be rounded to the nearest $1, except that any amount so established which is a multiple of $0.50 but not of $1 shall be rounded to the next higher $1.






(C)
(i)
 No primary insurance amount computed under subparagraph (A) may be less than an amount equal to $11.50 multiplied by the individual’s years of coverage in excess of 10, or the increased amount determined for purposes of this clause under subsection (i) of this section.




(ii)
 For purposes of clause (i), the term “years of coverage” with respect to any individual means the number (not exceeding 30) equal to the sum of (I) the number (not exceeding 14 and disregarding any fraction) determined by dividing (a) the total of the wages credited to such individual (including wages deemed to be paid prior to 1951 to such individual under 
section 417 of this title
, compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 228a
 et seq.] prior to 1951 which is creditable to such individual pursuant to this subchapter, and wages deemed to be paid prior to 1951 to such individual under 
section 431 of this title
) for years after 1936 and before 1951 by (b) $900, plus (II) the number equal to the number of years after 1950 each of which is a computation base year (within the meaning of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) of this section) and in each of which he is credited with wages (including wages deemed to be paid to such individual under 
section 417 of this title
, compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 or 1974 [
45 U.S.C. 228a
 et seq., 231 et seq.] which is creditable to such individual pursuant to this subchapter, and wages deemed to be paid to such individual under 
section 429 of this title
) and self-employment income of not less than 25 percent (in the case of a year after 1950 and before 1978) of the maximum amount which (pursuant to subsection (e) of this section) may be counted for such year, or 25 percent (in the case of a year after 1977 and before 1991) or 15 percent (in the case of a year after 1990) of the maximum amount which (pursuant to subsection (e) of this section) could be counted for such year if 
section 430 of this title
 as in effect immediately prior to 
December 20, 1977
, had remained in effect without change (except that, for purposes of subsection (b) of such 
section 430 of this title
 as so in effect, the reference to the contribution and benefit base in paragraph (1) of such subsection (b) shall be deemed a reference to an amount equal to $45,000, each reference in paragraph (2) of such subsection (b) to the average of the wages of all employees as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury shall be deemed a reference to the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
), the reference to a preceding calendar year in paragraph (2)(A) of such subsection (b) shall be deemed a reference to the calendar year before the calendar year in which the determination under subsection (a) of such 
section 430 of this title
 is made, and the reference to a calendar year in paragraph (2)(B) of such subsection (b) shall be deemed a reference to 1992).






(D)
 In each calendar year the Commissioner of Social Security shall publish in the Federal Register, on or before November 1, the formula for computing benefits under this paragraph and for adjusting wages and self-employment income under subsection (b)(3) of this section in the case of an individual who becomes eligible for an old-age insurance benefit, or (if earlier) becomes eligible for a disability insurance benefit or dies, in the following year, and the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
) on which that formula is based.






(2)
(A)
 A year shall not be counted as the year of an individual’s death or eligibility for purposes of this subsection or subsection (i) of this section in any case where such individual was entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any of the 12 months immediately preceding the month of such death or eligibility (but there shall be counted instead the year of the individual’s eligibility for the disability insurance benefit or benefits to which he was entitled during such 12 months).




(B)
 In the case of an individual who was entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any of the 12 months before the month in which he became entitled to an old-age insurance benefit, became reentitled to a disability insurance benefit, or died, the primary insurance amount for determining any benefit attributable to that entitlement, reentitlement, or death is the greater of—
(i)
 the primary insurance amount upon which such disability insurance benefit was based, increased by the amount of each general benefit increase (as defined in subsection (i)(3) of this section), and each increase provided under subsection (i)(2) of this section, that would have applied to such primary insurance amount had the individual remained entitled to such disability insurance benefit until the month in which he became so entitled or reentitled or died, or




(ii)
 the amount computed under paragraph (1)(C).






(C)
 In the case of an individual who was entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any month, and with respect to whom a primary insurance amount is required to be computed at any time after the close of the period of the individual’s disability (whether because of such individual’s subsequent entitlement to old-age insurance benefits or to a disability insurance benefit based upon a subsequent period of disability, or because of such individual’s death), the primary insurance amount so computed may in no case be less than the primary insurance amount with respect to which such former disability insurance benefit was most recently determined.






(3)
(A)
 Paragraph (1) applies only to an individual who was not eligible for an old-age insurance benefit prior to January 1979 and who in that or any succeeding month—
(i)
 becomes eligible for such a benefit,




(ii)
 becomes eligible for a disability insurance benefit, or




(iii)
 dies,





and (except for subparagraph (C)(i) thereof) it applies to every such individual except to the extent otherwise provided by paragraph (4).




(B)
 For purposes of this subchapter, an individual is deemed to be eligible—
(i)
 for old-age insurance benefits, for months beginning with the month in which he attains age 62, or




(ii)
 for disability insurance benefits, for months beginning with the month in which his period of disability began as provided under 
section 416(i)(2)(C) of this title
,





except as provided in paragraph (2)(A) in cases where fewer than 12 months have elapsed since the termination of a prior period of disability.






(4)
 Paragraph (1) (except for subparagraph (C)(i) thereof) does not apply to the computation or recomputation of a primary insurance amount for—
(A)
 an individual who was eligible for a disability insurance benefit for a month prior to January 1979 unless, prior to the month in which occurs the event described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (3)(A), there occurs a period of at least 12 consecutive months for which he was not entitled to a disability insurance benefit, or




(B)
 an individual who had wages or self-employment income credited for one or more years prior to 1979, and who was not eligible for an old-age or disability insurance benefit, and did not die, prior to January 1979, if in the year for which the computation or recomputation would be made the individual’s primary insurance amount would be greater if computed or recomputed—
(i)
 under this subsection as in effect in December 1978, for purposes of old-age insurance benefits in the case of an individual who becomes eligible for such benefits prior to 1984, or




(ii)
 as provided by subsection (d) of this section, in the case of an individual to whom such section applies.







In determining whether an individual’s primary insurance amount would be greater if computed or recomputed as provided in subparagraph (B), (I) the table of benefits in effect in December 1978, as modified by paragraph (6), shall be applied without regard to any increases in that table which may become effective (in accordance with subsection (i)(4) of this section) for years after 1978 (subject to clause (iii) of subsection (i)(2)(A) of this section) and (II) such individual’s average monthly wage shall be computed as provided by subsection (b)(4) of this section.




(5)
(A)
 Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D) and (E), for purposes of computing the primary insurance amount (after December 1978) of an individual to whom paragraph (1) does not apply (other than an individual described in paragraph (4)(B)), this section as in effect in December 1978 shall remain in effect, except that, effective for January 1979, the dollar amount specified in paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be increased to $11.50.




(B)
(i)
 Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the primary insurance amount of any individual described in subparagraph (C) shall be, in lieu of the primary insurance amount as computed pursuant to any of the provisions referred to in subparagraph (D), the primary insurance amount computed under subsection (a) of this section as in effect in December 1978, without regard to subsections (b)(4) and (c) of this section as so in effect.




(ii)
 The computation of a primary insurance amount under this subparagraph shall be subject to section 104(j)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (relating to the number of elapsed years under subsection (b) of this section).




(iii)
 In computing a primary insurance amount under this subparagraph, the dollar amount specified in paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section (as in effect in December 1978) shall be increased to $11.50.




(iv)
 In the case of an individual to whom subsection (d) of this section applies, the primary insurance amount of such individual shall be the greater of—
(I)
 the primary insurance amount computed under the preceding clauses of this subparagraph, or




(II)
 the primary insurance amount computed under subsection (d) of this section.








(C)
 An individual is described in this subparagraph if—
(i)
 paragraph (1) does not apply to such individual by reason of such individual’s eligibility for an old-age or disability insurance benefit, or the individual’s death, prior to 1979, and




(ii)
 such individual’s primary insurance amount computed under this section as in effect immediately before 
November 5, 1990
, would have been computed under the provisions described in subparagraph (D).






(D)
 The provisions described in this subparagraph are—
(i)
 the provisions of this subsection as in effect prior to 
July 30, 1965
, if such provisions would preclude the use of wages prior to 1951 in the computation of the primary insurance amount,




(ii)
 the provisions of 
section 409 of this title
 as in effect prior to 
August 28, 1950
, and




(iii)
 the provisions of subsection (d) of this section as in effect prior to 
December 20, 1977
.






(E)
 For purposes of this paragraph, the table for determining primary insurance amounts and maximum family benefits contained in this section in December 1978 shall be revised as provided by subsection (i) of this section for each year after 1978.






(6)
(A)
 In applying the table of benefits in effect in December 1978 under this section for purposes of the last sentence of paragraph (4), such table, revised as provided by subsection (i) of this section, as applicable, shall be extended for average monthly wages of less than $76.00 and primary insurance benefits (as determined under subsection (d) of this section) of less than $16.20.




(B)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine and promulgate in regulations the methodology for extending the table under subparagraph (A).






(7)
(A)
 In the case of an individual whose primary insurance amount would be computed under paragraph (1) of this subsection, who—
(i)
 attains age 62 after 1985 (except where he or she became entitled to a disability insurance benefit before 1986 and remained so entitled in any of the 12 months immediately preceding his or her attainment of age 62), or




(ii)
 would attain age 62 after 1985 and becomes eligible for a disability insurance benefit after 1985,





and who first becomes eligible after 1985 for a monthly periodic payment (including a payment determined under subparagraph (C), but excluding (I) a payment under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 or 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 231
 et seq., 228a et seq.], (II) a payment by a social security system of a foreign country based on an agreement concluded between the United States and such foreign country pursuant to 
section 433 of this title
, and (III) a payment based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in 
section 410(m) of this title
)) which is based in whole or in part upon his or her earnings for service which did not constitute “employment” as defined in 
section 410 of this title
 for purposes of this subchapter (hereafter in this paragraph and in subsection (d)(3) of this section referred to as “noncovered service”), the primary insurance amount of that individual during his or her concurrent entitlement to such monthly periodic payment and to old-age or disability insurance benefits shall be computed or recomputed under subparagraph (B).




(B)
(i)
 If paragraph (1) of this subsection would apply to such an individual (except for subparagraph (A) of this paragraph), there shall first be computed an amount equal to the individual’s primary insurance amount under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that for purposes of such computation the percentage of the individual’s average indexed monthly earnings established by subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (1) shall be the percent specified in clause (ii). There shall then be computed (without regard to this paragraph) a second amount, which shall be equal to the individual’s primary insurance amount under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that such second amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the portion of the monthly periodic payment which is attributable to noncovered service performed after 1956 (with such attribution being based on the proportionate number of years of such noncovered service) and to which the individual is entitled (or is deemed to be entitled) for the initial month of his or her concurrent entitlement to such monthly periodic payment and old-age or disability insurance benefits. The individual’s primary insurance amount shall be the larger of the two amounts computed under this subparagraph (before the application of subsection (i) of this section) and shall be deemed to be computed under paragraph (1) of this subsection for the purpose of applying other provisions of this subchapter.




(ii)
 For purposes of clause (i), the percent specified in this clause is—
(I)
 80.0 percent with respect to individuals who become eligible (as defined in paragraph (3)(B)) for old-age insurance benefits (or became eligible as so defined for disability insurance benefits before attaining age 62) in 1986;




(II)

section 433 of this title
 or an individual who on 
January 1, 1984
—
(i)
 is an employee performing service to which social security coverage is extended on that date solely by reason of the amendments made by section 101 of the Social Security Amendments of 1983; or

Clause (ii), once applicable with respect to any individual, shall continue to apply for purposes of determining such individual’s primary insurance amount for purposes of any subsequent eligibility for disability or old-age insurance benefits unless prior to the month in which such eligibility begins there occurs a period of at least 12 consecutive months for which he was not entitled to a disability or an old-age insurance benefit. If an individual described in clause (ii) is living with a child (of such individual or his or her spouse) under the age of 3 in any calendar year which is included in such individual’s computation base years, but which is not disregarded pursuant to clause (ii) or to subparagraph (B) (in determining such individual’s benefit computation years) by reason of the reduction in the number of such individual’s elapsed years under clause (ii), the number by which such elapsed years are reduced under this subparagraph pursuant to clause (ii) shall be increased by one (up to a combined total not exceeding 3) for each such calendar year; except that (I) no calendar year shall be disregarded by reason of this sentence (in determining such individual’s benefit computation years) unless the individual was living with such child substantially throughout the period in which the child was alive and under the age of 3 in such year and the individual had no earnings as described in

The number of an individual’s benefit computation years as determined under this subparagraph shall in no case be less than 2.




(B)
 For purposes of this subsection with respect to any individual—
(i)
 the term “benefit computation years” means those computation base years, equal in number to the number determined under subparagraph (A), for which the total of such individual’s wages and self-employment income, after adjustment under paragraph (3), is the largest;




(ii)
 the term “computation base years” means the calendar years after 1950 and before—

section 402(j)(1) of this title
 or otherwise) the first month of that entitlement; or




(II)
 in the case of an individual who has died (without having become entitled to old-age insurance benefits), the year succeeding the year of his death;





except that such term excludes any calendar year entirely included in a period of disability; and




(iii)
 the term “number of elapsed years” means (except as otherwise provided by section 104(j)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972) the number of calendar years after 1950 (or, if later, the year in which the individual attained age 21) and before the year in which the individual died, or, if it occurred earlier (but after 1960), the year in which he attained age 62; except that such term excludes any calendar year any part of which is included in a period of disability.








(3)
(A)
 Except as provided by subparagraph (B), the wages paid in and self-employment income credited to each of an individual’s computation base years for purposes of the selection therefrom of benefit computation years under paragraph (2) shall be deemed to be equal to the product of—
(i)
 the wages and self-employment income paid in or credited to such year (as determined without regard to this subparagraph), and




(ii)
 the quotient obtained by dividing—
(I)
 the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
) for the second calendar year preceding the earliest of the year of the individual’s death, eligibility for an old-age insurance benefit, or eligibility for a disability insurance benefit (except that the year in which the individual dies, or becomes eligible, shall not be considered as such year if the individual was entitled to disability insurance benefits for any month in the 12-month period immediately preceding such death or eligibility, but there shall be counted instead the year of the individual’s eligibility for the disability insurance benefit to which he was entitled in such 12-month period), by




(II)
 the national average wage index (as so defined) for the computation base year for which the determination is made.








(B)
 Wages paid in or self-employment income credited to an individual’s computation base year which—
(i)
 occurs after the second calendar year specified in subparagraph (A)(ii)(I), or




(ii)
 is a year treated under subsection (f)(2)(C) of this section as though it were the last year of the period specified in paragraph (2)(B)(ii),





shall be available for use in determining an individual’s benefit computation years, but without applying subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.






(4)
 For purposes of determining the average monthly wage of an individual whose primary insurance amount is computed (after 1978) under subsection (a) or (d) of this section as in effect (except with respect to the table contained therein) in December 1978, by reason of subsection (a)(4)(B) of this section, this subsection as in effect in December 1978 shall remain in effect, except that paragraph (2)(C) (as then in effect) shall be deemed to provide that “computation base years” include only calendar years in the period after 1950 (or 1936, if applicable) and prior to the year in which occurred the first month for which the individual was eligible (as defined in subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section as in effect in January 1979) for an old-age or disability insurance benefit, or, if earlier, the year in which he died. Any calendar year all of which is included in a period of disability shall not be included as a computation base year for such purposes.

Subject to the amendments made by section 5117 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, this subsection as in effect in December 1978 shall remain in effect with respect to an individual to whom subsection (a)(1) of this section does not apply by reason of the individual’s eligibility for an old-age or disability insurance benefit, or the individual’s death, prior to 1979.




(d)
 Primary insurance amount under 1939 Act
(1)
 For purposes of column I of the table appearing in subsection (a) of this section, as that subsection was in effect in December 1977, an individual’s primary insurance benefit shall be computed as follows:

 The individual’s average monthly wage shall be determined as provided in subsection (b) of this section, as in effect in December 1977 (but without regard to paragraph (4) thereof and subject to section 104(j)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972), except that for purposes of paragraphs (2)(C) and (3) of that subsection (as so in effect) 1936 shall be used instead of 1950.




(B)
 For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (b)(2) of this section (as so in effect)—
(i)
 the total wages prior to 1951 (as defined in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph) of an individual—
(I)
 shall, in the case of an individual who attained age 21 prior to 1950, be divided by the number of years (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “divisor”) elapsing after the year in which the individual attained age 20, or 1936 if later, and prior to the earlier of the year of death or 1951, except that such divisor shall not include any calendar year entirely included in a period of disability, and in no case shall the divisor be less than one, and




(II)
 shall, in the case of an individual who died before 1950 and before attaining age 21, be divided by the number of years (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “divisor”) elapsing after the second year prior to the year of death, or 1936 if later, and prior to the year of death, and in no case shall the divisor be less than one; and






(ii)
 the total wages prior to 1951 (as defined in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph) of an individual who either attained age 21 after 1949 or died after 1949 before attaining age 21, shall be divided by the number of years (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “divisor”) elapsing after 1949 and prior to 1951.





The quotient so obtained shall be deemed to be the individual’s wages credited to each of the years which were used in computing the amount of the divisor, except that—


(iii)
 if the quotient exceeds $3,000, only $3,000 shall be deemed to be the individual’s wages for each of the years which were used in computing the amount of the divisor, and the remainder of the individual’s total wages prior to 1951 (I) if less than $3,000, shall be deemed credited to the computation base year (as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section as in effect in December 1977) immediately preceding the earliest year used in computing the amount of the divisor, or (II) if $3,000 or more, shall be deemed credited, in $3,000 increments, to the computation base year (as so defined) immediately preceding the earliest year used in computing the amount of the divisor and to each of the computation base years (as so defined) consecutively preceding that year, with any remainder less than $3,000 being credited to the computation base year (as so defined) immediately preceding the earliest year to which a full $3,000 increment was credited; and




(iv)
 no more than $42,000 may be taken into account, for purposes of this subparagraph, as total wages after 1936 and prior to 1951.






(C)

section 431 of this title
.




(D)
 The individual’s primary insurance benefit shall be 40 percent of the first $50 of his average monthly wage as computed under this subsection, plus 10 percent of the next $200 of his average monthly wage, increased by 1 percent for each increment year. The number of increment years is the number, not more than 14 nor less than 4, that is equal to the individual’s total wages prior to 1951 divided by $1,650 (disregarding any fraction).






(2)
 The provisions of this subsection shall be applicable only in the case of an individual—
(A)
 with respect to whom at least one of the quarters elapsing prior to 1951 is a quarter of coverage;

(C)
(i)
 who becomes entitled to benefits under section 402(a) or 423 of this title or who dies, or




(ii)
 whose primary insurance amount is required to be recomputed under paragraph (2), (6), or (7) of subsection (f) of this section or under 
section 431 of this title
.








(3)
 In the case of an individual whose primary insurance amount is not computed under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section by reason of paragraph (4)(B)(ii) of that subsection, who—
(A)
 attains age 62 after 1985 (except where he or she became entitled to a disability insurance benefit before 1986, and remained so entitled in any of the 12 months immediately preceding his or her attainment of age 62), or




(B)
 would attain age 62 after 1985 and becomes eligible for a disability insurance benefit after 1985,





and who first becomes eligible after 1985 for a monthly periodic payment (including a payment determined under subsection (a)(7)(C) of this section, but excluding (I) a payment under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 or 1937 [
45 U.S.C. 231
 et seq., 228a et seq.], (II) a payment by a social security system of a foreign country based on an agreement concluded between the United States and such foreign country pursuant to 
section 433 of this title
, and (III) a payment based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in 
section 410(m) of this title
)) which is based (in whole or in part) upon his or her earnings in noncovered service, the primary insurance amount of such individual during his or her concurrent entitlement to such monthly periodic payment and to old-age or disability insurance benefits shall be the primary insurance amount computed or recomputed under this subsection (without regard to this paragraph and before the application of subsection (i) of this section) reduced by an amount equal to the smaller of—


(i)

(ii)
 one-half of the portion of the monthly periodic payment (or payment determined under subsection (a)(7)(C) of this section) which is attributable to noncovered service performed after 1956 (with such attribution being based on the proportionate number of years of such noncovered service) and to which that individual is entitled (or is deemed to be entitled) for the initial month of such concurrent entitlement.





This paragraph shall not apply in the case of any individual to whom subsection (a)(7) of this section would not apply by reason of subparagraph (E) or the first sentence of subparagraph (D) thereof.

section 412 of this title
); and




(2)
 if an individual’s average indexed monthly earnings or, in the case of an individual whose primary insurance amount is computed under subsection (a) of this section as in effect prior to January 1979, average monthly wage, computed under subsection (b) of this section or for the purposes of subsection (d) of this section is not a multiple of $1, it shall be reduced to the next lower multiple of $1.

(G)
 the Consumer Price Index for a base quarter, a cost-of-living computation quarter, or any other calendar quarter shall be the arithmetical mean of such index for the 3 months in such quarter.






(2)
(A)
(i)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine each year beginning with 1975 (subject to the limitation in paragraph (1)(B)) whether the base quarter (as defined in paragraph (1)(A)(i)) in such year is a cost-of-living computation quarter.




(ii)
 If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the base quarter in any year is a cost-of-living computation quarter, the Commissioner shall, effective with the month of December of that year as provided in subparagraph (B), increase—
(I)
 the benefit amount to which individuals are entitled for that month under section 427 or 428 of this title,




(II)
 the primary insurance amount of each other individual on which benefit entitlement is based under this subchapter, and




(III)
 the amount of total monthly benefits based on any primary insurance amount which is permitted under 
section 403 of this title
 (and such total shall be increased, unless otherwise so increased under another provision of this subchapter, at the same time as such primary insurance amount) or, in the case of a primary insurance amount computed under subsection (a) of this section as in effect (without regard to the table contained therein) prior to January 1979, the amount to which the beneficiaries may be entitled under 
section 403 of this title
 as in effect in December 1978, except as provided by section 403(a)(7) and (8) of this title as in effect after December 1978.





The increase shall be derived by multiplying each of the amounts described in subdivisions (I), (II), and (III) (including each of those amounts as previously increased under this subparagraph) by the applicable increase percentage; and any amount so increased that is not a multiple of $0.10 shall be decreased to the next lower multiple of $0.10. Any increase under this subsection in a primary insurance amount determined under subparagraph (C)(i) of subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be applied after the initial determination of such primary insurance amount under that subparagraph (with the amount of such increase, in the case of an individual who becomes eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits or dies in a calendar year after 1979, being determined from the range of possible primary insurance amounts published by the Commissioner of Social Security under the last sentence of subparagraph (D)).




(iii)
 In the case of an individual who becomes eligible for an old-age or disability insurance benefit, or who dies prior to becoming so eligible, in a year in which there occurs an increase provided under clause (ii), the individual’s primary insurance amount (without regard to the time of entitlement to that benefit) shall be increased (unless otherwise so increased under another provision of this subchapter and, with respect to a primary insurance amount determined under subsection (a)(1)(C)(i)(I) of this section in the case of an individual to whom that subsection (as in effect in December 1981) applied, subject to the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(C)(i) of this section and clauses (iv) and (v) of this subparagraph (as then in effect)) by the amount of that increase and subsequent applicable increases, but only with respect to benefits payable for months after November of that year.






(B)
 The increase provided by subparagraph (A) with respect to a particular cost-of-living computation quarter shall apply in the case of monthly benefits under this subchapter for months after November of the calendar year in which occurred such cost-of-living computation quarter, and in the case of lump-sum death payments with respect to deaths occurring after November of such calendar year.




(C)
(i)
 Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security determines that a base quarter in a calendar year is also a cost-of-living computation quarter, the Commissioner shall notify the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance of such determination within 30 days after the close of such quarter, indicating the amount of the benefit increase to be provided, the Commissioner’s estimate of the extent to which the cost of such increase would be met by an increase in the contribution and benefit base under 
section 430 of this title
 and the estimated amount of the increase in such base, the actuarial estimates of the effect of such increase, and the actuarial assumptions and methodology used in preparing such estimates.




(ii)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine and promulgate the OASDI fund ratio for the current calendar year on or before November 1 of the current calendar year, based upon the most recent data then available. The Commissioner of Social Security shall include a statement of the fund ratio and the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
) and a statement of the effect such ratio and the level of such index may have upon benefit increases under this subsection in any notification made under clause (i) and any determination published under subparagraph (D).






(D)
 If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that a base quarter in a calendar year is also a cost-of-living computation quarter, the Commissioner shall publish in the Federal Register within 45 days after the close of such quarter a determination that a benefit increase is resultantly required and the percentage thereof. The Commissioner shall also publish in the Federal Register at that time (i) a revision of the range of the primary insurance amounts which are possible after the application of this subsection based on the dollar amount specified in subparagraph (C)(i) of subsection (a)(1) of this section (with such revised primary insurance amounts constituting the increased amounts determined for purposes of such subparagraph (C)(i) under this subsection), or specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section as in effect prior to 1979, and (ii) a revision of the range of maximum family benefits which correspond to such primary insurance amounts (with such maximum benefits being effective notwithstanding 
section 403(a) of this title
 except for paragraph (3)(B) thereof (or paragraph (2) thereof as in effect prior to 1979)). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such revision of maximum family benefits shall be subject to paragraph (6) of 
section 403(a) of this title
 (as added by section 101(a)(3) of the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980).






(3)
 As used in this subsection, the term “general benefit increase under this subchapter” means an increase (other than an increase under this subsection) in all primary insurance amounts on which monthly insurance benefits under this subchapter are based.




(4)
 This subsection as in effect in December 1978, and as amended by sections 111(a)(6), 111(b)(2), and 112 of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 and by section 9001 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, shall continue to apply to subsections (a) and (d) of this section, as then in effect and as amended by section 5117 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, for purposes of computing the primary insurance amount of an individual to whom subsection (a) of this section, as in effect after December 1978, does not apply (including an individual to whom subsection (a) of this section does not apply in any year by reason of paragraph (4)(B) of that subsection (but the application of this subsection in such cases shall be modified by the application of subdivision (I) in the last sentence of paragraph (4) of that subsection)), except that for this purpose, in applying paragraphs (2)(A)(ii), (2)(D)(iv), and (2)(D)(v) of this subsection as in effect in December 1978, the phrase “increased to the next higher multiple of $0.10” shall be deemed to read “decreased to the next lower multiple of $0.10”. For purposes of computing primary insurance amounts and maximum family benefits (other than primary insurance amounts and maximum family benefits for individuals to whom such paragraph (4)(B) applies), the Commissioner of Social Security shall revise the table of benefits contained in subsection (a) of this section, as in effect in December 1978, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection as then in effect, except that the requirement in such paragraph (2)(D) that the Commissioner of Social Security publish such revision of the table of benefits in the Federal Register shall not apply.




(5)
(A)
 If—
(i)
 with respect to any calendar year the “applicable increase percentage” was determined under clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(C) rather than under clause (i) of such paragraph, and the increase becoming effective under paragraph (2) in such year was accordingly determined on the basis of the wage increase percentage rather than the CPI increase percentage (or there was no such increase becoming effective under paragraph (2) in that year because there was no wage increase percentage greater than zero), and




(ii)
 for any subsequent calendar year in which an increase under paragraph (2) becomes effective the OASDI fund ratio is greater than 32.0 percent,





then each of the amounts described in subdivisions (I), (II), and (III) of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), as increased under paragraph (2) effective with the month of December in such subsequent calendar year, shall be further increased (effective with such month) by an additional percentage, which shall be determined under subparagraph (B) and shall apply as provided in subparagraph (C). Any amount so increased that is not a multiple of $0.10 shall be decreased to the next lower multiple of $0.10.




(B)
 The applicable additional percentage by which the amounts described in subdivisions (I), (II), and (III) of paragraph (2)(A)(ii) are to be further increased under subparagraph (A) in the subsequent calendar year involved shall be the amount derived by—
(i)
 subtracting (I) the compounded percentage benefit increases that were actually paid under paragraph (2) and this paragraph from (II) the compounded percentage benefit increases that would have been paid if all increases under paragraph (2) had been made on the basis of the CPI increase percentage,




(ii)
 dividing the difference by the sum of the compounded percentage in clause (i)(I) and 100 percent, and




(iii)
 multiplying such quotient by 100 so as to yield such applicable additional percentage (which shall be rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent),





with the compounded increases referred to in clause (i) being measured—


(iv)
 in the case of amounts described in subdivision (I) of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), over the period beginning with the calendar year in which monthly benefits described in such subdivision were first increased on the basis of the wage increase percentage and ending with the year before such subsequent calendar year, and




(v)
 in the case of amounts described in subdivisions (II) and (III) of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), over the period beginning with the calendar year in which the individual whose primary insurance amount is increased under such subdivision (II) became eligible (as defined in subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section) for the old-age or disability insurance benefit that is being increased under this subsection, or died before becoming so eligible, and ending with the year before such subsequent calendar year;





except that if the Commissioner of Social Security determines in any case that the application (in accordance with subparagraph (C)) of the additional percentage as computed under the preceding provisions of this subparagraph would cause the OASDI fund ratio to fall below 32.0 percent in the calendar year immediately following such subsequent year, the Commissioner shall reduce such applicable additional percentage to the extent necessary to ensure that the OASDI fund ratio will remain at or above 32.0 percent through the end of such following year.




(C)
 Any applicable additional percentage increase in an amount described in subdivision (I), (II), or (III) of paragraph (2)(A)(ii), made under this paragraph in any calendar year, shall thereafter be treated for all the purposes of this chapter as a part of the increase made in such amount under paragraph (2) for that year.






(a)
 in determining whether the base quarter ending on 
September 30, 1984
, is a cost-of-living computation quarter for the purposes of the cost-of-living increases under sections 215(i) and 1617 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 415(i)
, 1382f], the phrase ‘is 3 percent or more’ appearing in section 215(i)(1)(B) of such Act shall be deemed to read ‘is greater than zero’ (and the phrase ‘exceeds, by not less than 3 per centum, such Index’ appearing in section 215(i)(1)(B) of such Act as in effect in December 1978 shall be deemed to read ‘exceeds such Index’).


“(b)
 For purposes of section 215(i) of such Act, the provisions of subsection (a) shall not constitute a ‘general benefit increase’.”

 Determination of family status
(1)
(A)
(i)
 An applicant is the wife, husband, widow, or widower of a fully or currently insured individual for purposes of this subchapter if the courts of the State in which such insured individual is domiciled at the time such applicant files and application, or, if such insured individual is dead, the courts of the State in which he was domiciled at the time of death, or, if such insured individual is or was not so domiciled in any State, the courts of the District of Columbia, would find that such applicant and such insured individual were validly married at the time such applicant files such application or, if such insured individual is dead, at the time he died.




(ii)
 If such courts would not find that such applicant and such insured individual were validly married at such time, such applicant shall, nevertheless be deemed to be the wife, husband, widow, or widower, as the case may be, of such insured individual if such applicant would, under the laws applied by such courts in determining the devolution of intestate personal property, have the same status with respect to the taking of such property as a wife, husband, widow, or widower of such insured individual.






(B)
(i)
 In any case where under subparagraph (A) an applicant is not (and is not deemed to be) the wife, widow, husband, or widower of a fully or currently insured individual, or where under subsection (b), (c), (d), (f), or (g) of this section such applicant is not the wife, divorced wife, widow, surviving divorced wife, husband, divorced husband, widower, or surviving divorced husband of such individual, but it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that such applicant in good faith went through a marriage ceremony with such individual resulting in a purported marriage between them which, but for a legal impediment not known to the applicant at the time of such ceremony, would have been a valid marriage, then, for purposes of subparagraph (A) and subsections (b), (c), (d), (f), and (g) of this section, such purported marriage shall be deemed to be a valid marriage. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in the case of any person who would be deemed under the preceding sentence a wife, widow, husband, or widower of the insured individual, such marriage shall not be deemed to be a valid marriage unless the applicant and the insured individual were living in the same household at the time of the death of the insured individual or (if the insured individual is living) at the time the applicant files the application. A marriage that is deemed to be a valid marriage by reason of the preceding sentence shall continue to be deemed a valid marriage if the insured individual and the person entitled to benefits as the wife or husband of the insured individual are no longer living in the same household at the time of the death of such insured individual.




(ii)
 The provisions of clause (i) shall not apply if the Commissioner of Social Security determines, on the basis of information brought to the Commissioner’s attention, that such applicant entered into such purported marriage with such insured individual with knowledge that it would not be a valid marriage.




(iii)
 The entitlement to a monthly benefit under subsection (b) or (c) of 
section 402 of this title
, based on the wages and self-employment income of such insured individual, of a person who would not be deemed to be a wife or husband of such insured individual but for this subparagraph, shall end with the month before the month in which such person enters into a marriage, valid without regard to this subparagraph, with a person other than such insured individual.




(iv)
 For purposes of this subparagraph, a legal impediment to the validity of a purported marriage includes only an impediment (I) resulting from the lack of dissolution of a previous marriage or otherwise arising out of such previous marriage or its dissolution, or (II) resulting from a defect in the procedure followed in connection with such purported marriage.








(2)
(A)
 In determining whether an applicant is the child or parent of a fully or currently insured individual for purposes of this subchapter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply such law as would be applied in determining the devolution of intestate personal property by the courts of the State in which such insured individual is domiciled at the time such applicant files application, or, if such insured individual is dead, by the courts of the State in which he was domiciled at the time of his death, or, if such insured individual is or was not so domiciled in any State, by the courts of the District of Columbia. Applicants who according to such law would have the same status relative to taking intestate personal property as a child or parent shall be deemed such.




(B)
 If an applicant is a son or daughter of a fully or currently insured individual but is not (and is not deemed to be) the child of such insured individual under subparagraph (A), such applicant shall nevertheless be deemed to be the child of such insured individual if such insured individual and the mother or father, as the case may be, of such applicant went through a marriage ceremony resulting in a purported marriage between them which, but for a legal impediment described in the last sentence of paragraph (1)(B), would have been a valid marriage.






(3)
 An applicant who is the son or daughter of a fully or currently insured individual, but who is not (and is not deemed to be) the child of such insured individual under paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall nevertheless be deemed to be the child of such insured individual if:
(A)
 in the case of an insured individual entitled to old-age insurance benefits (who was not, in the month preceding such entitlement, entitled to disability insurance benefits)—
(i)
 such insured individual—
(I)
 has acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or her son or daughter,




(II)
 has been decreed by a court to be the mother or father of the applicant, or




(III)
 has been ordered by a court to contribute to the support of the applicant because the applicant is his or her son or daughter,





and such acknowledgment, court decree, or court order was made not less than one year before such insured individual became entitled to old-age insurance benefits or attained retirement age (as defined in subsection (
l
) of this section), whichever is earlier; or




(ii)
 such insured individual is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner of Social Security to be the mother or father of the applicant and was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant at the time such applicant’s application for benefits was filed;






(B)
 in the case of an insured individual entitled to disability insurance benefits, or who was entitled to such benefits in the month preceding the first month for which he or she was entitled to old-age insurance benefits—
(i)
 such insured individual—
(I)
 has acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or her son or daughter,




(II)
 has been decreed by a court to be the mother or father of the applicant, or




(III)
 has been ordered by a court to contribute to the support of the applicant because the applicant is his or her son or daughter,





and such acknowledgment, court decree, or court order was made before such insured individual’s most recent period of disability began; or




(ii)
 such insured individual is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner of Social Security to be the mother or father of the applicant and was living with or contributing to the support of that applicant at the time such applicant’s application for benefits was filed;






(C)
 in the case of a deceased individual—
(i)
 such insured individual—
(I)
 had acknowledged in writing that the applicant is his or her son or daughter,




(II)
 had been decreed by a court to be the mother or father of the applicant, or




(III)
 had been ordered by a court to contribute to the support of the applicant because the applicant was his or her son or daughter,





and such acknowledgment, court decree, or court order was made before the death of such insured individual, or




(ii)
 such insured individual is shown by evidence satisfactory to the Commissioner of Social Security to have been the mother or father of the applicant, and such insured individual was living with or contributing to the support of the applicant at the time such insured individual died.







For purposes of subparagraphs (A)(i) and (B)(i), an acknowledgement, court decree, or court order shall be deemed to have occurred on the first day of the month in which it actually occurred.




(i)
 Disability; period of disability
(1)
 Except for purposes of sections 402(d), 402(e), 402(f), 423, and 425 of this title, the term “disability” means (A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or (B) blindness; and the term “blindness” means central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered for purposes of this paragraph as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less. The provisions of paragraphs (2)(A), (2)(B), (3), (4), (5), and (6) of 
section 423(d) of this title
 shall be applied for purposes of determining whether an individual is under a disability within the meaning of the first sentence of this paragraph in the same manner as they are applied for purposes of paragraph (1) of such section. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as authorizing the Commissioner of Social Security or any other officer or employee of the United States to interfere in any way with the practice of medicine or with relationships between practitioners of medicine and their patients, or to exercise any supervision or control over the administration or operation of any hospital.




(2)
(A)
 The term “period of disability” means a continuous period (beginning and ending as hereinafter provided in this subsection) during which an individual was under a disability (as defined in paragraph (1)), but only if such period is of not less than five full calendar months’ duration or such individual was entitled to benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 for one or more months in such period.




(B)
 No period of disability shall begin as to any individual unless such individual files an application for a disability determination with respect to such period; and no such period shall begin as to any individual after such individual attains retirement age (as defined in subsection (
l
) of this section). In the case of a deceased individual, the requirement of an application under the preceding sentence may be satisfied by an application for a disability determination filed with respect to such individual within 3 months after the month in which he died.




(C)
 A period of disability shall begin—
(i)
 on the day the disability began, but only if the individual satisfies the requirements of paragraph (3) on such day; or




(ii)
 if such individual does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (3) on such day, then on the first day of the first quarter thereafter in which he satisfies such requirements.






(D)
 A period of disability shall end with the close of whichever of the following months is the earlier: (i) the month preceding the month in which the individual attains retirement age (as defined in subsection (
l
) of this section), or (ii) the month preceding (I) the termination month (as defined in 
section 423(a)(1) of this title
), or, if earlier (II) the first month for which no benefit is payable by reason of 
section 423(e) of this title
, where no benefit is payable for any of the succeeding months during the 36-month period referred to in such section. The provisions set forth in 
section 423(f) of this title
 with respect to determinations of whether entitlement to benefits under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII of this chapter based on the disability of any individual is terminated (on the basis of a finding that the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are provided has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling) shall apply in the same manner and to the same extent with respect to determinations of whether a period of disability has ended (on the basis of a finding that the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which the finding of disability was made has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling).




(E)
 Except as is otherwise provided in subparagraph (F), no application for a disability determination which is filed more than 12 months after the month prescribed by subparagraph (D) as the month in which the period of disability ends (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) and this subparagraph) shall be accepted as an application for purposes of this paragraph.




(F)
 An application for a disability determination which is filed more than 12 months after the month prescribed by subparagraph (D) as the month in which the period of disability ends (determined without regard to subparagraphs (B) and (E)) shall be accepted as an application for purposes of this paragraph if—
(i)
 in the case of an application filed by or on behalf of an individual with respect to a disability which ends after January 1968, such application is filed not more than 36 months after the month in which such disability ended, such individual is alive at the time the application is filed, and the Commissioner of Social Security finds in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner that the failure of such individual to file an application for a disability determination within the time specified in subparagraph (E) was attributable to a physical or mental condition of such individual which rendered him incapable of executing such an application, and




(ii)
 in the case of an application filed by or on behalf of an individual with respect to a period of disability which ends in or before January 1968—
(I)
 such application is filed not more than 12 months after January 1968,




(II)
 a previous application for a disability determination has been filed by or on behalf of such individual (1) in or before January 1968, and (2) not more than 36 months after the month in which his disability ended, and




(III)
 the Commissioner of Social Security finds in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, that the failure of such individual to file an application within the then specified time period was attributable to a physical or mental condition of such individual which rendered him incapable of executing such an application.







In making a determination under this subsection, with respect to the disability or period of disability of any individual whose application for a determination thereof is accepted solely by reason of the provisions of this subparagraph (F), the provisions of this subsection (other than the provisions of this subparagraph) shall be applied as such provisions are in effect at the time such determination is made.




(G)
 An application for a disability determination filed before the first day on which the applicant satisfies the requirements for a period of disability under this subsection shall be deemed a valid application (and shall be deemed to have been filed on such first day) only if the applicant satisfies the requirements for a period of disability before the Commissioner of Social Security makes a final decision on the application and no request under 
section 405(b) of this title
 for notice and opportunity for a hearing thereon is made or, if such a request is made, before a decision based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing is made (regardless of whether such decision becomes the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security).






(3)
 The requirements referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(C) of this subsection are satisfied by an individual with respect to any quarter only if—
(A)
 he would have been a fully insured individual (as defined in 
section 414 of this title
) had he attained age 62 and filed application for benefits under 
section 402(a) of this title
 on the first day of such quarter; and




(B)
(i)
 he had not less than 20 quarters of coverage during the 40-quarter period which ends with such quarter, or




(ii)
 if such quarter ends before he attains (or would attain) age 31, not less than one-half (and not less than 6) of the quarters during the period ending with such quarter and beginning after he attained the age of 21 were quarters of coverage, or (if the number of quarters in such period is less than 12) not less than 6 of the quarters in the 12-quarter period ending with such quarter were quarters of coverage, or




(iii)
 in the case of an individual (not otherwise insured under clause (i)) who, by reason of clause (ii), had a prior period of disability that began during a period before the quarter in which he or she attained age 31, not less than one-half of the quarters beginning after such individual attained age 21 and ending with such quarter are quarters of coverage, or (if the number of quarters in such period is less than 12) not less than 6 of the quarters in the 12-quarter period ending with such quarter are quarters of coverage;







except that the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of an individual who is blind (within the meaning of “blindness” as defined in paragraph (1)). For purposes of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, when the number of quarters in any period is an odd number, such number shall be reduced by one, and a quarter shall not be counted as part of any period if any part of such quarter was included in a prior period of disability unless such quarter was a quarter of coverage.




(j)
 Periods of limitation ending on nonwork days
Where this subchapter, any provision of another law of the United States (other than the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) relating to or changing the effect of this subchapter, or any regulation issued by the Commissioner of Social Security pursuant thereto provides for a period within which an act is required to be done which affects eligibility for or the amount of any benefit or payment under this subchapter or is necessary to establish or protect any rights under this subchapter, and such period ends on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, or on any other day all or part of which is declared to be a nonwork day for Federal employees by statute or Executive order, then such act shall be considered as done within such period if it is done on the first day thereafter which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday or any other day all or part of which is declared to be a nonwork day for Federal employees by statute or Executive order. For purposes of this subsection, the day on which a period ends shall include the day on which an extension of such period, as authorized by law or by the Commissioner of Social Security pursuant to law, ends. The provisions of this subsection shall not extend the period during which benefits under this subchapter may (pursuant to section 402(j)(1) or 423(b) of this title) be paid for months prior to the day application for such benefits is filed, or during which an application for benefits under this subchapter may (pursuant to section 402(j)(2) or 423(b) of this title) be accepted as such.




(k)
 Waiver of nine-month requirement for widow, stepchild, or widower in case of accidental death or in case of serviceman dying in line of duty, or in case of remarriage to same individual
The requirement in clause (E) of subsection (c)(1) of this section or clause (E) of subsection (g)(1) of this section that the surviving spouse of an individual have been married to such individual for a period of not less than nine months immediately prior to the day on which such individual died in order to qualify as such individual’s widow or widower, and the requirement in subsection (e) of this section that the stepchild of a deceased individual have been such stepchild for not less than nine months immediately preceding the day on which such individual died in order to qualify as such individual’s child, shall be deemed to be satisfied, where such individual dies within the applicable nine-month period, if—
(1)
 his death—
(A)
 is accidental, or




(B)
 occurs in line of duty while he is a member of a uniformed service serving on active duty (as defined in section 410(
l
)(2) of this title),





unless the Commissioner of Social Security determines that at the time of the marriage involved the individual could not have reasonably been expected to live for nine months, or




(2)
(A)
 the widow or widower of such individual had been previously married to such individual and subsequently divorced and such requirement would have been satisfied at the time of such divorce if such previous marriage had been terminated by the death of such individual at such time instead of by divorce; or




(B)
 the stepchild of such individual had been the stepchild of such individual during a previous marriage of such stepchild’s parent to such individual which ended in divorce and such requirement would have been satisfied at the time of such divorce if such previous marriage had been terminated by the death of such individual at such time instead of by divorce;







except that paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not apply if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that at the time of the marriage involved the individual could not have reasonably been expected to live for nine months. For purposes of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the death of an individual is accidental if he receives bodily injuries solely through violent, external, and accidental means and, as a direct result of the bodily injuries and independently of all other causes, loses his life not later than three months after the day on which he receives such bodily injuries.

(2)
 The term “early retirement age” means age 62 in the case of an old-age, wife’s, or husband’s insurance benefit, and age 60 in the case of a widow’s or widower’s insurance benefit.

(A)
 With respect to an individual who attains early retirement age in the 5-year period consisting of the calendar years 2000 through 2004, the age increase factor shall be equal to two-twelfths of the number of months in the period beginning with January 2000 and ending with December of the year in which the individual attains early retirement age.

42 U.S.C. 416(i)(3)
] with respect to any quarter, or who is not insured for disability insurance benefits as determined under section 223(c)(1) of such Act [

] with respect to any month in a quarter, such individual shall be deemed to have met such requirements with respect to such quarter or to be so insured with respect to such month of such quarter, as the case may be, if—
“(1)
 he had a total of not less than twenty quarters of coverage (as defined in section 213 of such Act [
42 U.S.C. 413
]) during the period ending with the close of such quarter, and

 Benefits for veterans
(a)
 Determination of benefits
(1)
 For purposes of determining entitlement to and the amount of any monthly benefit for any month after August 1950, or entitlement to and the amount of any lump-sum death payment in case of a death after such month, payable under this subchapter on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of any World War II veteran, and for purposes of 
section 416(i)(3) of this title
, such veteran shall be deemed to have been paid wages (in addition to the wages, if any, actually paid to him) of $160 in each month during any part of which he served in the active military or naval service of the United States during World War II. This subsection shall not be applicable in the case of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment if—
(A)
 a larger such benefit or payment, as the case may be, would be payable without its application; or




(B)
 a benefit (other than a benefit payable in a lump sum unless it is a commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments) which is based, in whole or in part, upon the active military or naval service of such veteran during World War II is determined by any agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States (other than the Department of Veterans Affairs) to be payable by it under any other law of the United States or under a system established by such agency or instrumentality.





The provisions of clause (B) of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment under this subchapter if its application would reduce by $0.50 or less the primary insurance amount (as computed under 
section 415 of this title
 prior to any recomputation thereof pursuant to 
section 415(f) of this title
) of the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit or payment is based. The provisions of clause (B) of this paragraph shall also not apply for purposes of 
section 416(i)(3) of this title
.




(2)
 Upon application for benefits or a lump-sum death payment on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of any World War II veteran, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make a decision without regard to clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the Commissioner has been notified by some other agency or instrumentality of the United States that, on the basis of the military or naval service of such veteran during World War II, a benefit described in clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection has been determined by such agency or instrumentality to be payable by it. If the Commissioner has not been so notified, the Commissioner of Social Security shall then ascertain whether some other agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States has decided that a benefit described in clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection is payable by it. If any such agency or instrumentality has decided, or thereafter decides, that such a benefit is payable by it, it shall so notify the Commissioner of Social Security, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall certify no further benefits for payment or shall recompute the amount of any further benefits payable, as may be required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.




(3)
 Any agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States which is authorized by any law of the United States to pay benefits, or has a system of benefits which are based, in whole or in part, on military or naval service during World War II shall, at the request of the Commissioner of Social Security, certify to the Commissioner, with respect to any veteran, such information as the Commissioner of Social Security deems necessary to carry out the Commissioner’s functions under paragraph (2) of this subsection.




(b)
 Determination of insurance status
(1)
 Subject to paragraph (3), any World War II veteran who died during the period of three years immediately following his separation from the active military or naval service of the United States shall be deemed to have died a fully insured individual whose primary insurance amount is the amount determined under 
section 415(c) of this title
 as in effect in December 1978. Notwithstanding 
section 415(d) of this title
 as in effect in December 1978, the primary insurance benefit (for purposes of 
section 415(c) of this title
 as in effect in December 1978) of such veteran shall be determined as provided in this subchapter as in effect prior to 
August 28, 1950
, except that the 1 per centum addition provided for in 
section 409(a)(4)(B) of this title
 as in effect prior to 
August 28, 1950
, shall be applicable only with respect to calendar years prior to 1951. This subsection shall not be applicable in the case of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment if—
(A)
 a larger such benefit or payment, as the case may be, would be payable without its application;




(B)
 any pension or compensation is determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be payable by him on the basis of the death of such veteran;




(C)
 the death of the veteran occurred while he was in the active military or naval service of the United States; or




(D)
 such veteran has been discharged or released from the active military or naval service of the United States subsequent to 
July 26, 1951
.






(2)
 Upon an application for benefits or a lump-sum death payment on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of any World War II veteran, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make a decision without regard to paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection unless the Commissioner has been notified by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs that pension or compensation is determined to be payable by that Secretary by reason of the death of such veteran. The Commissioner of Social Security shall thereupon report such decision to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. If the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in any such case has made an adjudication or thereafter makes an adjudication that any pension or compensation is payable under any law administered by it, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall notify the Commissioner of Social Security, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall certify no further benefits for payment, or shall recompute the amount of any further benefits payable, as may be required by paragraph (1) of this subsection. Any payments theretofore certified by the Commissioner of Social Security on the basis of paragraph (1) of this subsection to any individual, not exceeding the amount of any accrued pension or compensation payable to him by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall (notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 5301 of title 38
) be deemed to have been paid to him by that Secretary on account of such accrued pension or compensation. No such payment certified by the Commissioner of Social Security, and no payment certified by the Commissioner for any month prior to the first month for which any pension or compensation is paid by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall be deemed by reason of this subsection to have been an erroneous payment.




(3)
(A)
 The preceding provisions of this subsection shall apply for purposes of determining the entitlement to benefits under 
section 402 of this title
, based on the primary insurance amount of the deceased World War II veteran, of any surviving individual only if such surviving individual makes application for such benefits before the end of the 18-month period after November 1990.




(B)
 Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if any person is entitled to benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 based on the primary insurance amount of such veteran for the month preceding the month in which such application is made.






(c)
 Filing proof of support
In the case of any World War II veteran to whom subsection (a) of this section is applicable, proof of support required under 
section 402(h) of this title
 may be filed by a parent at any time prior to July 1951 or prior to the expiration of two years after the date of the death of such veteran, whichever is the later.

 For purposes of determining entitlement to and the amount of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment payable under this subchapter on the basis of wages and self-employment income of any veteran (as defined in paragraph (4) of this subsection), and for purposes of 
section 416(i)(3) of this title
, such veteran shall be deemed to have been paid wages (in addition to the wages, if any, actually paid to him) of $160 in each month during any part of which he served in the active military or naval service of the United States on or after 
July 25, 1947
, and prior to 
January 1, 1957
. This subsection shall not be applicable in the case of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment if—
(A)
 a larger such benefit or payment, as the case may be, would be payable without its application; or




(B)
 a benefit (other than a benefit payable in a lump sum unless it is a commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments) which is based, in whole or in part, upon the active military or naval service of such veteran on or after 
July 25, 1947
, and prior to 
January 1, 1957
, is determined by any agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States (other than the Department of Veterans Affairs) to be payable by it under any other law of the United States or under a system established by such agency or instrumentality.





The provisions of clause (B) of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of any monthly benefit or lump-sum death payment under this subchapter if its application would reduce by $0.50 or less the primary insurance amount (as computed under 
section 415 of this title
 prior to any recomputation thereof pursuant to subsection (f) of 
section 415 of this title
) of the individual on whose wages and self-employment income such benefit or payment is based. The provisions of clause (B) of this paragraph shall also not apply for purposes of 
section 416(i)(3) of this title
. In the case of monthly benefits under this subchapter for months after December 1956 (and any lump-sum death payment under this subchapter with respect to a death occurring after December 1956) based on the wages and self-employment income of a veteran who performed service (as a member of a uniformed service) to which the provisions of section 410(
l
)(1) of this title are applicable, wages which would, but for the provisions of clause (B) of this paragraph, be deemed under this subsection to have been paid to such veteran with respect to his active military or naval service performed after December 1950 shall be deemed to have been paid to him with respect to such service notwithstanding the provisions of such clause, but only if the benefits referred to in such clause which are based (in whole or in part) on such service are payable solely by the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Coast and Geodetic Survey, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps, or Public Health Service.




(2)
 Upon application for benefits or a lump-sum death payment on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of any veteran, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make a decision without regard to clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the Commissioner has been notified by some other agency or instrumentality of the United States that, on the basis of the military or naval service of such veteran on or after 
July 25, 1947
, and prior to 
January 1, 1957
, a benefit described in clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection has been determined by such agency or instrumentality to be payable by it. If the Commissioner has not been so notified, the Commissioner of Social Security shall then ascertain whether some other agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States has decided that a benefit described in clause (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection is payable by it. If any such agency or instrumentality has decided, or thereafter decides, that such a benefit is payable by it, it shall so notify the Commissioner of Social Security, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall certify no further benefits for payment or shall recompute the amount of any further benefits payable, as may be required by paragraph (1) of this subsection.




(3)
 Any agency or wholly owned instrumentality of the United States which is authorized by any law of the United States to pay benefits, or has a system of benefits which are based, in whole or in part, on military or naval service on or after 
July 25, 1947
, and prior to 
January 1, 1957
, shall, at the request of the Commissioner of Social Security, certify to the Commissioner, with respect to any veteran, such information as the Commissioner of Social Security deems necessary to carry out the Commissioner’s functions under paragraph (2) of this subsection.

(f)
 Right to annuity; waiver
(1)
 In any case where a World War II veteran (as defined in subsection (d)(2) of this section) or a veteran (as defined in subsection (e)(4) of this section) has died or shall hereafter die, and his or her surviving spouse or child is entitled under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 to an annuity in the computation of which his or her active military or naval service was included, clause (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section or clause (B) of subsection (e)(1) of this section shall not operate (solely by reason of such annuity) to make such subsection inapplicable in the case of any monthly benefit under 
section 402 of this title
 which is based on his or her wages and self-employment income; except that no such surviving spouse or child shall be entitled under 
section 402 of this title
 to any monthly benefit in the computation of which such service is included by reason of this subsection (A) unless such surviving spouse or child after December 1956 waives his or her right to receive such annuity, or (B) for any month prior to the first month with respect to which the Director of the Office of Personnel Management certifies to the Commissioner of Social Security that (by reason of such waiver) no further annuity will be paid to such surviving spouse or child under such subchapter III on the basis of such veteran’s military or civilian service. Any such waiver shall be irrevocable.

 Whenever a surviving spouse waives his or her right to receive such annuity such waiver shall constitute a waiver on his or her own behalf; a waiver by a legal guardian or guardians, or, in the absence of a legal guardian, the person (or persons) who has the child in his or her care, of the child’s right to receive such annuity shall constitute a waiver on behalf of such child. Such a waiver with respect to an annuity based on a veteran’s service shall be valid only if the surviving spouse and all children, or, if there is no surviving spouse, all the children, waive their rights to receive annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 based on such veteran’s military or civilian service.

(B)
 any amounts previously transferred from the general fund of the Treasury to such Trust Funds pursuant to the provisions of this subsection as in effect immediately before

.





Such actuarial present value shall be based on the relevant actuarial assumptions set forth in the report of the Board of Trustees of each such Trust Fund for 1983 under sections 401(c) and 1395i(b) of this title. Within thirty days after 
April 20, 1983

(2)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall revise the amount determined under paragraph (1) with respect to each such Trust Fund in 1985 and each fifth year thereafter, as determined appropriate by the Commissioner of Social Security from data which becomes available to the Commissioner after the date of the determination under paragraph (1) on the basis of the amount of benefits and administrative expenses actually paid from such Trust Fund under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII of this chapter and the relevant actuarial assumptions set forth in the report of the Board of Trustees of such Trust Fund for such year under section 401(c) or 1395i(b) of this title.

 Notwithstanding 
section 410(a) of this title
, for the purposes of this subchapter the term “employment” includes any service included under an agreement entered into under this section.




(b)
 Definitions
For the purposes of this section—
(1)
 The term “State” does not include the District of Columbia, Guam, or American Samoa.




(2)
 The term “political subdivision” includes an instrumentality of (A) a State, (B) one or more political subdivisions of a State, or (C) a State and one or more of its political subdivisions.




(3)
 The term “employee” includes an officer of a State or political subdivision.




(4)
 The term “retirement system” means a pension, annuity, retirement, or similar fund or system established by a State or by a political subdivision thereof.

If under the preceding sentence an employee would be included in more than one coverage group by reason of the fact that he performs service in connection with two or more proprietary functions or in connection with both a proprietary function and a nonproprietary function, he shall be included in only one such coverage group. The determination of the coverage group in which such employee shall be included shall be made in such manner as may be specified in the agreement. Persons employed under 
section 709 of title 32
, who elected under section 6 of the National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 to remain covered by an employee retirement system of, or plan sponsored by, a State or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be employees of the State or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and (notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph), shall be deemed to be a separate coverage group. For purposes of this section, individuals employed pursuant to an agreement, entered into pursuant to 
section 1624 of title 7

(c)
 Services covered
(1)
 An agreement under this section shall be applicable to any one or more coverage groups designated by the State.




(2)
 In the case of each coverage group to which the agreement applies, the agreement must include all services (other than services excluded by or pursuant to subsection (d) or paragraph (3), (5), or (6) of this subsection) performed by individuals as members of such group.




(3)
 Such agreement shall, if the State requests it, exclude (in the case of any coverage group) any one or more of the following:

(4)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall, at the request of any State, modify the agreement with such State so as to (A) include any coverage group to which the agreement did not previously apply, or (B) include, in the case of any coverage group to which the agreement applies, services previously excluded from the agreement; but the agreement as so modified may not be inconsistent with the provisions of this section applicable in the case of an original agreement with a State.

section 410(a) of this title
 other than paragraph (7) of such section,

(F)
 service described in 
section 410(a)(7)(F) of this title
 which is included as “employment” under 
section 410(a) of this title
.






(7)
 No agreement may be made applicable (either in the original agreement or by any modification thereof) to service performed by any individual to whom paragraph (3)(B) of this subsection is applicable unless such agreement provides (in the case of each coverage group involved) either that the service of any individual to whom such paragraph is applicable and who is a member of such coverage group shall continue to be covered by such agreement in case he thereafter becomes eligible to be a member of a retirement system, or that such service shall cease to be so covered when he becomes eligible to be a member of such a system (but only if the agreement is not already applicable to such system pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section), whichever may be desired by the State.




(8)
(A)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the agreement with any State entered into under this section may at the option of the State be modified at any time to exclude service performed by election officials or election workers if the remuneration paid in a calendar year for such service is less than $1,000 with respect to service performed during any calendar year commencing on or after 
January 1, 1995
, ending on or before 
December 31, 1999
, and the adjusted amount determined under subparagraph (B) for any calendar year commencing on or after 
January 1, 2000
, with respect to service performed during such calendar year. Any modification of an agreement pursuant to this paragraph shall be effective with respect to services performed in and after the calendar year in which the modification is mailed or delivered by other means to the Commissioner of Social Security.




(B)
 For each year after 1999, the Commissioner of Social Security shall adjust the amount referred to in subparagraph (A) at the same time and in the same manner as is provided under 
section 415(a)(1)(B)(ii) of this title
 with respect to the amounts referred to in 
section 415(a)(1)(B)(i) of this title
, except that—
(i)
 for purposes of this subparagraph, 1997 shall be substituted for the calendar year referred to in 
section 415(a)(1)(B)(ii)(II) of this title
, and




(ii)
 such amount as so adjusted, if not a multiple of $100, shall be rounded to the next higher multiple of $100 where such amount is a multiple of $50 and to the nearest multiple of $100 in any other case.





The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine and publish in the Federal Register each adjusted amount determined under this subparagraph not later than November 1 preceding the year for which the adjustment is made.






(d)
 Positions covered by retirement systems
(1)
 No agreement with any State may be made applicable (either in the original agreement or by any modification thereof) to any service performed by employees as members of any coverage group in positions covered by a retirement system either (A) on the date such agreement is made applicable to such coverage group, or (B) on 
September 1, 1954
 (except in the case of positions which are, by reason of action by such State or political subdivision thereof, as may be appropriate, taken prior to 
September 1, 1954
, no longer covered by a retirement system on the date referred to in clause (A), and except in the case of positions excluded by paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection). The preceding sentence shall not be applicable to any service performed by an employee as a member of any coverage group in a position (other than a position excluded by paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection) covered by a retirement system on the date an agreement is made applicable to such coverage group if, on such date (or, if later, the date on which such individual first occupies such position), such individual is ineligible to be a member of such system.




(2)
 It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in enacting the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection that the protection afforded employees in positions covered by a retirement system on the date an agreement under this section is made applicable to service performed in such positions, or receiving periodic benefits under such retirement system at such time, will not be impaired as a result of making the agreement so applicable or as a result of legislative enactment in anticipation thereof.




(3)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, an agreement with a State may be made applicable (either in the original agreement or by any modification thereof) to service performed by employees in positions covered by a retirement system (including positions specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection but not including positions excluded by or pursuant to paragraph (5)), if the governor of the State, or an official of the State designated by him for the purpose, certifies to the Commissioner of Social Security that the following conditions have been met:
(A)
 A referendum by secret written ballot was held on the question of whether service in positions covered by such retirement system should be excluded from or included under an agreement under this section;




(B)
 An opportunity to vote in such referendum was given (and was limited) to eligible employees;




(C)
 Not less than ninety days’ notice of such referendum was given to all such employees;




(D)
 Such referendum was conducted under the supervision of the governor or an agency or individual designated by him; and




(E)
 A majority of the eligible employees voted in favor of including service in such positions under an agreement under this section.





An employee shall be deemed an “eligible employee” for purposes of any referendum with respect to any retirement system if, at the time such referendum was held, he was in a position covered by such retirement system and was a member of such system, and if he was in such a position at the time notice of such referendum was given as required by clause (C) of the preceding sentence; except that he shall not be deemed an “eligible employee” if, at the time the referendum was held, he was in a position to which the State agreement already applied, or if he was in a position excluded by or pursuant to paragraph (5). No referendum with respect to a retirement system shall be valid for purposes of this paragraph unless held within the two-year period which ends on the date of execution of the agreement or modification which extends the insurance system established by this subchapter to such retirement system, nor shall any referendum with respect to a retirement system be valid for purposes of this paragraph if held less than one year after the last previous referendum held with respect to such retirement system.




(4)
 For the purposes of subsection (c) of this section, the following employees shall be deemed to be a separate coverage group—
(A)
 all employees in positions which were covered by the same retirement system on the date the agreement was made applicable to such system (other than employees to whose services the agreement already applied on such date);




(B)
 all employees in positions which became covered by such system at any time after such date; and




(C)
 all employees in positions which were covered by such system at any time before such date and to whose services the insurance system established by this subchapter has not been extended before such date because the positions were covered by such retirement system (including employees to whose services the agreement was not applicable on such date because such services were excluded pursuant to subsection (c)(3)(B) of this section).






(5)
(A)
 Nothing in paragraph (3) of this subsection shall authorize the extension of the insurance system established by this subchapter to service in any policeman’s or fireman’s position.




(B)
 At the request of the State, any class or classes of positions covered by a retirement system which may be excluded from the agreement pursuant to paragraph (3) or (5) of subsection (c) of this section, and to which the agreement does not already apply, may be excluded from the agreement at the time it is made applicable to such retirement system; except that, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (3)(B) of such subsection, such exclusion may not include any services to which such paragraph (3)(B) is applicable. In the case of any such exclusion, each such class so excluded shall, for purposes of this subsection, constitute a separate retirement system in case of any modification of the agreement thereafter agreed to.






(6)
(A)
 If a retirement system covers positions of employees of the State and positions of employees of one or more political subdivisions of the State, or covers positions of employees of two or more political subdivisions of the State, then, for purposes of the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, there shall, if the State so desires, be deemed to be a separate retirement system with respect to any one or more of the political subdivisions concerned and, where the retirement system covers positions of employees of the State, a separate retirement system with respect to the State or with respect to the State and any one or more of the political subdivisions concerned. Where a retirement system covering positions of employees of a State and positions of employees of one or more political subdivisions of the State, or covering positions of employees of two or more political subdivisions of the State, is not divided into separate retirement systems pursuant to the preceding sentence or pursuant to subparagraph (C), then the State may, for purposes of subsection (e) of this section only, deem the system to be a separate retirement system with respect to any one or more of the political subdivisions concerned and, where the retirement system covers positions of employees of the State, a separate retirement system with respect to the State or with respect to the State and any one or more of the political subdivisions concerned.




(B)
 If a retirement system covers positions of employees of one or more institutions of higher learning, then, for purposes of such preceding paragraphs there shall, if the State so desires, be deemed to be a separate retirement system for the employees of each such institution of higher learning. For the purposes of this subparagraph, the term “institutions of higher learning” includes junior colleges and teachers colleges. If a retirement system covers positions of employees of a hospital which is an integral part of a political subdivision, then, for purposes of the preceding paragraphs there shall, if the State so desires, be deemed to be a separate retirement system for the employees of such hospital.




(C)
 For the purposes of this subsection, any retirement system established by the State of Alaska, California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, or Hawaii, or any political subdivision of any such State, which, on, before, or after 
August 1, 1956
, is divided into two divisions or parts, one of which is composed of positions of members of such system who desire coverage under an agreement under this section and the other of which is composed of positions of members of such system who do not desire such coverage, shall, if the State so desires and if it is provided that there shall be included in such division or part composed of members desiring such coverage the positions of individuals who become members of such system after such coverage is extended, be deemed to be a separate retirement system with respect to each such division or part. If, in the case of a separate retirement system which is deemed to exist by reason of subparagraph (A) and which has been divided into two divisions or parts pursuant to the first sentence of this subparagraph, individuals become members of such system by reason of action taken by a political subdivision after coverage under an agreement under this section has been extended to the division or part thereof composed of positions of individuals who desire such coverage, the positions of such individuals who become members of such retirement system by reason of the action so taken shall be included in the division or part of such system composed of positions of members who do not desire such coverage if (i) such individuals, on the day before becoming such members, were in the division or part of another separate retirement system (deemed to exist by reason of subparagraph (A)) composed of positions of members of such system who do not desire coverage under an agreement under this section, and (ii) all of the positions in the separate retirement system of which such individuals so become members and all of the positions in the separate retirement system referred to in clause (i) would have been covered by a single retirement system if the State had not taken action to provide for separate retirement systems under this paragraph.




(D)
(i)
 The position of any individual which is covered by any retirement system to which subparagraph (C) is applicable shall, if such individual is ineligible to become a member of such system on 
August 1, 1956
, or, if later, the day he first occupies such position, be deemed to be covered by the separate retirement system consisting of the positions of members of the division or part who do not desire coverage under the insurance system established under this subchapter.




(ii)
 Notwithstanding clause (i), the State may, pursuant to subsection (c)(4)(B) of this section and subject to the conditions of continuation or termination of coverage provided for in subsection (c)(7) of this section, modify its agreement under this section to include services performed by all individuals described in clause (i) other than those individuals to whose services the agreement already applies. Such individuals shall be deemed (on and after the effective date of the modification) to be in positions covered by the separate retirement system consisting of the positions of members of the division or part who desire coverage under the insurance system established under this subchapter.






(E)
 An individual who is in a position covered by a retirement system to which subparagraph (C) is applicable and who is not a member of such system but is eligible to become a member thereof shall, for purposes of this subsection (other than paragraph (8) of this subsection), be regarded as a member of such system; except that, in the case of any retirement system a division or part of which is covered under the agreement (either in the original agreement or by a modification thereof), which coverage is agreed to prior to 1960, the preceding provisions of this subparagraph shall apply only if the State so requests and any such individual referred to in such preceding provisions shall, if the State so requests, be treated, after division of the retirement system pursuant to such subparagraph (C), the same as individuals in positions referred to in subparagraph (F).




(F)
 In the case of any retirement system divided pursuant to subparagraph (C), the position of any member of the division or part composed of positions of members who do not desire coverage may be transferred to the separate retirement system composed of positions of members who desire such coverage if it is so provided in a modification of such agreement which is mailed, or delivered by other means, to the Commissioner of Social Security prior to 1970 or, if later, the expiration of two years after the date on which such agreement, or the modification thereof making the agreement applicable to such separate retirement system, as the case may be, is agreed to, but only if, prior to such modification or such later modification, as the case may be, the individual occupying such position files with the State a written request for such transfer. Notwithstanding subsection (e)(1) of this section, any such modification or later modification, providing for the transfer of additional positions within a retirement system previously divided pursuant to subparagraph (C) to the separate retirement system composed of positions of members who desire coverage, shall be effective with respect to services performed after the same effective date as that which was specified in the case of such previous division.




(G)
 For the purposes of this subsection, in the case of any retirement system of the State of Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Washington, or Hawaii which covers positions of employees of such State who are compensated in whole or in part from grants made to such State under subchapter III of this chapter, there shall be deemed to be, if such State so desires, a separate retirement system with respect to any of the following:
(i)
 the positions of such employees;




(ii)
 the positions of all employees of such State covered by such retirement system who are employed in the department of such State in which the employees referred to in clause (i) are employed; or




(iii)
 employees of such State covered by such retirement system who are employed in such department of such State in positions others than those referred to in clause (i).








(7)
 The certification by the governor (or an official of the State designated by him for the purpose) required under paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have been made, in the case of a division or part (created under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (6) of this subsection or the corresponding provision of prior law) consisting of the positions of members of a retirement system who desire coverage under the agreement under this section, if the governor (or the official so designated) certifies to the Commissioner of Social Security that—
(A)
 an opportunity to vote by written ballot on the question of whether they wish to be covered under an agreement under this section was given to all individuals who were members of such system at the time the vote was held;




(B)
 not less than ninety days’ notice of such vote was given to all individuals who were members of such system on the date the notice was issued;




(C)
 the vote was conducted under the supervision of the governor or an agency or individual designated by him; and




(D)
 such system was divided into two parts or divisions in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (C) and (D) of paragraph (6) of this subsection or the corresponding provision of prior law.





For purposes of this paragraph, an individual in a position to which the State agreement already applied or in a position excluded by or pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection shall not be considered a member of the retirement system.




(8)
(A)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, if under the provisions of this subsection an agreement is, after 
December 31, 1958
, made applicable to service performed in positions covered by a retirement system, service performed by an individual in a position covered by such a system may not be excluded from the agreement because such position is also covered under another retirement system.




(B)
 Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to service performed by an individual in a position covered under a retirement system if such individual, on the day the agreement is made applicable to service performed in positions covered by such retirement system, is not a member of such system and is a member of another system.




(C)
 If an agreement is made applicable, prior to 1959, to service in positions covered by any retirement system, the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable in the case of such system if the agreement is modified to so provide.




(D)
 Except in the case of State agreements modified as provided in subsection (
l
) of this section and agreements with interstate instrumentalities, nothing in this paragraph shall authorize the application of an agreement to service in any policeman’s or fireman’s position.






(e)
 Effective date of agreement; retroactive coverage
(1)
 Any agreement or modification of an agreement under this section shall be effective with respect to services performed after an effective date specified in such agreement or modification; except that such date may not be earlier than the last day of the sixth calendar year preceding the year in which such agreement or modification, as the case may be, is mailed or delivered by other means to the Commissioner of Social Security.




(2)
 In the case of service performed by members of any coverage group—
(A)
 to which an agreement under this section is made applicable, and




(B)
 with respect to which the agreement, or modification thereof making the agreement so applicable, specifies an effective date earlier than the date of execution of such agreement and such modification, respectively,





the agreement shall, if so requested by the State, be applicable to such services (to the extent the agreement was not already applicable) performed before such date of execution and after such effective date by any individual as a member of such coverage group if he is such a member on a date, specified by the State, which is earlier than such date of execution, except that in no case may the date so specified be earlier than the date such agreement or such modification, as the case may be, is mailed, or delivered by other means, to the Commissioner of Social Security.




(3)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, in the case of services performed by individuals as members of any coverage group to which an agreement under this section is made applicable, and with respect to which there were timely paid in good faith to the Secretary of the Treasury amounts equivalent to the sum of the taxes which would have been imposed by sections 3101 and 3111 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 had such services constituted employment for purposes of chapter 21 of such Code at the time they were performed, and with respect to which refunds were not obtained, such individuals may, if so requested by the State, be deemed to be members of such coverage group on the date designated pursuant to paragraph (2).




(f)
 Duration of agreement
No agreement under this section may be terminated, either in its entirety or with respect to any coverage group, on or after 
April 20, 1983
.




(g)
 Instrumentalities of two or more States
(1)
 The Commissioner of Social Security may, at the request of any instrumentality of two or more States, enter into an agreement with such instrumentality for the purpose of extending the insurance system established by this subchapter to services performed by individuals as employees of such instrumentality. Such agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be governed by the provisions of this section applicable in the case of an agreement with a State.




(2)
 In the case of any instrumentality of two or more States, if—
(A)
 employees of such instrumentality are in positions covered by a retirement system of such instrumentality or of any of such States or any of the political subdivisions thereof, and




(B)
 such retirement system is (on, before, or after 
August 30, 1957
) divided into two divisions or parts, one of which is composed of positions of members of such system who are employees of such instrumentality and who desire coverage under an agreement under this section and the other of which is composed of positions of members of such system who are employees of such instrumentality and who do not desire such coverage, and




(C)
 it is provided that there shall be included in such division or part composed of the positions of members desiring such coverage the positions of employees of such instrumentality who become members of such system after such coverage is extended,





then such retirement system shall, if such instrumentality so desires, be deemed to be a separate retirement system with respect to each such division or part. An individual who is in a position covered by a retirement system divided pursuant to the preceding sentence and who is not a member of such system but is eligible to become a member thereof shall, for purposes of this subsection, be regarded as a member of such system. Coverage under the agreement of any such individual shall be provided under the same conditions, to the extent practicable, as are applicable in the case of the States to which the provisions of subsection (d)(6)(C) of this section apply. The position of any employee of any such instrumentality which is covered by any retirement system to which the first sentence of this paragraph is applicable shall, if such individual is ineligible to become a member of such system on 
August 30, 1957
, or, if later, the day he first occupies such position, be deemed to be covered by the separate retirement system consisting of the positions of members of the division or part who do not desire coverage under the insurance system established under this subchapter.

 Disability determinations
(a)
 State agencies
(1)
 In the case of any individual, the determination of whether or not he is under a disability (as defined in section 416(i) or 423(d) of this title) and of the day such disability began, and the determination of the day on which such disability ceases, shall be made by a State agency, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any State that notifies the Commissioner of Social Security in writing that it wishes to make such disability determinations commencing with such month as the Commissioner of Social Security and the State agree upon, but only if (A) the Commissioner of Social Security has not found, under subsection (b)(1) of this section, that the State agency has substantially failed to make disability determinations in accordance with the applicable provisions of this section or rules issued thereunder, and (B) the State has not notified the Commissioner of Social Security, under subsection (b)(2) of this section, that it does not wish to make such determinations. If the Commissioner of Social Security once makes the finding described in clause (A) of the preceding sentence, or the State gives the notice referred to in clause (B) of such sentence, the Commissioner of Social Security may thereafter determine whether (and, if so, beginning with which month and under what conditions) the State may again make disability determinations under this paragraph.




(2)
 The disability determinations described in paragraph (1) made by a State agency shall be made in accordance with the pertinent provisions of this subchapter and the standards and criteria contained in regulations or other written guidelines of the Commissioner of Social Security pertaining to matters such as disability determinations, the class or classes of individuals with respect to which a State may make disability determinations (if it does not wish to do so with respect to all individuals in the State), and the conditions under which it may choose not to make all such determinations. In addition, the Commissioner of Social Security shall promulgate regulations specifying, in such detail as the Commissioner deems appropriate, performance standards and administrative requirements and procedures to be followed in performing the disability determination function in order to assure effective and uniform administration of the disability insurance program throughout the United States. The regulations may, for example, specify matters such as—
(A)
 the administrative structure and the relationship between various units of the State agency responsible for disability determinations,




(B)
 the physical location of and relationship among agency staff units, and other individuals or organizations performing tasks for the State agency, and standards for the availability to applicants and beneficiaries of facilities for making disability determinations,




(C)
 State agency performance criteria, including the rate of accuracy of decisions, the time periods within which determinations must be made, the procedures for and the scope of review by the Commissioner of Social Security, and, as the Commissioner finds appropriate, by the State, of its performance in individual cases and in classes of cases, and rules governing access of appropriate Federal officials to State offices and to State records relating to its administration of the disability determination function,




(D)
 fiscal control procedures that the State agency may be required to adopt, and




(E)
 the submission of reports and other data, in such form and at such time as the Commissioner of Social Security may require, concerning the State agency’s activities relating to the disability determination.





Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the Commissioner of Social Security to take any action except pursuant to law or to regulations promulgated pursuant to law.




(b)
 Determinations by Commissioner
(1)
 If the Commissioner of Social Security finds, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that a State agency is substantially failing to make disability determinations in a manner consistent with the Commissioner’s regulations and other written guidelines, the Commissioner of Social Security shall, not earlier than 180 days following the Commissioner’s finding, and after the Commissioner has complied with the requirements of paragraph (3), make the disability determinations referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section.




(2)
 If a State, having notified the Commissioner of Social Security of its intent to make disability determinations under subsection (a)(1) of this section, no longer wishes to make such determinations, it shall notify the Commissioner of Social Security in writing of that fact, and, if an agency of the State is making disability determinations at the time such notice is given, it shall continue to do so for not less than 180 days, or (if later) until the Commissioner of Social Security has complied with the requirements of paragraph (3). Thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make the disability determinations referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section.




(3)
(A)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall develop and initiate all appropriate procedures to implement a plan with respect to any partial or complete assumption by the Commissioner of Social Security of the disability determination function from a State agency, as provided in this section, under which employees of the affected State agency who are capable of performing duties in the disability determination process for the Commissioner of Social Security shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, have a preference over any other individual in filling an appropriate employment position with the Commissioner of Social Security (subject to any system established by the Commissioner of Social Security for determining hiring priority among such employees of the State agency) unless any such employee is the administrator, the deputy administrator, or assistant administrator (or his equivalent) of the State agency, in which case the Commissioner of Social Security may accord such priority to such employee.




(B)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall not make such assumption of the disability determination function until such time as the Secretary of Labor determines that, with respect to employees of such State agency who will be displaced from their employment on account of such assumption by the Commissioner of Social Security and who will not be hired by the Commissioner of Social Security to perform duties in the disability determination process, the State has made fair and equitable arrangements to protect the interests of employees so displaced. Such protective arrangements shall include only those provisions which are provided under all applicable Federal, State and local statutes including, but not limited to, (i) the preservation of rights, privileges, and benefits (including continuation of pension rights and benefits) under existing collective-bargaining agreements; (ii) the continuation of collective-bargaining rights; (iii) the assignment of affected employees to other jobs or to retraining programs; (iv) the protection of individual employees against a worsening of their positions with respect to their employment; (v) the protection of health benefits and other fringe benefits; and (vi) the provision of severance pay, as may be necessary.






(c)

 The Commissioner of Social Security may on the Commissioner’s own motion or as required under paragraphs (2) and (3) review a determination, made by a State agency under this section, that an individual is or is not under a disability (as defined in section 416(i) or 423(d) of this title) and, as a result of such review, may modify such agency’s determination and determine that such individual either is or is not under a disability (as so defined) or that such individual’s disability began on a day earlier or later than that determined by such agency, or that such disability ceased on a day earlier or later than that determined by such agency. A review by the Commissioner of Social Security on the Commissioner’s own motion of a State agency determination under this paragraph may be made before or after any action is taken to implement such determination.




(2)
 The Commissioner of Social Security (in accordance with paragraph (3)) shall review determinations, made by State agencies pursuant to this section, that individuals are under disabilities (as defined in section 416(i) or 423(d) of this title). Any review by the Commissioner of Social Security of a State agency determination under this paragraph shall be made before any action is taken to implement such determination.




(3)
(A)
 In carrying out the provisions of paragraph (2) with respect to the review of determinations made by State agencies pursuant to this section that individuals are under disabilities (as defined in section 416(i) or 423(d) of this title), the Commissioner of Social Security shall review—
(i)
 at least 50 percent of all such determinations made by State agencies on applications for benefits under this subchapter, and




(ii)
 other determinations made by State agencies pursuant to this section to the extent necessary to assure a high level of accuracy in such other determinations.






(B)
 In conducting reviews pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Commissioner of Social Security shall, to the extent feasible, select for review those determinations which the Commissioner of Social Security identifies as being the most likely to be incorrect.




(C)
 Not later than 
April 1, 1992
, and annually thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a written report setting forth the number of reviews conducted under subparagraph (A)(ii) during the preceding fiscal year and the findings of the Commissioner of Social Security based on such reviews of the accuracy of the determinations made by State agencies pursuant to this section.






(d)
 Hearings and judicial review
Any individual dissatisfied with any determination under subsection (a), (b), (c), or (g) of this section shall be entitled to a hearing thereon by the Commissioner of Social Security to the same extent as is provided in 
section 405(b) of this title
 with respect to decisions of the Commissioner of Social Security, and to judicial review of the Commissioner’s final decision after such hearing as is provided in 
section 405(g) of this title
.




(e)
 State’s right to cost from Trust Funds
Each State which is making disability determinations under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be entitled to receive from the Trust Funds, in advance or by way of reimbursement, as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security, the cost to the State of making disability determinations under subsection (a)(1) of this section. The Commissioner of Social Security shall from time to time certify such amount as is necessary for this purpose to the Managing Trustee, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (for which adjustment hereunder has not previously been made) by which the amount certified for any prior period was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State under this subsection for such period; and the Managing Trustee, prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, shall make payment from the Trust Funds at the time or times fixed by the Commissioner of Social Security, in accordance with such certification. Appropriate adjustments between the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund with respect to the payments made under this subsection shall be made in accordance with paragraph (1) of subsection (g) of 
section 401 of this title
 (but taking into account any refunds under subsection (f) of this section) to insure that the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund is charged with all expenses incurred which are attributable to the administration of 
section 423 of this title
 and the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is charged with all other expenses.




(f)
 Use of funds
All money paid to a State under this section shall be used solely for the purposes for which it is paid; and any money so paid which is not used for such purposes shall be returned to the Treasury of the United States for deposit in the Trust Funds.




(g)
 Regulations governing determinations in certain cases
In the case of individuals in a State which does not undertake to perform disability determinations under subsection (a)(1) of this section, or which has been found by the Commissioner of Social Security to have substantially failed to make disability determinations in a manner consistent with the Commissioner’s regulations and guidelines, in the case of individuals outside the United States, and in the case of any class or classes of individuals for whom no State undertakes to make disability determinations, the determinations referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be made by the Commissioner of Social Security in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner.




(h)
 Evaluation of mental impairments by qualified medical professionals
An initial determination under subsection (a), (c), (g), or (i) of this section that an individual is not under a disability, in any case where there is evidence which indicates the existence of a mental impairment, shall be made only if the Commissioner of Social Security has made every reasonable effort to ensure that a qualified psychiatrist or psychologist has completed the medical portion of the case review and any applicable residual functional capacity assessment.




(i)
 Review of disability cases to determine continuing eligibility; permanent disability cases; appropriate number of cases reviewed; reporting requirements
(1)
 In any case where an individual is or has been determined to be under a disability, the case shall be reviewed by the applicable State agency or the Commissioner of Social Security (as may be appropriate), for purposes of continuing eligibility, at least once every 3 years, subject to paragraph (2); except that where a finding has been made that such disability is permanent, such reviews shall be made at such times as the Commissioner of Social Security determines to be appropriate. Reviews of cases under the preceding sentence shall be in addition to, and shall not be considered as a substitute for, any other reviews which are required or provided for under or in the administration of this subchapter.




(2)
 The requirement of paragraph (1) that cases be reviewed at least every 3 years shall not apply to the extent that the Commissioner of Social Security determines, on a State-by-State basis, that such requirement should be waived to insure that only the appropriate number of such cases are reviewed. The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine the appropriate number of cases to be reviewed in each State after consultation with the State agency performing such reviews, based upon the backlog of pending reviews, the projected number of new applications for disability insurance benefits, and the current and projected staffing levels of the State agency, but the Commissioner of Social Security shall provide for a waiver of such requirement only in the case of a State which makes a good faith effort to meet proper staffing requirements for the State agency and to process case reviews in a timely fashion.

(4)
 In any case in which the Commissioner of Social Security initiates a review under this subsection of the case of an individual who has been determined to be under a disability, the Commissioner of Social Security shall notify such individual of the nature of the review to be carried out, the possibility that such review could result in the termination of benefits, and the right of the individual to provide medical evidence with respect to such review.




(5)

 the standards to be utilized by State disability determination services and Federal personnel in determining when a consultative examination should be obtained in connection with disability determinations;




(2)
 standards for the type of referral to be made; and




(3)
 procedures by which the Commissioner of Social Security will monitor both the referral processes used and the product of professionals to whom cases are referred.





Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude the issuance, in accordance with 
section 553(b)(A) of title 5
, of interpretive rules, general statements of policy, and rules of agency organization relating to consultative examinations if such rules and statements are consistent with such regulations.


(k)
 Establishment of uniform standards for determination of disability
(1)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall establish by regulation uniform standards which shall be applied at all levels of determination, review, and adjudication in determining whether individuals are under disabilities as defined in section 416(i) or 423(d) of this title.




(2)
 Regulations promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be subject to the rulemaking procedures established under 
section 553 of title 5
.




(l)
 Special notice to blind individuals with respect to hearings and other official actions
(1)
 In any case where an individual who is applying for or receiving benefits under this subchapter on the basis of disability by reason of blindness is entitled to receive notice from the Commissioner of Social Security of any decision or determination made or other action taken or proposed to be taken with respect to his or her rights under this subchapter, such individual shall at his or her election be entitled either (A) to receive a supplementary notice of such decision, determination, or action, by telephone, within 5 working days after the initial notice is mailed, (B) to receive the initial notice in the form of a certified letter, or (C) to receive notification by some alternative procedure established by the Commissioner of Social Security and agreed to by the individual.




(2)
 The election under paragraph (1) may be made at any time, but an opportunity to make such an election shall in any event be given, to every individual who is an applicant for benefits under this subchapter on the basis of disability by reason of blindness, at the time of his or her application. Such an election, once made by an individual, shall apply with respect to all notices of decisions, determinations, and actions which such individual may thereafter be entitled to receive under this subchapter until such time as it is revoked or changed.




(m)
 Work activity as basis for review
(1)
 In any case where an individual entitled to disability insurance benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 or to monthly insurance benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 based on such individual’s disability (as defined in 
section 423(d) of this title
) has received such benefits for at least 24 months—
(A)
 no continuing disability review conducted by the Commissioner may be scheduled for the individual solely as a result of the individual’s work activity;




(B)
 no work activity engaged in by the individual may be used as evidence that the individual is no longer disabled; and




(C)
 no cessation of work activity by the individual may give rise to a presumption that the individual is unable to engage in work.






(2)
 An individual to which paragraph (1) applies shall continue to be subject to—
(A)
 continuing disability reviews on a regularly scheduled basis that is not triggered by work; and




(B)
 termination of benefits under this subchapter in the event that the individual has earnings that exceed the level of earnings established by the Commissioner to represent substantial gainful activity.






“(a)
 The Secretary of Health and Human Services (hereafter in this section referred to as the ‘Secretary’) shall revise the criteria embodied under the category ‘Mental Disorders’ in the ‘Listing of Impairments’ in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act [
Oct. 9, 1984
] under appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 of title 20 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The revised criteria and listings, alone and in combination with assessments of the residual functional capacity of the individuals involved, shall be designed to realistically evaluate the ability of a mentally impaired individual to engage in substantial gainful activity in a competitive workplace environment. Regulations establishing such revised criteria and listings shall be published no later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.


“(b)
(1)
 Until such time as revised criteria have been established by regulation in accordance with subsection (a), no continuing eligibility review shall be carried out under section 221(i) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 421(i)
], or under the corresponding requirements established for disability determinations and reviews under title XVI of such Act [
42 U.S.C. 1381
 et seq.], with respect to any individual previously determined to be under a disability by reason of a mental impairment, if—
“(A)
 no initial decision on such review has been rendered with respect to such individual prior to the date of the enactment of this Act, or




“(B)
 an initial decision on such review was rendered with respect to such individual prior to the date of the enactment of this Act but a timely appeal from such decision was filed or was pending on or after 
June 7, 1983
.





For purposes of this paragraph and subsection (c)(1) the term ‘continuing eligibility review’, when used to refer to a review of a previous determination of disability, includes any reconsideration of or hearing on the initial decision rendered in such review as well as such initial decision itself, and any review by the Appeals Council of the hearing decision.




“(2)
 Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any case where the Secretary determines that fraud was involved in the prior determination, or where an individual (other than an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 1619 of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 1382h
]) is determined by the Secretary to be engaged in substantial gainful activity (or gainful activity, in the case of a widow, surviving divorced wife, widower, or surviving divorced husband for purposes of section 202(e) and (f) of such Act [
42 U.S.C. 402(e)
, (f)]).




“(c)
(1)
 Any initial determination that an individual is not under a disability by reason of a mental impairment and any determination that an individual is not under a disability by reason of a mental impairment in a reconsideration of or hearing on an initial disability determination, made or held under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq., 1381 et seq.] after the date of the enactment of this Act [
Oct. 9, 1984
] and prior to the date on which revised criteria are established by regulation in accordance with subsection (a), and any determination that an individual is not under a disability by reason of a mental impairment made under or in accordance with title II or XVI of such Act in a reconsideration of, hearing on, review by the Appeals Council of, or judicial review of a decision rendered in any continuing eligibility review to which subsection (b)(1) applies, shall be redetermined by the Secretary as soon as feasible after the date on which such criteria are so established, applying such revised criteria.




“(2)
 In the case of a redetermination under paragraph (1) of a prior action which found that an individual was not under a disability, if such individual is found on redetermination to be under a disability, such redetermination shall be applied as though it had been made at the time of such prior action.




“(3)
 Any individual with a mental impairment who was found to be not disabled pursuant to an initial disability determination or a continuing eligibility review between 
March 1, 1981
, and the date of the enactment of this Act [
Oct. 9, 1984
], and who reapplies for benefits under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act, may be determined to be under a disability during the period considered in the most recent prior determination. Any reapplication under this paragraph must be filed within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and benefits payable as a result of the preceding sentence shall be paid only on the basis of the reapplication.”

(c)
 “Period of trial work” defined
(1)
 The term “period of trial work”, with respect to an individual entitled to benefits under section 423, 402(d), 402(e), or 402(f) of this title, means a period of months beginning and ending as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4).




(2)
 For purposes of sections 416(i) and 423 of this title, any services rendered by an individual during a period of trial work shall be deemed not to have been rendered by such individual in determining whether his disability has ceased in a month during such period. For purposes of this subsection the term “services” means activity (whether legal or illegal) which is performed for remuneration or gain or is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be of a type normally performed for remuneration or gain.




(3)
 A period of trial work for any individual shall begin with the month in which he becomes entitled to disability insurance benefits, or, in the case of an individual entitled to benefits under 
section 402(d) of this title
 who has attained the age of eighteen, with the month in which he becomes entitled to such benefits or the month in which he attains the age of eighteen, whichever is later, or, in the case of an individual entitled to widow’s or widower’s insurance benefits under section 402(e) or (f) of this title who became entitled to such benefits prior to attaining age 60, with the month in which such individual becomes so entitled. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no period of trial work may begin for any individual prior to the beginning of the month following September 1960; and no such period may begin for an individual in a period of disability of such individual in which he had a previous period of trial work.




(4)
 A period of trial work for any individual shall end with the close of whichever of the following months is the earlier:
(A)
 the ninth month, in any period of 60 consecutive months, in which the individual renders services (whether or not such nine months are consecutive); or




(B)
 the month in which his disability (as defined in 
section 423(d) of this title
) ceases (as determined after application of paragraph (2) of this subsection).






(5)
 Upon conviction by a Federal court that an individual has fraudulently concealed work activity during a period of trial work from the Commissioner of Social Security by—
(A)
 providing false information to the Commissioner of Social Security as to whether the individual had earnings in or for a particular period, or as to the amount thereof;




(B)
 receiving disability insurance benefits under this subchapter while engaging in work activity under another identity, including under another social security account number or a number purporting to be a social security account number; or




(C)
 taking other actions to conceal work activity with an intent fraudulently to secure payment in a greater amount than is due or when no payment is authorized,





no benefit shall be payable to such individual under this subchapter with respect to a period of disability for any month before such conviction during which the individual rendered services during the period of trial work with respect to which the fraudulently concealed work activity occurred, and amounts otherwise due under this subchapter as restitution, penalties, assessments, fines, or other repayments shall in all cases be in addition to any amounts for which such individual is liable as overpayments by reason of such concealment.




(d)
 Cost of rehabilitation services from trust funds
(1)
 For purposes of making vocational rehabilitation services more readily available to disabled individuals who are—
(A)
 entitled to disability insurance benefits under 
section 423 of this title
,




(B)
 entitled to child’s insurance benefits under 
section 402(d) of this title
 after having attained age 18 (and are under a disability),




(C)
 entitled to widow’s insurance benefits under 
section 402(e) of this title
 prior to attaining age 60, or




(D)
 entitled to widower’s insurance benefits under 
section 402(f) of this title
 prior to attaining age 60,





to the end that savings will accrue to the Trust Funds as a result of rehabilitating such individuals, there are authorized to be transferred from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary to enable the Commissioner of Social Security to reimburse the State for the reasonable and necessary costs of vocational rehabilitation services furnished such individuals (including services during their waiting periods), under a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [
29 U.S.C. 720
 et seq.], (i) in cases where the furnishing of such services results in the performance by such individuals of substantial gainful activity for a continuous period of nine months, (ii) in cases where such individuals receive benefits as a result of 
section 425(b) of this title
 (except that no reimbursement under this paragraph shall be made for services furnished to any individual receiving such benefits for any period after the close of such individual’s ninth consecutive month of substantial gainful activity or the close of the month in which his or her entitlement to such benefits ceases, whichever first occurs), and (iii) in cases where such individuals, without good cause, refuse to continue to accept vocational rehabilitation services or fail to cooperate in such a manner as to preclude their successful rehabilitation. The determination that the vocational rehabilitation services contributed to the successful return of an individual to substantial gainful activity, the determination that an individual, without good cause, refused to continue to accept vocational rehabilitation services or failed to cooperate in such a manner as to preclude successful rehabilitation, and the determination of the amount of costs to be reimbursed under this subsection shall be made by the Commissioner of Social Security in accordance with criteria formulated by the Commissioner.




(2)
 In the case of any State which is unwilling to participate or does not have a plan which meets the requirements of paragraph (1), the Commissioner of Social Security may provide such services in such State by agreement or contract with other public or private agencies, organizations, institutions, or individuals. The provision of such services shall be subject to the same conditions as otherwise apply under paragraph (1).




(3)
 Payments under this subsection shall be made in advance or by way of reimbursement, with necessary adjustments for overpayments and underpayments.




(4)
 Money paid from the Trust Funds under this subsection for the reimbursement of the costs of providing services to individuals who are entitled to benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 (including services during their waiting periods), or who are entitled to benefits under 
section 402(d) of this title
 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individuals, shall be charged to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and all other money paid from the Trust Funds under this subsection shall be charged to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine according to such methods and procedures as the Commissioner may deem appropriate—
(A)
 the total amount to be reimbursed for the cost of services under this subsection, and




(B)
 subject to the provisions of the preceding sentence, the amount which should be charged to each of the Trust Funds.






(5)
 For purposes of this subsection the term “vocational rehabilitation services” shall have the meaning assigned to it in title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [
29 U.S.C. 720
 et seq.], except that such services may be limited in type, scope, or amount in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security designed to achieve the purpose of this subsection.




(e)
 Treatment referrals for individuals with alcoholism or drug addiction condition
In the case of any individual whose benefits under this subchapter are paid to a representative payee pursuant to 
section 405(j)(1)(B) of this title
, the Commissioner of Social Security shall refer such individual to the appropriate State agency administering the State plan for substance abuse treatment services approved under subpart II of part B of title XIX of the Public Health Service Act (
42 U.S.C. 300x–21
 et seq.).

 So in original. The period probably should be a comma.








(D)
 has filed application for disability insurance benefits, and




(E)
 is under a disability (as defined in subsection (d) of this section)





shall be entitled to a disability insurance benefit (i) for each month beginning with the first month after his waiting period (as defined in subsection (c)(2) of this section) in which he becomes so entitled to such insurance benefits, or (ii) for each month beginning with the first month during all of which he is under a disability and in which he becomes so entitled to such insurance benefits, but only if he was entitled to disability insurance benefits which terminated, or had a period of disability (as defined in 
section 416(i) of this title
) which ceased, within the 60-month period preceding the first month in which he is under such disability, and ending with the month preceding whichever of the following months is the earliest: the month in which he dies, the month in which he attains retirement age (as defined in section 416(
l
) of this title), or, subject to subsection (e) of this section, the termination month. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the termination month for any individual shall be the third month following the month in which his disability ceases; except that, in the case of an individual who has a period of trial work which ends as determined by application of 
section 422(c)(4)(A) of this title
, the termination month shall be the earlier of (I) the third month following the earliest month after the end of such period of trial work with respect to which such individual is determined to no longer be suffering from a disabling physical or mental impairment, or (II) the third month following the earliest month in which such individual engages or is determined able to engage in substantial gainful activity, but in no event earlier than the first month occurring after the 36 months following such period of trial work in which he engages or is determined able to engage in substantial gainful activity. No payment under this paragraph may be made to an individual who would not meet the definition of disability in subsection (d) of this section except for paragraph (1)(B) thereof for any month in which he engages in substantial gainful activity, and no payment may be made for such month under subsection (b), (c), or (d) of 
section 402 of this title
 to any person on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individual. In the case of a deceased individual, the requirement of subparagraph (C) may be satisfied by an application for benefits filed with respect to such individual within 3 months after the month in which he died.




(2)
 Except as provided in 
section 402(q) of this title
 and 
section 415(b)(2)(A)(ii) of this title
, such individual’s disability insurance benefit for any month shall be equal to his primary insurance amount for such month determined under 
section 415 of this title
 as though he had attained age 62 in—
(A)
 the first month of his waiting period, or




(B)
 in any case in which clause (ii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection is applicable, the first month for which he becomes entitled to such disability insurance benefits,





and as though he had become entitled to old-age insurance benefits in the month in which the application for disability insurance benefits was filed and he was entitled to an old-age insurance benefit for each month for which (pursuant to subsection (b) of this section) he was entitled to a disability insurance benefit. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, in the case of an individual who attained age 62 in or before the first month referred to in subparagraph (A) or (B) of such sentence, as the case may be, the elapsed years referred to in 
section 415(b)(3) of this title
 shall not include the year in which he attained age 62, or any year thereafter.




(b)
 Filing application
An application for disability insurance benefits filed before the first month in which the applicant satisfies the requirements for such benefits (as prescribed in subsection (a)(1) of this section) shall be deemed a valid application (and shall be deemed to have been filed in such first month) only if the applicant satisfies the requirements for such benefits before the Commissioner of Social Security makes a final decision on the application and no request under 
section 405(b) of this title
 for notice and opportunity for a hearing thereon is made, or if such a request is made, before a decision based upon the evidence adduced at the hearing is made (regardless of whether such decision becomes the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security). An individual who would have been entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any month had he filed application therefor before the end of such month shall be entitled to such benefit for such month if such application is filed before the end of the 12th month immediately succeeding such month.




(c)
 Definitions; insured status; waiting period
For purposes of this section—
(1)
 An individual shall be insured for disability insurance benefits in any month if—
(A)
 he would have been a fully insured individual (as defined in 
section 414 of this title
) had he attained age 62 and filed application for benefits under 
section 402(a) of this title
 on the first day of such month, and




(B)
(i)
 he had not less than 20 quarters of coverage during the 40-quarter period which ends with the quarter in which such month occurred, or




(ii)
 if such month ends before the quarter in which he attains (or would attain) age 31, not less than one-half (and not less than 6) of the quarters during the period ending with the quarter in which such month occurred and beginning after he attained the age of 21 were quarters of coverage, or (if the number of quarters in such period is less than 12) not less than 6 of the quarters in the 12-quarter period ending with such quarter were quarters of coverage, or




(iii)
 in the case of an individual (not otherwise insured under clause (i)) who, by reason of 
section 416(i)(3)(B)(ii) of this title
, had a prior period of disability that began during a period before the quarter in which he or she attained age 31, not less than one-half of the quarters beginning after such individual attained age 21 and ending with the quarter in which such month occurs are quarters of coverage, or (if the number of quarters in such period is less than 12) not less than 6 of the quarters in the 12-quarter period ending with such quarter are quarters of coverage;







except that the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of an individual who is blind (within the meaning of “blindness” as defined in 
section 416(i)(1) of this title
). For purposes of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, when the number of quarters in any period is an odd number, such number shall be reduced by one, and a quarter shall not be counted as part of any period if any part of such quarter was included in a period of disability unless such quarter was a quarter of coverage.




(2)
 The term “waiting period” means, in the case of any application for disability insurance benefits, the earliest period of five consecutive calendar months—
(A)
 throughout which the individual with respect to whom such application is filed has been under a disability, and




(B)
(i)
 which begins not earlier than with the first day of the seventeenth month before the month in which such application is filed if such individual is insured for disability insurance benefits in such seventeenth month, or (ii) if he is not so insured in such month, which begins not earlier than with the first day of the first month after such seventeenth month in which he is so insured.







Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, no waiting period may begin for any individual before 
January 1, 1957
.




(d)
 “Disability” defined
(1)
 The term “disability” means—
(A)
 inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months; or




(B)
 in the case of an individual who has attained the age of 55 and is blind (within the meaning of “blindness” as defined in 
section 416(i)(1) of this title
), inability by reason of such blindness to engage in substantial gainful activity requiring skills or abilities comparable to those of any gainful activity in which he has previously engaged with some regularity and over a substantial period of time.






(2)
 For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)—
(A)
 An individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. For purposes of the preceding sentence (with respect to any individual), “work which exists in the national economy” means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.




(B)
 In determining whether an individual’s physical or mental impairment or impairments are of a sufficient medical severity that such impairment or impairments could be the basis of eligibility under this section, the Commissioner of Social Security shall consider the combined effect of all of the individual’s impairments without regard to whether any such impairment, if considered separately, would be of such severity. If the Commissioner of Social Security does find a medically severe combination of impairments, the combined impact of the impairments shall be considered throughout the disability determination process.




(C)
 An individual shall not be considered to be disabled for purposes of this subchapter if alcoholism or drug addiction would (but for this subparagraph) be a contributing factor material to the Commissioner’s determination that the individual is disabled.






(3)
 For purposes of this subsection, a “physical or mental impairment” is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.




(4)
(A)
 The Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulations prescribe the criteria for determining when services performed or earnings derived from services demonstrate an individual’s ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. No individual who is blind shall be regarded as having demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity on the basis of earnings that do not exceed an amount equal to the exempt amount which would be applicable under 
section 403(f)(8) of this title
, to individuals described in subparagraph (D) thereof, if section 102 of the Senior Citizens’ Right to Work Act of 1996 had not been enacted. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), an individual whose services or earnings meet such criteria shall, except for purposes of 
section 422(c) of this title
, be found not to be disabled. In determining whether an individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of his earnings, where his disability is sufficiently severe to result in a functional limitation requiring assistance in order for him to work, there shall be excluded from such earnings an amount equal to the cost (to such individual) of any attendant care services, medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (not including routine drugs or routine medical services unless such drugs or services are necessary for the control of the disabling condition) which are necessary (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security in regulations) for that purpose, whether or not such assistance is also needed to enable him to carry out his normal daily functions; except that the amounts to be excluded shall be subject to such reasonable limits as the Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe.




(B)
 In determining under subparagraph (A) when services performed or earnings derived from services demonstrate an individual’s ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply the criteria described in subparagraph (A) with respect to services performed by any individual without regard to the legality of such services.






(5)
(A)
 An individual shall not be considered to be under a disability unless he furnishes such medical and other evidence of the existence thereof as the Commissioner of Social Security may require. An individual’s statement as to pain or other symptoms shall not alone be conclusive evidence of disability as defined in this section; there must be medical signs and findings, established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques, which show the existence of a medical impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged and which, when considered with all evidence required to be furnished under this paragraph (including statements of the individual or his physician as to the intensity and persistence of such pain or other symptoms which may reasonably be accepted as consistent with the medical signs and findings), would lead to a conclusion that the individual is under a disability. Objective medical evidence of pain or other symptoms established by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory techniques (for example, deteriorating nerve or muscle tissue) must be considered in reaching a conclusion as to whether the individual is under a disability. Any non-Federal hospital, clinic, laboratory, or other provider of medical services, or physician not in the employ of the Federal Government, which supplies medical evidence required and requested by the Commissioner of Social Security under this paragraph shall be entitled to payment from the Commissioner of Social Security for the reasonable cost of providing such evidence.




(B)
 In making any determination with respect to whether an individual is under a disability or continues to be under a disability, the Commissioner of Social Security shall consider all evidence available in such individual’s case record, and shall develop a complete medical history of at least the preceding twelve months for any case in which a determination is made that the individual is not under a disability. In making any determination the Commissioner of Social Security shall make every reasonable effort to obtain from the individual’s treating physician (or other treating health care provider) all medical evidence, including diagnostic tests, necessary in order to properly make such determination, prior to evaluating medical evidence obtained from any other source on a consultative basis.






(6)
(A)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, any physical or mental impairment which arises in connection with the commission by an individual (after 
October 19, 1980
) of an offense which constitutes a felony under applicable law and for which such individual is subsequently convicted, or which is aggravated in connection with such an offense (but only to the extent so aggravated), shall not be considered in determining whether an individual is under a disability.




(B)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, any physical or mental impairment which arises in connection with an individual’s confinement in a jail, prison, or other penal institution or correctional facility pursuant to such individual’s conviction of an offense (committed after 
October 19, 1980
) constituting a felony under applicable law, or which is aggravated in connection with such a confinement (but only to the extent so aggravated), shall not be considered in determining whether such individual is under a disability for purposes of benefits payable for any month during which such individual is so confined.






(e)
 Engaging in substantial gainful activity
(1)
 No benefit shall be payable under subsection (d)(1)(B)(ii), (d)(6)(A)(ii), (d)(6)(B), (e)(1)(B)(ii), or (f)(1)(B)(ii) of 
section 402 of this title
 or under subsection (a)(1) of this section to an individual for any month, after the third month, in which he engages in substantial gainful activity during the 36-month period following the end of his trial work period determined by application of 
section 422(c)(4)(A) of this title
.




(2)
 No benefit shall be payable under 
section 402 of this title
 on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual entitled to a benefit under subsection (a)(1) of this section for any month for which the benefit of such individual under subsection (a)(1) of this section is not payable under paragraph (1).




(f)
 Standard of review for termination of disability benefits
A recipient of benefits under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII of this chapter based on the disability of any individual may be determined not to be entitled to such benefits on the basis of a finding that the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are provided has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling only if such finding is supported by—
(1)
 substantial evidence which demonstrates that—
(A)
 there has been any medical improvement in the individual’s impairment or combination of impairments (other than medical improvement which is not related to the individual’s ability to work), and




(B)
 the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or






(2)
 substantial evidence which—
(A)
 consists of new medical evidence and a new assessment of the individual’s residual functional capacity, and demonstrates that—
(i)
 although the individual has not improved medically, he or she is nonetheless a beneficiary of advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology (related to the individual’s ability to work), and




(ii)
 the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity, or






(B)
 demonstrates that—
(i)
 although the individual has not improved medically, he or she has undergone vocational therapy (related to the individual’s ability to work), and




(ii)
 the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or








(3)
 substantial evidence which demonstrates that, as determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques or evaluations, the individual’s impairment or combination of impairments is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent prior decision that he or she was under a disability or continued to be under a disability, and that therefore the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or




(4)
 substantial evidence (which may be evidence on the record at the time any prior determination of the entitlement to benefits based on disability was made, or newly obtained evidence which relates to that determination) which demonstrates that a prior determination was in error.





Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to require a determination that a recipient of benefits under this subchapter or subchapter XVIII of this chapter based on an individual’s disability is entitled to such benefits if the prior determination was fraudulently obtained or if the individual is engaged in substantial gainful activity, cannot be located, or fails, without good cause, to cooperate in a review of the entitlement to such benefits or to follow prescribed treatment which would be expected to restore his or her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. In making for purposes of the preceding sentence any determination relating to fraudulent behavior by any individual or failure by any individual without good cause to cooperate or to take any required action, the Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation such individual may have (including any lack of facility with the English language). Any determination under this section shall be made on the basis of all the evidence available in the individual’s case file, including new evidence concerning the individual’s prior or current condition which is presented by the individual or secured by the Commissioner of Social Security. Any determination made under this section shall be made on the basis of the weight of the evidence and on a neutral basis with regard to the individual’s condition, without any initial inference as to the presence or absence of disability being drawn from the fact that the individual has previously been determined to be disabled. For purposes of this subsection, a benefit under this subchapter is based on an individual’s disability if it is a disability insurance benefit, a child’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefit based on disability, or a mother’s or father’s insurance benefit based on the disability of the mother’s or father’s child who has attained age 16.


(g)
 Continued payment of disability benefits during appeal
(1)
 In any case where—
(A)
 an individual is a recipient of disability insurance benefits, or of child’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefits based on disability,




(B)
 the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are payable is found to have ceased, not to have existed, or to no longer be disabling, and as a consequence such individual is determined not to be entitled to such benefits, and




(C)
 a timely request for a hearing under 
section 421(d) of this title
, or for an administrative review prior to such hearing, is pending with respect to the determination that he is not so entitled,





such individual may elect (in such manner and form and within such time as the Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulations prescribe) to have the payment of such benefits, the payment of any other benefits under this subchapter based on such individual’s wages and self-employment income, the payment of mother’s or father’s insurance benefits to such individual’s mother or father based on the disability of such individual as a child who has attained age 16, and the payment of benefits under subchapter XVIII of this chapter based on such individual’s disability, continued for an additional period beginning with the first month beginning after 
January 12, 1983
, for which (under such determination) such benefits are no longer otherwise payable, and ending with the earlier of (i) the month preceding the month in which a decision is made after such a hearing, or (ii) the month preceding the month in which no such request for a hearing or an administrative review is pending.




(2)
(A)
 If an individual elects to have the payment of his benefits continued for an additional period under paragraph (1), and the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security affirms the determination that he is not entitled to such benefits, any benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to such election (for months in such additional period) shall be considered overpayments for all purposes of this subchapter, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B).




(B)
 If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the individual’s appeal of his termination of benefits was made in good faith, all of the benefits paid pursuant to such individual’s election under paragraph (1) shall be subject to waiver consideration under the provisions of 
section 404 of this title
. In making for purposes of this subparagraph any determination of whether any individual’s appeal is made in good faith, the Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation such individual may have (including any lack of facility with the English language).






(h)
 Interim benefits in cases of delayed final decisions
(1)
 In any case in which an administrative law judge has determined after a hearing as provided under 
section 405(b) of this title
 that an individual is entitled to disability insurance benefits or child’s, widow’s, or widower’s insurance benefits based on disability and the Commissioner of Social Security has not issued the Commissioner’s final decision in such case within 110 days after the date of the administrative law judge’s determination, such benefits shall be currently paid for the months during the period beginning with the month preceding the month in which such 110-day period expires and ending with the month preceding the month in which such final decision is issued.




(2)
 For purposes of paragraph (1), in determining whether the 110-day period referred to in paragraph (1) has elapsed, any period of time for which the action or inaction of such individual or such individual’s representative without good cause results in the delay in the issuance of the Commissioner’s final decision shall not be taken into account to the extent that such period of time exceeds 20 calendar days.




(3)
 Any benefits currently paid under this subchapter pursuant to this subsection (for the months described in paragraph (1)) shall not be considered overpayments for any purpose of this subchapter (unless payment of such benefits was fraudulently obtained), and such benefits shall not be treated as past-due benefits for purposes of 
section 406(b)(1) of this title
.




(i)
 Reinstatement of entitlement
(1)

section 402 of this title
 on the basis of disability pursuant to an application filed therefor; and




(II)
 such entitlement terminated due to the performance of substantial gainful activity;






(ii)

(iii)
 the individual’s disability renders the individual unable to perform substantial gainful activity.






(C)
(i)
 Except as provided in clause (ii), the period prescribed in this subparagraph with respect to an individual is 60 consecutive months beginning with the month following the most recent month for which the individual was entitled to a benefit described in subparagraph (B)(i)(I) prior to the entitlement termination described in subparagraph (B)(i)(II).

(B)
(i)
 Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), the amount of the benefit payable for any month pursuant to the reinstatement of entitlement under this subsection shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter.




(ii)
 For purposes of computing the primary insurance amount of an individual whose entitlement to benefits under this section is reinstated under this subsection, the date of onset of the individual’s disability shall be the date of onset used in determining the individual’s most recent period of disability arising in connection with such benefits payable on the basis of an application.




(iii)
 Benefits under this section or 
section 402 of this title
 payable for any month pursuant to a request for reinstatement filed in accordance with paragraph (2) shall be reduced by the amount of any provisional benefit paid to such individual for such month under paragraph (7).

(D)
 The entitlement of any individual that is reinstated under this subsection shall end with the benefits payable for the month preceding whichever of the following months is the earliest:

The provisions of paragraph (4) shall apply to the reinstated entitlement of any such person to the same extent that they apply to the reinstated entitlement of such individual.




(6)

section 402 of this title
 pursuant to a reinstatement of entitlement under this subsection for 24 months (whether or not consecutive) shall, with respect to benefits so payable after such twenty-fourth month, be deemed for purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i)(I) and the determination, if appropriate, of the termination month in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section, or subsection (d)(1), (e)(1), or (f)(1) of

(j)
 Limitation on payments to prisoners
For provisions relating to limitation on payments to prisoners, see 
section 402(x) of this title
.




“(a)
 If an individual would (upon the timely filing of an application for a disability determination under section 216(i) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416(i)
] and of an application for disability insurance benefits under section 223 of such Act [
42 U.S.C. 423
]) have been entitled to disability insurance benefits under such section 223 for a period which began after 1959 and ended prior to 1964, such individual shall, upon filing application for disability insurance benefits under such section 223 with respect to such period not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this section [
Oct. 30, 1972
], be entitled, notwithstanding any other provision of title II of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.], to receive in a lump sum as disability insurance benefits payable under section 223, an amount equal to the total amounts of disability insurance benefits which would have been payable to him for such period if he had timely filed such an application for a disability determination and such an application for disability insurance benefits with respect to such period; but only if—
“(1)
 prior to the date of enactment of this section and after the date of enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 [
Jan. 2, 1968
] such period was determined (under section 216(i) of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 416(i)
]) to be a period of disability as to such individual; and




“(2)
 the application giving rise to the determination (under such section 216(i)) that such period is a period of disability as to such individual would not have been accepted as an application for such a determination except for the provisions of section 216(i)(2)(F).




“(b)
 No payment shall be made to any individual by reason of the provisions of subsection (a) except upon the basis of an application filed after the date of enactment of this section.”


 Repealed. 
 Reduction of disability benefits
(a)
 Conditions for reduction; computation
If for any month prior to the month in which an individual attains the age of 65—
(1)
 such individual is entitled to benefits under 
section 423 of this title
, and




(2)
 such individual is entitled for such month to—
(A)
 periodic benefits on account of his or her total or partial disability (whether or not permanent) under a workmen’s compensation law or plan of the United States or a State, or




(B)
 periodic benefits on account of his or her total or partial disability (whether or not permanent) under any other law or plan of the United States, a State, a political subdivision (as that term is used in 
section 418(b)(2) of this title
), or an instrumentality of two or more States (as that term is used in 
section 418(g) of this title
), other than (i) benefits payable under title 38, (ii) benefits payable under a program of assistance which is based on need, (iii) benefits based on service all or substantially all of which was included under an agreement entered into by a State and the Commissioner of Social Security under 
section 418 of this title
, and (iv) benefits under a law or plan of the United States based on service all or substantially all of which is employment as defined in 
section 410 of this title
,







the total of his benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 for such month and of any benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for such month based on his wages and self-employment income shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount by which the sum of—


(3)
 such total of benefits under sections 423 and 402 of this title for such month, and




(4)
 such periodic benefits payable (and actually paid) for such month to such individual under such laws or plans,





exceeds the higher of—


(5)
 80 per centum of his “average current earnings”, or




(6)
 the total of such individual’s disability insurance benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 for such month and of any monthly insurance benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for such month based on his wages and self-employment income, prior to reduction under this section.





In no case shall the reduction in the total of such benefits under sections 423 and 402 of this title for a month (in a continuous period of months) reduce such total below the sum of—


(7)
 the total of the benefits under sections 423 and 402 of this title, after reduction under this section, with respect to all persons entitled to benefits on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income for such month which were determined for such individual and such persons for the first month for which reduction under this section was made (or which would have been so determined if all of them had been so entitled in such first month), and




(8)
 any increase in such benefits with respect to such individual and such persons, before reduction under this section, which is made effective for months after the first month for which reduction under this section is made.





For purposes of clause (5), an individual’s average current earnings means the largest of (A) the average monthly wage (determined under 
section 415(b) of this title
 as in effect prior to January 1979) used for purposes of computing his benefits under 
section 423 of this title
, (B) one-sixtieth of the total of his wages and self-employment income (computed without regard to the limitations specified in sections 409(a)(1) and 411(b)(1) of this title) for the five consecutive calendar years after 1950 for which such wages and self-employment income were highest, or (C) one-twelfth of the total of his wages and self-employment income (computed without regard to the limitations specified in sections 409(a)(1) and 411(b)(1) of this title) for the calendar year in which he had the highest such wages and income during the period consisting of the calendar year in which he became disabled (as defined in 
section 423(d) of this title
) and the five years preceding that year.


(b)
 Reduction where benefits payable on other than monthly basis
If any periodic benefit for a total or partial disability under a law or plan described in subsection (a)(2) of this section is payable on other than a monthly basis (excluding a benefit payable as a lump sum except to the extent that it is a commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments), the reduction under this section shall be made at such time or times and in such amounts as the Commissioner of Social Security finds will approximate as nearly as practicable the reduction prescribed by subsection (a) of this section.




(c)
 Reductions and deductions under other provisions
Reduction of benefits under this section shall be made after any reduction under subsection (a) of 
section 403 of this title
, but before deductions under such section and under section 422(b)

 of this title.




(d)
 Exception
The reduction of benefits required by this section shall not be made if the law or plan described in subsection (a)(2) of this section under which a periodic benefit is payable provides for the reduction thereof when anyone is entitled to benefits under this subchapter on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of an individual entitled to benefits under 
section 423 of this title
, and such law or plan so provided on 
February 18, 1981
.




(e)
 Conditions for payment
If it appears to the Commissioner of Social Security that an individual may be eligible for periodic benefits under a law or plan which would give rise to reduction under this section, the Commissioner may require, as a condition of certification for payment of any benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 to any individual for any month and of any benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 for such month based on such individual’s wages and self-employment income, that such individual certify (i) whether he has filed or intends to file any claim for such periodic benefits, and (ii) if he has so filed, whether there has been a decision on such claim. The Commissioner of Social Security may, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, rely upon such a certification by such individual that he has not filed and does not intend to file such a claim, or that he has so filed and no final decision thereon has been made, in certifying benefits for payment pursuant to 
section 405(i) of this title
.




(f)
 Redetermination of reduction
(1)
 In the second calendar year after the year in which reduction under this section in the total of an individual’s benefits under 
section 423 of this title
 and any benefits under 
section 402 of this title
 based on his wages and self-employment income was first required (in a continuous period of months), and in each third year thereafter, the Commissioner of Social Security shall redetermine the amount of such benefits which are still subject to reduction under this section; but such redetermination shall not result in any decrease in the total amount of benefits payable under this subchapter on the basis of such individual’s wages and self-employment income. Such redetermined benefit shall be determined as of, and shall become effective with, the January following the year in which such redetermination was made.




(2)
 In making the redetermination required by paragraph (1), the individual’s average current earnings (as defined in subsection (a) of this section) shall be deemed to be the product of—
(A)
 his average current earnings as initially determined under subsection (a) of this section; and




(B)
 the ratio of (i) the national average wage index (as defined in 
section 409(k)(1) of this title
) for the calendar year before the year in which such redetermination is made to (ii) the national average wage index (as so defined) for the calendar year before the year in which the reduction was first computed (but not counting any reduction made in benefits for a previous period of disability).





Any amount determined under this paragraph which is not a multiple of $1 shall be reduced to the next lower multiple of $1.




(g)
 Proportionate reduction; application of excess
Whenever a reduction in the total of benefits for any month based on an individual’s wages and self-employment income is made under this section, each benefit, except the disability insurance benefit, shall first be proportionately decreased, and any excess of such reduction over the sum of all such benefits other than the disability insurance benefits shall then be applied to such disability insurance benefit.




(h)
 Furnishing of information
(1)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the head of any Federal agency shall provide such information within its possession as the Commissioner of Social Security may require for purposes of making a timely determination of the amount of the reduction, if any, required by this section in benefits payable under this subchapter, or verifying other information necessary in carrying out the provisions of this section.




(2)
 The Commissioner of Social Security is authorized to enter into agreements with States, political subdivisions, and other organizations that administer a law or plan subject to the provisions of this section, in order to obtain such information as the Commissioner may require to carry out the provisions of this section.




 Additional rules relating to benefits based on disability
(a)
 Suspension of benefits
If the Commissioner of Social Security, on the basis of information obtained by or submitted to the Commissioner, believes that an individual entitled to benefits under 
section 423 of this title
, or that a child who has attained the age of eighteen and is entitled to benefits under 
section 402(d) of this title
, or that a widow or surviving divorced wife who has not attained age 60 and is entitled to benefits under 
section 402(e) of this title
, or that a widower or surviving divorced husband who has not attained age 60 and is entitled to benefits under 
section 402(f) of this title
, may have ceased to be under a disability, the Commissioner of Social Security may suspend the payment of benefits under such section 402(d), 402(e), 402(f), or 423 of this title until it is determined (as provided in 
section 421 of this title
) whether or not such individual’s disability has ceased or until the Commissioner of Social Security believes that such disability has not ceased. In the case of any individual whose disability is subject to determination under an agreement with a State under 
section 421(b) of this title
, the Commissioner of Social Security shall promptly notify the appropriate State of the Commissioner’s action under this subsection and shall request a prompt determination of whether such individual’s disability has ceased. For purposes of this subsection, the term “disability” has the meaning assigned to such term in 
section 423(d) of this title
. Whenever the benefits of an individual entitled to a disability insurance benefit are suspended for any month, the benefits of any individual entitled thereto under subsection (b), (c), or (d) of 
section 402 of this title
, on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individual, shall be suspended for such month. The first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to any child entitled to benefits under 
section 402(d) of this title
, if he has attained the age of 18 but has not attained the age of 22, for any month during which he is a full-time student (as defined and determined under 
section 402(d) of this title
).




(b)
 Continued payments during rehabilitation program
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payment to an individual of benefits based on disability (as described in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section) shall not be terminated or suspended because the physical or mental impairment, on which the individual’s entitlement to such benefits is based, has or may have ceased, if—
(1)
 such individual is participating in a program consisting of the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program under 
section 1320b–19 of this title
 or another program of vocational rehabilitation services, employment services, or other support services approved by the Commissioner of Social Security, and




(2)
 the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the completion of such program, or its continuation for a specified period of time, will increase the likelihood that such individual may (following his participation in such program) be permanently removed from the disability benefit rolls.




 Entitlement to hospital insurance benefits
(a)
 Individuals over 65 years
Every individual who—
(1)
 has attained age 65, and




(2)
(A)
 is entitled to monthly insurance benefits under 
section 402 of this title
, would be entitled to those benefits except that he has not filed an application therefor (or application has not been made for a benefit the entitlement to which for any individual is a condition of entitlement therefor), or would be entitled to such benefits but for the failure of another individual, who meets all the criteria of entitlement to monthly insurance benefits, to meet such criteria throughout a month, and, in conformity with regulations of the Secretary, files an application for hospital insurance benefits under part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter,




(B)
 is a qualified railroad retirement beneficiary, or




(C)
(i)
 would meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) upon filing application for the monthly insurance benefits involved if medicare qualified government employment (as defined in

) were treated as employment (as defined in 
section 410(a) of this title
) for purposes of this subchapter, and (ii) files an application, in conformity with regulations of the Secretary, for hospital insurance benefits under part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter,









shall be entitled to hospital insurance benefits under part A of subchapter XVIII of this chapter for each month for which he meets the condition specified in paragraph (2), beginning with the first month after June 1966 for which he meets the conditions specified in paragraphs (1) and (2).


(b)
 Individuals under 65 years
Every individual who—
(1)
 has not attained age 65, and




(2)
(A)

section 423 of this title
 or (ii) child’s insurance benefits under 
section 402(d) of this title
 by reason of a disability (as defined in 
section 423(d) of this title
) or (iii) widow’s insurance benefits under 
section 402(e) of this title
 or widower’s insurance benefits under

(I)
 medicare qualified government employment (as defined in 
section 410(p) of this title
) were treated as employment (as defined in 
section 410(a) of this title
) for purposes of this subchapter, and

 Limited immunity for disbursing officers
A disbursing officer may not be held liable for any amount paid by the officer if the adjustment or recovery of the amount is waived under subsection (b) of this section, or adjustment under subsection (a) of this section is not completed before the death of the qualified individual against whose benefits deductions are authorized.

 To the account (in the Unemployment Trust Fund) of the State with respect to which employers paid such additional tax, an amount equal to the amount by which such additional tax received and covered into the Treasury exceeds that balance of advances, made under 
section 1321 of this title

(2)
 Transfers under this subsection shall be as of the beginning of the month succeeding the month in which the moneys were credited to the employment security administration account pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section.




(e)
 Revolving fund; appropriations; advances to Account; repayment; interest

(3)
 Advances to the employment security administration account made under this subsection shall bear interest until repaid at a rate equal to the average rate of interest (computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such advance) borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate.




(4)
 Advances to the employment security administration account made under this subsection, plus interest accrued thereon, shall be repaid by the transfer from time to time, from the employment security administration account to the revolving fund, of such amounts as the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, determines to be available in the employment security administration account for such repayment.

(1)
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall determine as of the close of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year ending 
June 30, 1961
) the excess in the employment security administration account.




(2)
 The excess in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year is the amount by which the net balance in such account as of such time (after the application of 
section 1102(b) of this title
 and paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection) exceeds the net balance in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of that fiscal year (including the fiscal year for which the excess is being computed) for which the net balance was higher than as of the beginning of any other such fiscal year.




(3)
(A)
 The excess determined as provided in paragraph (2) as of the close of any fiscal year after 
June 30, 1972
, shall be retained (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) in the employment security administration account until the amount in such account is equal to 40 percent of the amount of the total appropriation by the Congress out of the employment security administration account for the fiscal year for which the excess is determined. Three-eighths of the amount in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of any fiscal year after 
June 30, 1972
, or $150 million, whichever is the lesser, is authorized to be made available for such fiscal year pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section for additional costs of administration due to an increase in the rate of insured unemployment for a calendar quarter of at least 15 percent over the rate of insured unemployment for the corresponding calendar quarter in the immediately preceding year.




(B)
 If the entire amount of the excess determined as provided in paragraph (2) as of the close of any fiscal year after 
June 30, 1972
, is not retained in the employment security administration account, there shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the extended unemployment compensation account the balance of such excess or so much thereof as is required to increase the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account to the limit provided in 
section 1105(b)(2) of this title
.




(C)
 If as of the close of any fiscal year after 
June 30, 1972
, the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account exceeds the limit provided in 
section 1105(b)(2) of this title
, such excess shall be transferred to the employment security administration account as of the close of such fiscal year.






(4)
 For the purposes of this section, the net balance in the employment security administration account as of any time is the amount in such account as of such time reduced by the sum of—
(A)
 the amounts then subject to transfer pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and




(B)
 the balance of advances (plus interest accrued thereon) then repayable to the revolving fund established by subsection (e) of this section.





The net balance in the employment security administration account as of the beginning of any fiscal year shall be determined after the disposition of the excess in such account as of the close of the preceding fiscal year.

 Determination of excess; amount transferred
Whenever the Secretary of the Treasury determines pursuant to 
section 1101(f) of this title

section 1101(f)(3) of this title

 the amount (determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by him to the Secretary of the Treasury) equal to 0.5 percent of the total wages subject (determined without any limitation on amount) to contributions under all State unemployment compensation laws for the calendar year ending during the fiscal year for which the excess is determined.




(b)
 Unemployment account excesses
The amount, if any, by which the amount in the Federal unemployment account as of the close of any fiscal year exceeds the greater of the amounts specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall be transferred to the employment security administration account as of the close of such fiscal year.




(c)
 Report to Congress
Whenever the Secretary of Labor has reason to believe that in the next fiscal year the employment security administration account will reach the limit provided for such account in 
section 1101(f)(3)(A) of this title
, and the Federal unemployment account will reach the limit provided for such account in subsection (a) of this section, and the extended unemployment compensation account will reach the limit provided for such account in 
section 1105(b)(2) of this title
, he shall, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, so report to the Congress with a recommendation for appropriate action by the Congress.

section 1105(b)(2) of this title
 and the amount in the Federal unemployment account has reached the limit provided in 
section 1102(a) of this title
 and all advances and interest pursuant to 
section 1105(d) of this title

section 1101(f)(3)(A) of this title
, such excess amount, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the accounts of the States in the Unemployment Trust Fund.




(2)
 Each State’s share of the funds to be transferred under this subsection as of any October 1—
(A)
 shall be determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by such Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury before such date, and




(B)
 shall bear the same ratio to the total amount to be so transferred as—
(i)
 the amount of wages subject to tax under section 3301 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 during the preceding calendar year which are determined by the Secretary of Labor to be attributable to the State, bears to




(ii)
 the total amount of wages subject to such tax during such year.








(b)
 Transfer of funds where State is ineligible
(1)
 If the Secretary of Labor finds that on October 1 of any fiscal year—
(A)
 a State is not eligible for certification under 
section 503 of this title
, or




(B)
 the law of a State is not approvable under section 3304 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [
26 U.S.C. 3304
],





then the amount available for transfer to such State’s account shall, in lieu of being so transferred, be transferred to the Federal unemployment account as of the beginning of such October 1. If, during the fiscal year beginning on such October 1, the Secretary of Labor finds and certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury that such State is eligible for certification under 
section 503 of this title
, that the law of such State is approvable under such section 3304, or both, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer such amount from the Federal unemployment account to the account of such State. If the Secretary of Labor does not so find and certify to the Secretary of the Treasury before the close of such fiscal year then the amount which was available for transfer to such State’s account as of October 1 of such fiscal year shall (as of the close of such fiscal year) become unrestricted as to use as part of the Federal unemployment account.




(2)
 The amount which, but for this paragraph, would be transferred to the account of a State under subsection (a) of this section or paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the balance of advances made to the State under 
section 1321 of this title
. The sum by which such amount is reduced shall—
(A)
 be transferred to or retained in (as the case may be) the Federal unemployment account, and




(B)
 be credited against, and operate to reduce—
(i)
 first, any balance of advances made before 
September 13, 1960
, to the State under 
section 1321 of this title
, and




(ii)
 second, any balance of advances made on or after 
September 13, 1960

section 1321 of this title
.

(2)
 A State may, pursuant to a specific appropriation made by the legislative body of the State, use money withdrawn from its account in the payment of expenses incurred by it for the administration of its unemployment compensation law and public employment offices if and only if—
(A)
 the purposes and amounts were specified in the law making the appropriation,

(II)
 the aggregate of the amounts used by the State pursuant to this subsection and charged against the amounts transferred to the account of such State, and

 for purposes of clause (i), amounts used by a State for administration shall be chargeable against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into, and

 amounts transferred to the account of a State pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section were used in payment of unemployment benefits to individuals; and




(ii)
 the Governor of such State submits a request to the Secretary of Labor that such amounts be restored under this paragraph,





then the amounts described in clause (i) shall be restored to the status of funds transferred under subsections (a) and (b) of this section which have not been used by eliminating any charge against amounts so transferred for the use of such amounts in the payment of unemployment benefits.




(B)
 Subparagraph (A) shall apply only to the extent that the amounts described in clause (i) of such subparagraph do not exceed the amount then in the State’s account.

(D)
 If the Secretary of Labor determines that the requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to any request, the Secretary shall notify the Governor of the State that such requirements are met with respect to such request and the amount restored under this paragraph.

(3)
 The State law of a State meets the requirements of this paragraph if such State law includes provisions to carry out at least 2 of the following subparagraphs:
(A)
 An individual shall not be denied regular unemployment compensation under any State law provisions relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to accept work, solely because such individual is seeking only part-time work (as defined by the Secretary of Labor), except that the State law provisions carrying out this subparagraph may exclude an individual if a majority of the weeks of work in such individual’s base period do not include part-time work (as so defined).




(B)
 An individual shall not be disqualified from regular unemployment compensation for separating from employment if that separation is for any compelling family reason. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “compelling family reason” means the following:
(i)
 One or both of the following offenses as selected by the State, but in making such selection, the resulting change in the State law shall not supercede any other provision of law relating to unemployment insurance to the extent that such other provision provides broader access to unemployment benefits for victims of such selected offense or offenses:

(ii)
 Each State-approved training program or job training program referred to in clause (i) shall prepare individuals who have been separated from a declining occupation, or who have been involuntarily and indefinitely separated from employment as a result of a permanent reduction of operations at the individual’s place of employment, for entry into a high-demand occupation.

 Dependents’ allowances are provided, in the case of any individual who is entitled to receive regular unemployment compensation and who has any dependents (as defined by State law), in an amount equal to at least $15 per dependent per week, subject to any aggregate limitation on such allowances which the State law may establish (but which aggregate limitation on the total allowance for dependents paid to an individual may not be less than $50 for each week of unemployment or 50 percent of the individual’s weekly benefit amount for the benefit year, whichever is less), except that a State law may provide for a reasonable reduction in the amount of any such allowance for a week of less than total unemployment.






(4)
(A)
 Any State seeking an incentive payment under this subsection shall submit an application therefor at such time, in such manner, and complete with such information as the Secretary of Labor may within 60 days after

(B)
(i)
 If the Secretary of Labor finds that the State law provisions (disregarding any State law provisions which are not then currently in effect as permanent law or which are subject to discontinuation) meet the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), as the case may be, the Secretary of Labor shall thereupon make a certification to that effect to the Secretary of the Treasury, together with a certification as to the amount of the incentive payment to be transferred to the State account pursuant to that finding.

 Unemployment Trust Fund
(a)
 Establishment
There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the “Unemployment Trust Fund”, hereinafter in this subchapter called the “Fund”. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive and hold in the Fund all moneys deposited therein by a State agency from a State unemployment fund, or by the Railroad Retirement Board to the credit of the railroad unemployment insurance account or the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund, or otherwise deposited in or credited to the Fund or any account therein. Such deposit may be made directly with the Secretary of the Treasury, with any depositary designated by him for such purpose, or with any Federal Reserve Bank.




(b)
 Investments
It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest such portion of the Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investment may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the Fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming part of the public debt; except that where such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum next lower than such average rate. Obligations other than such special obligations may be acquired for the Fund only on such terms as to provide an investment yield not less than the yield which would be required in the case of special obligations if issued to the Fund upon the date of such acquisition. Advances made to the Federal unemployment account pursuant to 
section 1323 of this title
 shall not be invested.




(c)
 Sale or redemption of obligations
Any obligations acquired by the Fund (except special obligations issued exclusively to the Fund) may be sold at the market price, and such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.




(d)
 Treatment of interest and proceeds
The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Fund.




(e)
 Separate book accounts
The Fund shall be invested as a single fund, but the Secretary of the Treasury shall maintain a separate book account for each State agency, the employment security administration account, the Federal unemployment account, the railroad unemployment insurance account, and the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund and shall credit quarterly (on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each year) to each account, on the basis of the average daily balance of such account, a proportionate part of the earnings of the Fund for the quarter ending on such date. For the purpose of this subsection, the average daily balance shall be computed—
(1)
 in the case of any State account, by reducing (but not below zero) the amount in the account by the balance of advances made to the State under 
section 1321 of this title
, and




(2)
 in the case of the Federal unemployment account—
(A)
 by adding to the amount in the account the aggregate of the reductions under paragraph (1), and




(B)
 by subtracting from the sum so obtained the balance of advances made under 
section 1323 of this title
 to the account.






(f)
 Payment to State agencies and Railroad Retirement Board
The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay out of the Fund to any State agency such amount as it may duly requisition, not exceeding the amount standing to the account of such State agency at the time of such payment. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to make such payments out of the railroad unemployment insurance account for the payment of benefits, and out of the railroad unemployment insurance administration fund for the payment of administrative expenses, as the Railroad Retirement Board may duly certify, not exceeding the amount standing to the credit of such account or such fund, as the case may be, at the time of such payment.




(g)
 Federal unemployment account; establishment
There is hereby established in the Unemployment Trust Fund a Federal unemployment account.




 Extended unemployment compensation account
(a)

section 1104(e) of this title
, such account shall be maintained as a separate book account.




(b)
 Transfers to account
(1)
 Except as provided in paragraph (3), the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer (as of the close of each month) from the employment security administration account to the extended unemployment compensation account established by subsection (a) of this section, an amount (determined by such Secretary) equal to 20 percent of the amount by which—
(A)
 the transfers to the employment security administration account pursuant to 
section 1101(b)(2) of this title
 during such month, exceed




(B)
 the payments during such month from the employment security administration account pursuant to section 1101(b)(3) and (d) of this title.





If for any such month the payments referred to in subparagraph (B) exceed the transfers referred to in subparagraph (A), proper adjustments shall be made in the amounts subsequently transferred.




(2)
 Whenever the Secretary of the Treasury determines pursuant to 
section 1101(f) of this title
 that there is an excess in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year beginning after 
June 30, 1972
, there shall be transferred (as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year) to the extended unemployment compensation account the total amount of such excess or so much thereof as is required to increase the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account to whichever of the following is the greater:
(A)
 $750,000,000, or




(B)
 the amount (determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by him to the Secretary of the Treasury) equal to 0.5 percent of the total wages subject (determined without any limitation on amount) to contributions under all State unemployment compensation laws for the calendar year ending during the fiscal year for which the excess is determined.






(3)
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall make no transfer pursuant to paragraph (1) as of the close of any month if he determines that the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account is equal to (or in excess of) the limitation provided in paragraph (2).




(c)
 Transfers to State accounts
Amounts in the extended unemployment compensation account shall be available for transfer to the accounts of the States in the Unemployment Trust Fund as provided in section 204(e) of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970.




(d)
 Advances to account; repayment
There are hereby authorized to be appropriated, without fiscal year limitation, to the extended unemployment compensation account, as repayable advances, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. Amounts appropriated as repayable advances shall be repaid by transfers from the extended unemployment compensation account to the general fund of the Treasury, at such times as the amount in the extended unemployment compensation account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to be adequate for such purpose. Repayments under the preceding sentence shall be made whenever the Secretary of the Treasury (after consultation with the Secretary of Labor) determines that the amount then in the account exceeds the amount necessary to meet the anticipated payments from the account during the next 3 months. Any amount transferred as a repayment under this subsection shall be credited against, and shall operate to reduce, any balance of advances repayable under this subsection. Amounts appropriated as repayable advances for purposes of this subsection shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such advance, borne by all interest bearing obligations of the United States then forming part of the public debt; except that in cases in which such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent next lower than such average rate.

 (7) provide that no aid will be furnished any individual under the plan with respect to any period with respect to which he is receiving old-age assistance under the State plan approved under 
section 302 of this title
 or assistance under a State program funded under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter; (8) provide that the State agency shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of the individual claiming aid to the blind, as well as any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income, except that, in making such determination, the State agency (A) shall disregard the first $85 per month of earned income, plus one-half of earned income in excess of $85 per month, (B) shall, for a period not in excess of twelve months, and may, for a period not in excess of thirty-six months, disregard such additional amounts of other income and resources, in the case of an individual who has a plan for achieving self-support approved by the State agency, as may be necessary for the fulfillment of such plan, and (C) may, before disregarding the amounts referred to in clauses (A) and (B), disregard not more than $7.50 of any income; (9) provide safeguards which permit the use or disclosure of information concerning applicants or recipients only (A) to public officials who require such information in connection with their official duties, or (B) to other persons for purposes directly connected with the administration of the State plan; (10) provide that, in determining whether an individual is blind, there shall be an examination by a physician skilled in diseases of the eye or by an optometrist, whichever the individual may select; (11) effective

 Any residence requirement which excludes any resident of the State who has resided therein five years during the nine years immediately preceding the application for aid and has resided therein continuously for one year immediately preceding the application; or




(2)
 Any citizenship requirement which excludes any citizen of the United States.





At the option of the State, the plan may provide that manuals and other policy issuances will be furnished to persons without charge for the reasonable cost of such materials, but such provision shall not be required by the Secretary as a condition for the approval of such plan under this subchapter.

section 1203 of this title
 shall be made, in the case of any such plan, only with respect to expenditures thereunder which would be included as expenditures for the purposes of 
section 1203 of this title
 under a plan approved under this section without regard to the provisions of this sentence.

Provided
, That any part of the amount recovered from the estate of a deceased recipient which is not in excess of the amount expended by the State or any political subdivision thereof for the funeral expenses of the deceased shall not be considered as a basis for reduction under clause (B) of this paragraph.




(3)
 The Secretary of the Treasury shall thereupon, through the Fiscal Service of the Treasury Department, and prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, pay to the State, at the time or times fixed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the amount so certified.

 certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the amount (not greater than the amount estimated by the Governor of the State) determined under subparagraph (A).





The aggregate of the amounts certified by the Secretary of Labor with respect to any 3-month period shall not exceed the amount which the Secretary of the Treasury reports to the Secretary of Labor is available in the Federal unemployment account for advances with respect to each month of such 3-month period.




(3)
 For purposes of this subsection—

 the term “compensation” means cash benefits payable to individuals with respect to their unemployment, exclusive of expenses of administration.






(b)

section 1103(b)(1) of this title
). The amount of any monthly installment so transferred shall not exceed the amount estimated by the State to be required for the payment of compensation for the month with respect to which such installment is made.


 Repayment by State; certification; transfer; interest on loan; credit of interest on loan
(a)
 Repayment by State; certification; transfer
The Governor of any State may at any time request that funds be transferred from the account of such State to the Federal unemployment account in repayment of part or all of that balance of advances, made to such State under 
section 1321 of this title
, specified in the request. The Secretary of Labor shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the amount and balance specified in the request; and the Secretary of the Treasury shall promptly transfer such amount in reduction of such balance.




(b)
 Interest on loan
(1)
 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, each State shall pay interest on any advance made to such State under 
section 1321 of this title
. Interest so payable with respect to periods during any calendar year shall be at the rate determined under paragraph (4) for such calendar year.




(2)
 No interest shall be required to be paid under paragraph (1) with respect to any advance or advances made during any calendar year if—
(A)
 such advances are repaid in full before the close of September 30 of the calendar year in which the advances were made,




(B)
 no other advance was made to such State under 
section 1321 of this title
 during such calendar year and after the date on which the repayment of the advances was completed, and




(C)
 such State meets funding goals, established under regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor, relating to the accounts of the States in the Unemployment Trust Fund.






(3)
(A)
 Interest payable under paragraph (1) which was attributable to periods during any fiscal year shall be paid by the State to the Secretary of the Treasury prior to the first day of the following fiscal year. If interest is payable under paragraph (1) on any advance (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the “first advance”) by reason of another advance made to such State after September 30 of the calendar year in which the first advance was made, interest on such first advance attributable to periods before such September 30 shall be paid not later than the day after the date on which the other advance was made.




(B)
 Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in the case of any advance made during the last 5 months of any fiscal year, interest on such advance attributable to periods during such fiscal year shall not be required to be paid before the last day of the succeeding taxable year. Any interest the time for payment of which is deferred by the preceding sentence shall bear interest in the same manner as if it were an advance made on the day on which it would have been required to be paid but for this subparagraph.




(C)
(i)
 In the case of any State which meets the requirements of clause (ii) for any calendar year, any interest otherwise required to be paid under this subsection during such calendar year shall be paid as follows—
(I)
 25 percent of the amount otherwise required to be paid on or before any day during such calendar year shall be paid on or before such day; and




(II)
 25 percent of the amount otherwise required to be paid on or before such day shall be paid on or before the corresponding day in each of the 3 succeeding calendar years.





No interest shall accrue on such deferred interest.




(ii)
 A State meets the requirements of this clause for any calendar year if the rate of insured unemployment (as determined for purposes of section 203 of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970) under the State law of the period consisting of the first 6 months of the preceding calendar year equaled or exceeded 7.5 percent.








(4)
 The interest rate determined under this paragraph with respect to any calendar year is a percentage (but not in excess of 10 percent) determined by dividing—
(A)
 the aggregate amount credited under 
section 1104(e) of this title
 to State accounts on the last day of the last calendar quarter of the immediately preceding calendar year, by




(B)
 the aggregate of the average daily balances of the State accounts for such quarter as determined under 
section 1104(e) of this title
.






(5)
 Interest required to be paid under paragraph (1) shall not be paid (directly or indirectly) by a State from amounts in its unemployment fund. If the Secretary of Labor determines that any State action results in the paying of such interest directly or indirectly (by an equivalent reduction in State unemployment taxes or otherwise) from such unemployment fund, the Secretary of Labor shall not certify such State’s unemployment compensation law under section 3304 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Such noncertification shall be made in accordance with section 3304(c) of such Code.




(6)
(A)
 For purposes of paragraph (2), any voluntary repayment shall be applied against advances made under 
section 1321 of this title
 on the last made first repaid basis. Any other repayment of such an advance shall be applied against advances on a first made first repaid basis.




(B)
 For purposes of this paragraph, the term “voluntary repayment” means any repayment made under subsection (a) of this section.






(7)
 This subsection shall only apply to advances made on or after 
April 1, 1982
.




(8)
(A)
 With respect to interest due under this section on September 30 of 1983, 1984, or 1985 (other than interest previously deferred under paragraph (3)(C)), a State may pay 80 percent of such interest in four annual installments of at least 20 percent beginning with the year after the year in which it is otherwise due, if such State meets the criteria of subparagraph (B). No interest shall accrue on such deferred interest.




(B)
 To meet the criteria of this subparagraph a State must—
(i)
 have taken no action since 
October 1, 1982
, which would reduce its net unemployment tax effort or the net solvency of its unemployment system (as determined for purposes of section 3302(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986); and




(ii)
(I)
 have taken an action (as certified by the Secretary of Labor) after 
March 31, 1982
, which would have increased revenue liabilities and decreased benefits under the State’s unemployment compensation system (hereinafter referred to as a “solvency effort”) by a combined total of the applicable percentage (as compared to such revenues and benefits as would have been in effect without such State action) for the calendar year for which the deferral is requested; or




(II)
 have had, for taxable year 1982, an average unemployment tax rate which was equal to or greater than 2.0 percent of the total of the wages (as determined without any limitation on amount) attributable to such State subject to contribution under the State unemployment compensation law with respect to such taxable year.







In the case of the first year for which there is a deferral (over a 4-year period) of the interest otherwise payable for such year, the applicable percentage shall be 25 percent. In the case of the second such year, the applicable percentage shall be 35 percent. In the case of the third such year, the applicable percentage shall be 50 percent.




(C)
(i)
 The base year is the first year for which deferral under this provision is requested and subsequently granted. The Secretary of Labor shall estimate the unemployment rate for the base year. To determine whether a State meets the requirements of subparagraph (B)(ii)(I), the Secretary of Labor shall determine the percentage by which the benefits and taxes in the base year with the application of the action referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii)(I) are lower or greater, as the case may be, than such benefits and taxes would have been without the application of such action. In making this determination, the Secretary shall deem the application of the action referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii)(I) to have been effective for the base year to the same extent as such action is effective for the year following the year for which the deferral is sought. Once a deferral is approved under clause (ii)(I) of subparagraph (B) a State must continue to maintain its solvency effort. Failure to do so shall result in the State being required to make immediate payment of all deferred interest.




(ii)
 Increases in the taxable wage base from $6,000 to $7,000 or increases after 1984 in the maximum tax rate to 5.4 percent shall not be counted for purposes of meeting the requirement of subparagraph (B).






(D)
 In the case of a State which produces a solvency effort of 50 percent, 80 percent, and 90 percent rather than the 25 percent, 35 percent, and 50 percent required under subparagraph (B), the interest shall be computed at an interest rate which is 1 percentage point less than the otherwise applicable interest rate.






(9)
 Any interest otherwise due from a State on September 30 of a calendar year after 1982 may be deferred (and no interest shall accrue on such deferred interest) for a grace period of not to exceed 9 months if, for the most recent 12-month period for which data are available before the date such interest is otherwise due, the State had an average total unemployment rate of 13.5 percent or greater.




(10)
(A)
 With respect to the period beginning on 
February 17, 2009
, and ending on 
December 31, 2010
—
(i)
 any interest payment otherwise due from a State under this subsection during such period shall be deemed to have been made by the State; and




(ii)
 no interest shall accrue during such period on any advance or advances made under 
section 1321 of this title
 to a State.






(B)
 The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall have no effect on the requirement for interest payments under this subsection after the period described in such subparagraph or on the accrual of interest under this subsection after such period.






(c)
 Credit of interest on loan
Interest paid by States in accordance with this section shall be credited to the Federal unemployment account established by 
section 1104(g) of this title
 in the Unemployment Trust Fund.




 Repayable advances to Federal unemployment account
There are hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Federal unemployment account, as repayable advances, such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Amounts appropriated as repayable advances shall be repaid by transfers from the Federal unemployment account to the general fund of the Treasury, at such times as the amount in the Federal unemployment account is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, to be adequate for such purpose. Any amount transferred as a repayment under this section shall be credited against, and shall operate to reduce, any balance of advances repayable under this section. Whenever, after the application of sections 1101(f)(3) and 1102(a) of this title with respect to the excess in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year, there remains any portion of such excess, so much of such remainder as does not exceed the balance of advances made pursuant to this section shall be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury and shall be credited against, and shall operate to reduce, such balance of advances. Amounts appropriated as repayable advances for purposes of this subsection shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such advance, borne by all interest bearing obligations of the United States then forming part of the public debt; except that in cases in which such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent, the rate of interest shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 percent next lower than such average rate.
 “Governor” defined
When used in this subchapter, the term “Governor” includes the Mayor of the District of Columbia.

section 1202 of this title
; (8) provide that the State agency shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of an individual claiming aid to the permanently and totally disabled, as well as any expenses reasonably attributable to the earning of any such income; except that, in making such determination, (A) the State agency may disregard not more than $7.50 of any income, (B) of the first $80 per month of additional income which is earned the State agency may disregard not more than the first $20 thereof plus one-half of the remainder, and (C) the State agency may, for a period not in excess of 36 months, disregard such additional amounts of other income and resources, in the case of an individual who has a plan for achieving self-support approved by the State agency, as may be necessary for the fulfillment of such plan, but only with respect to the part or parts of such period during substantially all of which he is actually undergoing vocational rehabilitation; (9) provide safeguards which permit the use or disclosure of information concerning applicants or recipients only (A) to public officials who require such information in connection with their official duties, or (B) to other persons for purposes directly connected with the administration of the State plan; (10) provide that all individuals wishing to make application for aid to the permanently and totally disabled shall have opportunity to do so, and that aid to the permanently and totally disabled shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals; (11) effective 
July 1, 1953
, provide, if the plan includes payments to individuals in private or public institutions, for the establishment or designation of a State authority or authorities which shall be responsible for establishing and maintaining standards for such institutions; (12) provide a description of the services (if any) which the State agency makes available (using whatever internal organizational arrangement it finds appropriate for this purpose) to applicants for and recipients of aid to the permanently and totally disabled to help them attain self-support or self-care, including a description of the steps taken to assure, in the provision of such services, maximum utilization of other agencies providing similar or related services; and (13) provide that information is requested and exchanged for purposes of income and eligibility verification in accordance with a State system which meets the requirements of

(2)
 Any citizenship requirement which excludes any citizen of the United States.





At the option of the State, the plan may provide that manuals and other policy issuances will be furnished to persons without charge for the reasonable cost of such materials, but such provision shall not be required by the Secretary as a condition for the approval of such plan under this subchapter.

 to determine whether, and if so which, changes in methods of payment or reimbursement (other than those dealt with in section 222(a) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972) for health care and services under health programs established by this chapter, including a change to methods based on negotiated rates, would have the effect of increasing the efficiency and economy of health services under such programs through the creation of additional incentives to these ends without adversely affecting the quality of such services;




(B)
 to determine whether payments for services other than those for which payment may be made under such programs (and which are incidental to services for which payment may be made under such programs) would, in the judgment of the Secretary, result in more economical provision and more effective utilization of services for which payment may be made under such program, where such services are furnished by organizations and institutions which have the capability of providing—
(i)
 comprehensive health care services,




(ii)
 mental health care services (as defined by section 2691(c)

 of this title),




(iii)
 ambulatory health care services (including surgical services provided on an outpatient basis), or




(iv)
 institutional services which may substitute, at lower cost, for hospital care;






(C)
 to determine whether the rates of payment or reimbursement for health care services, approved by a State for purposes of the administration of one or more of its laws, when utilized to determine the amount to be paid for services furnished in such State under the health programs established by this chapter, would have the effect of reducing the costs of such programs without adversely affecting the quality of such services;




(D)
 to determine whether payments under such programs based on a single combined rate of reimbursement or charge for the teaching activities and patient care which residents, interns, and supervising physicians render in connection with a graduate medical education program in a patient facility would result in more equitable and economical patient care arrangements without adversely affecting the quality of such care;




(E)
 to determine whether coverage of intermediate care facility services and homemaker services would provide suitable alternatives to posthospital benefits presently provided under this subchapter; such experiment and demonstration projects may include:
(i)
 counting each day of care in an intermediate care facility as one day of care in a skilled nursing facility, if such care was for a condition for which the individual was hospitalized,




(ii)
 covering the services of homemakers for a maximum of 21 days, if institutional services are not medically appropriate,




(iii)
 determining whether such coverage would reduce long-range costs by reducing the lengths of stay in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities, and




(iv)
 establishing alternative eligibility requirements and determining the probable cost of applying each alternative, if the project suggests that such extension of coverage would be desirable;






(F)
 to determine whether, and if so which type of, fixed price or performance incentive contract would have the effect of inducing to the greatest degree effective, efficient, and economical performance of agencies and organizations making payment under agreements or contracts with the Secretary for health care and services under health programs established by this chapter;




(G)
 to determine under what circumstances payment for services would be appropriate and the most appropriate, equitable, and noninflationary methods and amounts of reimbursement under health care programs established by this chapter for services, which are performed independently by an assistant to a physician, including a nurse practitioner (whether or not performed in the office of or at a place at which such physician is physically present), and—
(i)
 which such assistant is legally authorized to perform by the State or political subdivision wherein such services are performed, and




(ii)
 for which such physician assumes full legal and ethical responsibility as to the necessity, propriety, and quality thereof;






(H)
 to establish an experimental program to provide day-care services, which consist of such personal care, supervision, and services as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe, for individuals eligible to enroll in the supplemental medical insurance program established under part B of this subchapter and subchapter XIX of this chapter, in day-care centers which meet such standards as the Secretary shall by regulation establish;




(I)
 to determine whether the services of clinical psychologists may be made more generally available to persons eligible for services under this subchapter and subchapter XIX of this chapter in a manner consistent with quality of care and equitable and efficient administration;




(J)
 to develop or demonstrate improved methods for the investigation and prosecution of fraud in the provision of care or services under the health programs established by this chapter; and




(K)
 to determine whether the use of competitive bidding in the awarding of contracts, or the use of other methods of reimbursement, under part B of subchapter XI of this chapter would be efficient and effective methods of furthering the purposes of that part.





For purposes of this subsection, “health programs established by this chapter” means the program established by this subchapter and a program established by a plan of a State approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter.




(2)
 Grants, payments under contracts, and other expenditures made for experiments and demonstration projects under paragraph (1) shall be made in appropriate part from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (established by 
section 1395i of this title
) and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (established by 
section 1395t of this title
) and from funds appropriated under subchapter XIX of this chapter. Grants and payments under contracts may be made either in advance or by way of reimbursement, as may be determined by the Secretary, and shall be made in such installments and on such conditions as the Secretary finds necessary to carry out the purpose of this section. With respect to any such grant, payment, or other expenditure, the amount to be paid from each of such trust funds (and from funds appropriated under such subchapter XIX of this chapter) shall be determined by the Secretary, giving due regard to the purposes of the experiment or project involved.




(b)
 Waiver of certain payment or reimbursement requirements; advice and recommendations of specialists preceding experiments and demonstration projects
In the case of any experiment or demonstration project under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may waive compliance with the requirements of this subchapter and subchapter XIX of this chapter insofar as such requirements relate to reimbursement or payment on the basis of reasonable cost, or (in the case of physicians) on the basis of reasonable charge, or to reimbursement or payment only for such services or items as may be specified in the experiment; and costs incurred in such experiment or demonstration project in excess of the costs which would otherwise be reimbursed or paid under such subchapters may be reimbursed or paid to the extent that such waiver applies to them (with such excess being borne by the Secretary). No experiment or demonstration project shall be engaged in or developed under subsection (a) of this section until the Secretary obtains the advice and recommendations of specialists who are competent to evaluate the proposed experiment or demonstration project as to the soundness of its objectives, the possibilities of securing productive results, the adequacy of resources to conduct the proposed experiment or demonstration project, and its relationship to other similar experiments and projects already completed or in process.

 (relating to screen and enroll).




(IV)

.—
In making such a determination, the State shall use procedures that, to the maximum feasible extent, reduce the burden imposed on the individual of such determination.

(d)
 Estimates of State entitlement; installments; adjustments to reflect overpayments or underpayments; time for recovery or adjustment; uncollectable or discharged debts; obligated appropriations; disputed claims
(1)
 Prior to the beginning of each quarter, the Secretary shall estimate the amount to which a State will be entitled under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for such quarter, such estimates to be based on (A) a report filed by the State containing its estimate of the total sum to be expended in such quarter in accordance with the provisions of such subsections, and stating the amount appropriated or made available by the State and its political subdivisions for such expenditures in such quarter, and if such amount is less than the State’s proportionate share of the total sum of such estimated expenditures, the source or sources from which the difference is expected to be derived, and (B) such other investigation as the Secretary may find necessary.




(2)
(A)
 The Secretary shall then pay to the State, in such installments as he may determine, the amount so estimated, reduced or increased to the extent of any overpayment or underpayment which the Secretary determines was made under this section to such State for any prior quarter and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection.




(B)
 Expenditures for which payments were made to the State under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as an overpayment to the extent that the State or local agency administering such plan has been reimbursed for such expenditures by a third party pursuant to the provisions of its plan in compliance with 
section 1396a(a)(25) of this title
.




(C)
 For purposes of this subsection, when an overpayment is discovered, which was made by a State to a person or other entity, the State shall have a period of 1 year in which to recover or attempt to recover such overpayment before adjustment is made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (D), the adjustment in the Federal payment shall be made at the end of the 1-year period, whether or not recovery was made.




(D)
(i)
 In any case where the State is unable to recover a debt which represents an overpayment (or any portion thereof) made to a person or other entity on account of such debt having been discharged in bankruptcy or otherwise being uncollectable, no adjustment shall be made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment (or portion thereof).




(ii)
 In any case where the State is unable to recover a debt which represents an overpayment (or any portion thereof) made to a person or other entity due to fraud within 1 year of discovery because there is not a final determination of the amount of the overpayment under an administrative or judicial process (as applicable), including as a result of a judgment being under appeal, no adjustment shall be made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment (or portion thereof) before the date that is 30 days after the date on which a final judgment (including, if applicable, a final determination on an appeal) is made.








(3)
(A)
 The pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to medical assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.




(B)
(i)
 Subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of the comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between manufacturers of tobacco products, as defined in section 5702(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and State Attorneys General, or as part of any individual State settlement or judgment reached in litigation initiated or pursued by a State against one or more such manufacturers.




(ii)
 Except as provided in subsection (i)(19) of this section, a State may use amounts recovered or paid to the State as part of a comprehensive or individual settlement, or a judgment, described in clause (i) for any expenditures determined appropriate by the State.








(4)
 Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under this subsection, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.




(5)
 In any case in which the Secretary estimates that there has been an overpayment under this section to a State on the basis of a claim by such State that has been disallowed by the Secretary under 
section 1316(d) of this title
, and such State disputes such disallowance, the amount of the Federal payment in controversy shall, at the option of the State, be retained by such State or recovered by the Secretary pending a final determination with respect to such payment amount. If such final determination is to the effect that any amount was properly disallowed, and the State chose to retain payment of the amount in controversy, the Secretary shall offset, from any subsequent payments made to such State under this subchapter, an amount equal to the proper amount of the disallowance plus interest on such amount disallowed for the period beginning on the date such amount was disallowed and ending on the date of such final determination at a rate (determined by the Secretary) based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day treasury bill auction rates during such period.




(6)
(A)
 Each State (as defined in subsection (w)(7)(D) of this section) shall include, in the first report submitted under paragraph (1) after the end of each fiscal year, information related to—
(i)
 provider-related donations made to the State or units of local government during such fiscal year, and




(ii)
 health care related taxes collected by the State or such units during such fiscal year.






(B)
 Each State shall include, in the first report submitted under paragraph (1) after the end of each fiscal year, information related to the total amount of payment adjustments made, and the amount of payment adjustments made to individual providers (by provider), under 
section 1396r–4(c) of this title
 during such fiscal year.






(e)
 Transition costs of closures or conversions permitted
A State plan approved under this subchapter may include, as a cost with respect to hospital services under the plan under this subchapter, periodic expenditures made to reflect transitional allowances established with respect to a hospital closure or conversion under 
section 1395uu of this title
.




(f)
 Limitation on Federal participation in medical assistance
(1)
(A)
 Except as provided in paragraph (4), payment under the preceding provisions of this section shall not be made with respect to any amount expended as medical assistance in a calendar quarter, in any State, for any member of a family the annual income of which exceeds the applicable income limitation determined under this paragraph.




(B)
(i)
 Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the applicable income limitation with respect to any family is the amount determined, in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, to be equivalent to 133⅓ percent of the highest amount which would ordinarily be paid to a family of the same size without any income or resources, in the form of money payments, under the plan of the State approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.




(ii)
 If the Secretary finds that the operation of a uniform maximum limits payments to families of more than one size, he may adjust the amount otherwise determined under clause (i) to take account of families of different sizes.






(C)
 The total amount of any applicable income limitation determined under subparagraph (B) shall, if it is not a multiple of $100 or such other amount as the Secretary may prescribe, be rounded to the next higher multiple of $100 or such other amount, as the case may be.






(2)
(A)
 In computing a family’s income for purposes of paragraph (1), there shall be excluded any costs (whether in the form of insurance premiums or otherwise and regardless of whether such costs are reimbursed under another public program of the State or political subdivision thereof) incurred by such family for medical care or for any other type of remedial care recognized under State law or, (B) notwithstanding section 1396
o
 of this title at State option, an amount paid by such family, at the family’s option, to the State, provided that the amount, when combined with costs incurred in prior months, is sufficient when excluded from the family’s income to reduce such family’s income below the applicable income limitation described in paragraph (1). The amount of State expenditures for which medical assistance is available under subsection (a)(1) of this section will be reduced by amounts paid to the State pursuant to this subparagraph.






(3)
 For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), in the case of a family consisting of only one individual, the “highest amount which would ordinarily be paid” to such family under the State’s plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter shall be the amount determined by the State agency (on the basis of reasonable relationship to the amounts payable under such plan to families consisting of two or more persons) to be the amount of the aid which would ordinarily be payable under such plan to a family (without any income or resources) consisting of one person if such plan provided for aid to such a family.




(4)
 The limitations on payment imposed by the preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any amount expended by a State as medical assistance for any individual described in section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(V), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIV), or

(B)
 who is not receiving such aid or assistance, and with respect to whom such benefits are not being paid, but (i) is eligible to receive such aid or assistance, or to have such benefits paid with respect to him, or (ii) would be eligible to receive such aid or assistance, or to have such benefits paid with respect to him if he were not in a medical institution, or




(C)
 with respect to whom there is being paid, or who is eligible, or would be eligible if he were not in a medical institution, to have paid with respect to him, a State supplementary payment and is eligible for medical assistance equal in amount, duration, and scope to the medical assistance made available to individuals described in 
section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title
, or who is a PACE program eligible individual enrolled in a PACE program under 
section 1396u–4 of this title
, but only if the income of such individual (as determined under 
section 1382a of this title
, but without regard to subsection (b) thereof) does not exceed 300 percent of the supplemental security income benefit rate established by 
section 1382(b)(1) of this title
,





at the time of the provision of the medical assistance giving rise to such expenditure.




(g)
 Decrease in Federal medical assistance percentage of amounts paid for services furnished under State plan after 
June 30, 1973
(1)
 Subject to paragraph (3), with respect to amounts paid for the following services furnished under the State plan after 
June 30, 1973
 (other than services furnished pursuant to a contract with a health maintenance organization as defined in 
section 1395mm of this title
 or which is a qualified health maintenance organization (as defined in section 300e–9(d) 
4
 of this title)), the Federal medical assistance percentage shall be decreased as follows: After an individual has received inpatient hospital services or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded for 60 days or inpatient mental hospital services for 90 days (whether or not such days are consecutive), during any fiscal year, the Federal medical assistance percentage with respect to amounts paid for any such care furnished thereafter to such individual shall be decreased by a per centum thereof (determined under paragraph (5)) unless the State agency responsible for the administration of the plan makes a showing satisfactory to the Secretary that, with respect to each calendar quarter for which the State submits a request for payment at the full Federal medical assistance percentage for amounts paid for inpatient hospital services or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded furnished beyond 60 days (or inpatient mental hospital services furnished beyond 90 days), such State has an effective program of medical review of the care of patients in mental hospitals and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded pursuant to paragraphs (26) and (31) of 
section 1396a(a) of this title
 whereby the professional management of each case is reviewed and evaluated at least annually by independent professional review teams. In determining the number of days on which an individual has received services described in this subsection, there shall not be counted any days with respect to which such individual is entitled to have payments made (in whole or in part) on his behalf under 
section 1395d of this title
.




(2)
 The Secretary shall, as part of his validation procedures under this subsection, conduct timely sample onsite surveys of private and public institutions in which recipients of medical assistance may receive care and services under a State plan approved under this subchapter, and his findings with respect to such surveys (as well as the showings of the State agency required under this subsection) shall be made available for public inspection.




(3)
(A)
 No reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under this subsection shall take effect—
(i)
 if such reduction is due to the State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning before 
January 1, 1977
;




(ii)
 before 
January 1, 1978
;




(iii)
 unless a notice of such reduction has been provided to the State at least 30 days before the date such reduction takes effect; or




(iv)
 due to the State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning after 
September 30, 1977
, unless notice of such reduction has been provided to the State no later than the first day of the fourth calendar quarter following the calendar quarter with respect to which such showing was made.






(B)
 The Secretary shall waive application of any reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under paragraph (1) because a showing by the State, made under such paragraph with respect to a calendar quarter ending after 
January 1, 1977
, and before 
January 1, 1978
, is determined to be either unsatisfactory under such paragraph or invalid under paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State’s showing made under paragraph (1) with respect to any calendar quarter ending on or before 
December 31, 1978
, is satisfactory under such paragraph and is valid under paragraph (2).






(4)
(A)
 The Secretary may not find the showing of a State, with respect to a calendar quarter under paragraph (1), to be satisfactory if the showing is submitted to the Secretary later than the 30th day after the last day of the calendar quarter, unless the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary good cause for not meeting such deadline.




(B)
 The Secretary shall find a showing of a State, with respect to a calendar quarter under paragraph (1), to be satisfactory under such paragraph with respect to the requirement that the State conduct annual onsite inspections in mental hospitals and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded under paragraphs (26) and (31) of 
section 1396a(a) of this title
, if the showing demonstrates that the State has conducted such an onsite inspection during the 12-month period ending on the last date of the calendar quarter—
(i)
 in each of not less than 98 per centum of the number of such hospitals and facilities requiring such inspection, and




(ii)
 in every such hospital or facility which has 200 or more beds,





and that, with respect to such hospitals and facilities not inspected within such period, the State has exercised good faith and due diligence in attempting to conduct such inspection, or if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it would have made such a showing but for failings of a technical nature only.






(5)
 In the case of a State’s unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a type of facility or institutional services in a calendar quarter, the per centum amount of the reduction of the State’s Federal medical assistance percentage for that type of services under paragraph (1) is equal to 33⅓ per centum multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of patients receiving that type of services in that quarter under the State plan in facilities or institutions for which a showing was required to be made under this subsection, and the numerator of which is equal to the number of such patients receiving such type of services in that quarter in those facilities or institutions for which a satisfactory and valid showing was not made for that calendar quarter.




(6)
(A)
 Recertifications required under 
section 1396a(a)(44) of this title
 shall be conducted at least every 60 days in the case of inpatient hospital services.




(B)
 Such recertifications in the case of services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded shall be conducted at least—
(i)
 60 days after the date of the initial certification,




(ii)
 180 days after the date of the initial certification,




(iii)
 12 months after the date of the initial certification,




(iv)
 18 months after the date of the initial certification,




(v)
 24 months after the date of the initial certification, and




(vi)
 every 12 months thereafter.






(C)

 or a Medicare+Choice organization with a contract under part C of subchapter XVIII of this chapter, a provider sponsored organization, or any other public or private organization, which meets the requirement of 
section 1396a(w) of this title

 the solvency of the organization is guaranteed by the State; or




(IV)

(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (G), no payment shall be made under this subchapter to a State with respect to expenditures incurred by it for payment (determined under a prepaid capitation basis or under any other risk basis) for services provided by any entity (including a health insuring organization) which is responsible for the provision (directly or through arrangements with providers of services) of inpatient hospital services and any other service described in paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5), or (7) of 
section 1396d(a) of this title

(v)
 such contract provides that in the entity’s enrollment, reenrollment, or disenrollment of individuals who are eligible for benefits under this subchapter and eligible to enroll, reenroll, or disenroll with the entity pursuant to the contract, the entity will not discriminate among such individuals on the basis of their health status or requirements for health care services;




(vi)
 such contract (I) permits individuals who have elected under the plan to enroll with the entity for provision of such benefits to terminate such enrollment in accordance with 
section 1396u–2(a)(4) of this title

section 1396r–8(b)(2)(A) of this title
, information on the total number of units of each dosage form and strength and package size by National Drug Code of each covered outpatient drug dispensed to individuals eligible for medical assistance who are enrolled with the entity and for which the entity is responsible for coverage of such drug under this subsection (other than covered outpatient drugs that under subsection (j)(1) of

 to Medicaid providers described in paragraph (2)(A) not in excess of 85 percent of net average allowable costs (as defined in paragraph (3)(E)) for certified EHR technology (and support services including maintenance and training that is for, or is necessary for the adoption and operation of, such technology) with respect to such providers; and




(B)
 to Medicaid providers described in paragraph (2)(B) not in excess of the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (5) for the provider involved.

o
) and 1395w–23(
l
) of this title with respect to the eligible professional has been waived in a manner specified by the Secretary. For purposes of calculating patient volume under subparagraph (A)(iii), insofar as it is related to uncompensated care, the Secretary may require the adjustment of such uncompensated care data so that it would be an appropriate proxy for charity care, including a downward adjustment to eliminate bad debt data from uncompensated care. In applying subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii), the methodology established by the Secretary for patient volume shall include individuals enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan (under section subsection (m) or 
section 1396u–2 of this title

 The term “hospital-based” means, with respect to an eligible professional, a professional (such as a pathologist, anesthesiologist, or emergency physician) who furnishes substantially all of the individual’s professional services in a hospital inpatient or emergency room setting and through the use of the facilities and equipment, including qualified electronic health records, of the hospital. The determination of whether an eligible professional is a hospital-based eligible professional shall be made on the basis of the site of service (as defined by the Secretary) and without regard to any employment or billing arrangement between the eligible professional and any other provider.




(E)
 The term “net average allowable costs” means, with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A), average allowable costs reduced by the average payment the Secretary estimates will be made to such Medicaid providers (determined on a percentage or other basis for such classes or types of providers as the Secretary may specify) from other sources (other than under this subsection, or by the Federal government or a State or local government) that is directly attributable to payment for certified EHR technology or support services described in subparagraph (C).




(F)
 The term “needy individual” means, with respect to a Medicaid provider, an individual—

 For the purposes of determining average allowable costs under this subsection, the Secretary shall study the average costs to Medicaid providers described in paragraph (2)(A) of purchase and initial implementation and upgrade of certified EHR technology described in paragraph (3)(C)(i) and the average costs to such providers of operations, maintenance, and use of such technology described in paragraph (3)(C)(ii). In determining such costs for such providers, the Secretary may utilize studies of such amounts submitted by States.






(5)
(A)
 In no case shall the payments described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(B) exceed—
(i)
 in the aggregate the product of—
(I)
 the overall hospital EHR amount for the provider computed under subparagraph (B); and




(II)
 the Medicaid share for such provider computed under subparagraph (C);






(ii)
 in any year 50 percent of the product described in clause (i); and




(iii)
 in any 2-year period 90 percent of such product.

 For purposes of this paragraph, the overall hospital EHR amount, with respect to a Medicaid provider, is the sum of the applicable amounts specified in 
section 1395ww(n)(2)(A) of this title
 for such provider for the first 4 payment years (as estimated by the Secretary) determined as if the Medicare share specified in clause (ii) of such section were 1. The Secretary shall establish, in consultation with the State, the overall hospital EHR amount for each such Medicaid provider eligible for payments under paragraph (1)(B). For purposes of this subparagraph in computing the amounts under 
section 1395ww(n)(2)(C) of this title
 for payment years after the first payment year, the Secretary shall assume that in subsequent payment years discharges increase at the average annual rate of growth of the most recent 3 years for which discharge data are available per year.




(C)
 The Medicaid share computed under this subparagraph, for a Medicaid provider for a period specified by the Secretary, shall be calculated in the same manner as the Medicare share under 
section 1395ww(n)(2)(D) of this title
 for such a hospital and period, except that there shall be substituted for the numerator under clause (i) of such section the amount that is equal to the number of inpatient-bed-days (as established by the Secretary) which are attributable to individuals who are receiving medical assistance under this subchapter and who are not described in 
section 1395ww(n)(2)(D)(i) of this title
. In computing inpatient-bed-days under the previous sentence, the Secretary shall take into account inpatient-bed-days attributable to inpatient-bed-days that are paid for individuals enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan (under subsection (m) or 
section 1396u–2 of this title
).




(D)
 In no case may the payments described in paragraph (1)(B) with respect to a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(B) be paid—
(i)
 for any year beginning after 2016 unless the provider has been provided payment under paragraph (1)(B) for the previous year; and




(ii)
 over a period of more than 6 years of payment.








(6)
 Payments described in paragraph (1) are not in accordance with this subsection unless the following requirements are met:
(A)
(i)
 The State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that amounts received under subsection (a)(3)(F) with respect to payments to a Medicaid provider are paid, subject to clause (ii), directly to such provider (or to an employer or facility to which such provider has assigned payments) without any deduction or rebate.




(ii)
 Amounts described in clause (i) may also be paid to an entity promoting the adoption of certified EHR technology, as designated by the State, if participation in such a payment arrangement is voluntary for the eligible professional involved and if such entity does not retain more than 5 percent of such payments for costs not related to certified EHR technology (and support services including maintenance and training) that is for, or is necessary for the operation of, such technology.






(B)
 A Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A) is responsible for payment of the remaining 15 percent of the net average allowable cost and shall be determined to have met such responsibility to the extent that the payment to the Medicaid provider is not in excess of 85 percent of the net average allowable cost.




(C)
(i)
 Subject to clause (ii), with respect to payments to a Medicaid provider—
(I)
 for the first year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, the Medicaid provider demonstrates that it is engaged in efforts to adopt, implement, or upgrade certified EHR technology; and




(II)
 for a year of payment, other than the first year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, the Medicaid provider demonstrates meaningful use of certified EHR technology through a means that is approved by the State and acceptable to the Secretary, and that may be based upon the methodologies applied under section 1395w–4(
o
) or 1395ww(n) of this title.






(ii)
 In the case of a Medicaid provider who has completed adopting, implementing, or upgrading such technology prior to the first year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, clause (i)(I) shall not apply and clause (i)(II) shall apply to each year of payment to the Medicaid provider under this subsection, including the first year of payment.






(D)
 To the extent specified by the Secretary, the certified EHR technology is compatible with State or Federal administrative management systems.





For purposes of subparagraph (B), a Medicaid provider described in paragraph (2)(A) may accept payments for the costs described in such subparagraph from a State or local government. For purposes of subparagraph (C), in establishing the means described in such subparagraph, which may include clinical quality reporting to the State, the State shall ensure that populations with unique needs, such as children, are appropriately addressed.




(7)
 With respect to Medicaid providers described in paragraph (2)(A), the Secretary shall ensure coordination of payment with respect to such providers under sections 1395w–4(
o
) and 1395w–23(
l
) of this title and under this subsection to assure no duplication of funding. Such coordination shall include, to the extent practicable, a data matching process between State Medicaid agencies and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services using national provider identifiers. For such purposes, the Secretary may require the submission of such data relating to payments to such Medicaid providers as the Secretary may specify.




(8)
 In carrying out paragraph (6)(C), the State and Secretary shall seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to avoid duplicative requirements from Federal and State governments to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology under this subchapter and subchapter XVIII. In doing so, the Secretary may deem satisfaction of requirements for such meaningful use for a payment year under subchapter XVIII to be sufficient to qualify as meaningful use under this subsection. The Secretary may also specify the reporting periods under this subsection in order to carry out this paragraph.




(9)
 In order to be provided Federal financial participation under subsection (a)(3)(F)(ii), a State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the State—
(A)
 is using the funds provided for the purposes of administering payments under this subsection, including tracking of meaningful use by Medicaid providers;




(B)
 is conducting adequate oversight of the program under this subsection, including routine tracking of meaningful use attestations and reporting mechanisms; and




(C)
 is pursuing initiatives to encourage the adoption of certified EHR technology to promote health care quality and the exchange of health care information under this subchapter, subject to applicable laws and regulations governing such exchange.






(10)
 The Secretary shall periodically submit reports to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on status, progress, and oversight of payments described in paragraph (1), including steps taken to carry out paragraph (7). Such reports shall also describe the extent of adoption of certified EHR technology among Medicaid providers resulting from the provisions of this subsection and any improvements in health outcomes, clinical quality, or efficiency resulting from such adoption.




(u)
 Limitation of Federal financial participation in erroneous medical assistance expenditures
(1)
(A)
 Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, if the ratio of a State’s erroneous excess payments for medical assistance (as defined in subparagraph (D)) to its total expenditures for medical assistance under the State plan approved under this subchapter exceeds 0.03, for the period consisting of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 1983, or for any full fiscal year thereafter, then the Secretary shall make no payment for such period or fiscal year with respect to so much of such erroneous excess payments as exceeds such allowable error rate of 0.03.




(B)
 The Secretary may waive, in certain limited cases, all or part of the reduction required under subparagraph (A) with respect to any State if such State is unable to reach the allowable error rate for a period or fiscal year despite a good faith effort by such State.




(C)
 In estimating the amount to be paid to a State under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration the limitation on Federal financial participation imposed by subparagraph (A) and shall reduce the estimate he makes under subsection (d)(1) of this section, for purposes of payment to the State under subsection (d)(3) of this section, in light of any expected erroneous excess payments for medical assistance (estimated in accordance with such criteria, including sampling procedures, as he may prescribe and subject to subsequent adjustment, if necessary, under subsection (d)(2) of this section).




(D)
(i)
 For purposes of this subsection, the term “erroneous excess payments for medical assistance” means the total of—
(I)
 payments under the State plan with respect to ineligible individuals and families, and




(II)
 overpayments on behalf of eligible individuals and families by reason of error in determining the amount of expenditures for medical care required of an individual or family as a condition of eligibility.






(ii)
 In determining the amount of erroneous excess payments for medical assistance to an ineligible individual or family under clause (i)(I), if such ineligibility is the result of an error in determining the amount of the resources of such individual or family, the amount of the erroneous excess payment shall be the smaller of (I) the amount of the payment with respect to such individual or family, or (II) the difference between the actual amount of such resources and the allowable resource level established under the State plan.




(iii)
 In determining the amount of erroneous excess payments for medical assistance to an individual or family under clause (i)(II), the amount of the erroneous excess payment shall be the smaller of (I) the amount of the payment on behalf of the individual or family, or (II) the difference between the actual amount incurred for medical care by the individual or family and the amount which should have been incurred in order to establish eligibility for medical assistance.




(iv)
 In determining the amount of erroneous excess payments, there shall not be included any error resulting from a failure of an individual to cooperate or give correct information with respect to third-party liability as required under section 1396k(a)(1)(C) or 602(a)(26)(C) 
4
 of this title or with respect to payments made in violation of 
section 1396e of this title

section 1396a(a)(47)(B) of this title
 to be a qualified entity for such purpose.






(E)
 For purposes of subparagraph (D), there shall be excluded, in determining both erroneous excess payments for medical assistance and total expenditures for medical assistance—
(i)
 payments with respect to any individual whose eligibility therefor was determined exclusively by the Secretary under an agreement pursuant to 
section 1383c of this title
 and such other classes of individuals as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe whose eligibility was determined in part under such an agreement; and




(ii)
 payments made as the result of a technical error.








(2)
 The State agency administering the plan approved under this subchapter shall, at such times and in such form as the Secretary may specify, provide information on the rates of erroneous excess payments made (or expected, with respect to future periods specified by the Secretary) in connection with its administration of such plan, together with any other data he requests that are reasonably necessary for him to carry out the provisions of this subsection.




(3)
(A)
 If a State fails to cooperate with the Secretary in providing information necessary to carry out this subsection, the Secretary, directly or through contractual or such other arrangements as he may find appropriate, shall establish the error rates for that State on the basis of the best data reasonably available to him and in accordance with such techniques for sampling and estimating as he finds appropriate.




(B)
 In any case in which it is necessary for the Secretary to exercise his authority under subparagraph (A) to determine a State’s error rates for a fiscal year, the amount that would otherwise be payable to such State under this subchapter for quarters in such year shall be reduced by the costs incurred by the Secretary in making (directly or otherwise) such determination.






(4)
 This subsection shall not apply with respect to Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, or American Samoa.




(v)

 Payment adjustment for health care-acquired conditions
(a)
 In general
The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this subsection referred to as the “Secretary”) shall identify current State practices that prohibit payment for health care-acquired conditions and shall incorporate the practices identified, or elements of such practices, which the Secretary determines appropriate for application to the Medicaid program in regulations. Such regulations shall be effective as of

42 U.S.C. 1396b
] for any amounts expended for providing medical assistance for health care-acquired conditions specified in the regulations.

42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(4)(D)
) relating to the prohibition of payments based on the presence of a secondary diagnosis code specified by the Secretary in such regulations, as appropriate for the Medicaid program. The Secretary may exclude certain conditions identified under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [

 Waiver of standards other than good character or suitability standards
No State shall be considered to have failed to comply with the provisions of 
section 1396a(a)(29) of this title
 because the agency or board of such State (established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section) shall have granted any waiver, with respect to any individual who, during all of the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the requirements prescribed in 
section 1396a(a)(29) of this title

 Compliance with State plan and payment provisions
(a)
 Activities deemed as compliance
A State shall not be deemed to be out of compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (10), or (23) of 
section 1396a(a) of this title
 solely by reason of the fact that the State (or any political subdivision thereof)—
(1)
 has entered into—
(A)
 a contract with an organization which has agreed to provide care and services in addition to those offered under the State plan to individuals eligible for medical assistance who reside in the geographic area served by such organization and who elect to obtain such care and services from such organization, or by reason of the fact that the plan provides for payment for rural health clinic services only if those services are provided by a rural health clinic; or




(B)
 arrangements through a competitive bidding process or otherwise for the purchase of laboratory services referred to in 
section 1396d(a)(3) of this title
 or medical devices if the Secretary has found that—
(i)
 adequate services or devices will be available under such arrangements, and




(ii)
 any such laboratory services will be provided only through laboratories—
(I)
 which meet the applicable requirements of 
section 1395x(e)(9) of this title
 or paragraphs (16) and (17) of 
section 1395x(s) of this title
, and such additional requirements as the Secretary may require, and




(II)
 no more than 75 percent of whose charges for such services are for services provided to individuals who are entitled to benefits under this subchapter or under part A or part B of subchapter XVIII of this chapter; or










(2)
 restricts for a reasonable period of time the provider or providers from which an individual (eligible for medical assistance for items or services under the State plan) can receive such items or services, if—
(A)
 the State has found, after notice and opportunity for a hearing (in accordance with procedures established by the State), that the individual has utilized such items or services at a frequency or amount not medically necessary (as determined in accordance with utilization guidelines established by the State), and




(B)
 under such restriction, individuals eligible for medical assistance for such services have reasonable access (taking into account geographic location and reasonable travel time) to such services of adequate quality.






(b)
 Waivers to promote cost-effectiveness and efficiency
The Secretary, to the extent he finds it to be cost-effective and efficient and not inconsistent with the purposes of this subchapter, may waive such requirements of 
section 1396a of this title
 (other than subsection (s)) (other than sections 1396a(a)(15), 1396a(bb), and 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title insofar as it requires provision of the care and services described in 
section 1396d(a)(2)(C) of this title
) as may be necessary for a State—
(1)
 to implement a primary care case-management system or a specialty physician services arrangement which restricts the provider from (or through) whom an individual (eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter) can obtain medical care services (other than in emergency circumstances), if such restriction does not substantially impair access to such services of adequate quality where medically necessary,




(2)
 to allow a locality to act as a central broker in assisting individuals (eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter) in selecting among competing health care plans, if such restriction does not substantially impair access to services of adequate quality where medically necessary,




(3)
 to share (through provision of additional services) with recipients of medical assistance under the State plan cost savings resulting from use by the recipient of more cost-effective medical care, and




(4)
 to restrict the provider from (or through) whom an individual (eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter) can obtain services (other than in emergency circumstances) to providers or practitioners who undertake to provide such services and who meet, accept, and comply with the reimbursement, quality, and utilization standards under the State plan, which standards shall be consistent with the requirements of 
section 1396r–4 of this title
 and are consistent with access, quality, and efficient and economic provision of covered care and services, if such restriction does not discriminate among classes of providers on grounds unrelated to their demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency in providing those services and if providers under such restriction are paid on a timely basis in the same manner as health care practitioners must be paid under 
section 1396a(a)(37)(A) of this title
.





No waiver under this subsection may restrict the choice of the individual in receiving services under 
section 1396d(a)(4)(C) of this title
. Subsection (h)(2) shall apply to a waiver under this subsection.


(c)
 Waiver respecting medical assistance requirement in State plan; scope, etc.; “habilitation services” defined; imposition of certain regulatory limits prohibited; computation of expenditures for certain disabled patients; coordinated services; substitution of participants
(1)
 The Secretary may by waiver provide that a State plan approved under this subchapter may include as “medical assistance” under such plan payment for part or all of the cost of home or community-based services (other than room and board) approved by the Secretary which are provided pursuant to a written plan of care to individuals with respect to whom there has been a determination that but for the provision of such services the individuals would require the level of care provided in a hospital or a nursing facility or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded the cost of which could be reimbursed under the State plan. For purposes of this subsection, the term “room and board” shall not include an amount established under a method determined by the State to reflect the portion of costs of rent and food attributable to an unrelated personal caregiver who is residing in the same household with an individual who, but for the assistance of such caregiver, would require admission to a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.




(2)
 A waiver shall not be granted under this subsection unless the State provides assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that—
(A)
 necessary safeguards (including adequate standards for provider participation) have been taken to protect the health and welfare of individuals provided services under the waiver and to assure financial accountability for funds expended with respect to such services;




(B)
 the State will provide, with respect to individuals who—
(i)
 are entitled to medical assistance for inpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded under the State plan,




(ii)
 may require such services, and




(iii)
 may be eligible for such home or community-based care under such waiver,





for an evaluation of the need for inpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded;




(C)
 such individuals who are determined to be likely to require the level of care provided in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded are informed of the feasible alternatives, if available under the waiver, at the choice of such individuals, to the provision of inpatient hospital services, nursing facility services, or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded;




(D)
 under such waiver the average per capita expenditure estimated by the State in any fiscal year for medical assistance provided with respect to such individuals does not exceed 100 percent of the average per capita expenditure that the State reasonably estimates would have been made in that fiscal year for expenditures under the State plan for such individuals if the waiver had not been granted; and




(E)
 the State will provide to the Secretary annually, consistent with a data collection plan designed by the Secretary, information on the impact of the waiver granted under this subsection on the type and amount of medical assistance provided under the State plan and on the health and welfare of recipients.






(3)
 A waiver granted under this subsection may include a waiver of the requirements of 
section 1396a(a)(1) of this title
 (relating to statewideness), 
section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title
 (relating to comparability), and 
section 1396a(a)(10)(C)(i)(III) of this title
 (relating to income and resource rules applicable in the community). A waiver under this subsection (other than a waiver described in subsection (h)(2)) shall be for an initial term of three years and, upon the request of a State, shall be extended for additional five-year periods unless the Secretary determines that for the previous waiver period the assurances provided under paragraph (2) have not been met. A waiver may provide, with respect to post-eligibility treatment of income of all individuals receiving services under that waiver, that the maximum amount of the individual’s income which may be disregarded for any month for the maintenance needs of the individual may be an amount greater than the maximum allowed for that purpose under regulations in effect on 
July 1, 1985
.




(4)
 A waiver granted under this subsection may, consistent with paragraph (2)—
(A)
 limit the individuals provided benefits under such waiver to individuals with respect to whom the State has determined that there is a reasonable expectation that the amount of medical assistance provided with respect to the individual under such waiver will not exceed the amount of such medical assistance provided for such individual if the waiver did not apply, and




(B)
 provide medical assistance to individuals (to the extent consistent with written plans of care, which are subject to the approval of the State) for case management services, homemaker/home health aide services and personal care services, adult day health services, habilitation services, respite care, and such other services requested by the State as the Secretary may approve and for day treatment or other partial hospitalization services, psychosocial rehabilitation services, and clinic services (whether or not furnished in a facility) for individuals with chronic mental illness.





Except as provided under paragraph (2)(D), the Secretary may not restrict the number of hours or days of respite care in any period which a State may provide under a waiver under this subsection.




(5)
 For purposes of paragraph (4)(B), the term “habilitation services”—
(A)
 means services designed to assist individuals in acquiring, retaining, and improving the self-help, socialization, and adaptive skills necessary to reside successfully in home and community based settings; and




(B)
 includes (except as provided in subparagraph (C)) prevocational, educational, and supported employment services; but




(C)
 does not include—
(i)
 special education and related services (as such terms are defined in 
section 1401 of title 20
) which otherwise are available to the individual through a local educational agency; and




(ii)
 vocational rehabilitation services which otherwise are available to the individual through a program funded under 
section 730 of title 29
.








(6)
 The Secretary may not require, as a condition of approval of a waiver under this section under paragraph (2)(D), that the actual total expenditures for home and community-based services under the waiver (and a claim for Federal financial participation in expenditures for the services) cannot exceed the approved estimates for these services. The Secretary may not deny Federal financial payment with respect to services under such a waiver on the ground that, in order to comply with paragraph (2)(D), a State has failed to comply with such a requirement.




(7)
(A)
 In making estimates under paragraph (2)(D) in the case of a waiver that applies only to individuals with a particular illness or condition who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, hospitals, nursing facilities, or intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, the State may determine the average per capita expenditure that would have been made in a fiscal year for those individuals under the State plan separately from the expenditures for other individuals who are inpatients in, or who would require the level of care provided in, those respective facilities.




(B)

(II)
 a method, based on an index of appropriately weighted indicators of changes in the wages and prices of the mix of goods and services which comprise home and community-based services (regardless of the source of payment for such services), for projecting the percentage increase for purposes of clause (ii)(I); and




(III)
 a method for projecting, on a State specific basis, the percentage increase in the number of residents in each State who are over 65 years of age for any period.

(c)

(A)
 In order to meet the requirements of this subsection for purposes of 
section 1396a(a)(18) of this title

(E)
(i)
 With respect to an institutionalized individual, the number of months of ineligibility under this subparagraph for an individual shall be equal to—
(I)

(II)
 the average monthly cost to a private patient of nursing facility services in the State (or, at the option of the State, in the community in which the individual is institutionalized) at the time of application.

(H)
 Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this paragraph, in the case of an individual (or individual’s spouse) who makes multiple fractional transfers of assets in more than 1 month for less than fair market value on or after the applicable look-back date specified in subparagraph (B), a State may determine the period of ineligibility applicable to such individual under this paragraph by—
(i)
 treating the total, cumulative uncompensated value of all assets transferred by the individual (or individual’s spouse) during all months on or after the look-back date specified in subparagraph (B) as 1 transfer for purposes of clause (i) or (ii) (as the case may be) of subparagraph (E); and




(ii)
 beginning such period on the earliest date which would apply under subparagraph (D) to any of such transfers.






(I)
 For purposes of this paragraph with respect to a transfer of assets, the term “assets” includes funds used to purchase a promissory note, loan, or mortgage unless such note, loan, or mortgage—
(i)
 has a repayment term that is actuarially sound (as determined in accordance with actuarial publications of the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration);




(ii)
 provides for payments to be made in equal amounts during the term of the loan, with no deferral and no balloon payments made; and




(iii)
 prohibits the cancellation of the balance upon the death of the lender.





In the case of a promissory note, loan, or mortgage that does not satisfy the requirements of clauses (i) through (iii), the value of such note, loan, or mortgage shall be the outstanding balance due as of the date of the individual’s application for medical assistance for services described in subparagraph (C).




(J)
 For purposes of this paragraph with respect to a transfer of assets, the term “assets” includes the purchase of a life estate interest in another individual’s home unless the purchaser resides in the home for a period of at least 1 year after the date of the purchase.

(A)
 the assets transferred were a home and title to the home was transferred to—
(i)
 the spouse of such individual;




(ii)
 a child of such individual who (I) is under age 21, or (II) (with respect to States eligible to participate in the State program established under subchapter XVI of this chapter) is blind or permanently and totally disabled, or (with respect to States which are not eligible to participate in such program) is blind or disabled as defined in 
section 1382c of this title
;




(iii)
 a sibling of such individual who has an equity interest in such home and who was residing in such individual’s home for a period of at least one year immediately before the date the individual becomes an institutionalized individual; or




(iv)
 a son or daughter of such individual (other than a child described in clause (ii)) who was residing in such individual’s home for a period of at least two years immediately before the date the individual becomes an institutionalized individual, and who (as determined by the State) provided care to such individual which permitted such individual to reside at home rather than in such an institution or facility;






(B)

 were transferred from the individual’s spouse to another for the sole benefit of the individual’s spouse,

 a satisfactory showing is made to the State (in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary) that (i) the individual intended to dispose of the assets either at fair market value, or for other valuable consideration, (ii) the assets were transferred exclusively for a purpose other than to qualify for medical assistance, or (iii) all assets transferred for less than fair market value have been returned to the individual; or




(D)
 the State determines, under procedures established by the State (in accordance with standards specified by the Secretary), that the denial of eligibility would work an undue hardship as determined on the basis of criteria established by the Secretary.





The procedures established under subparagraph (D) shall permit the facility in which the institutionalized individual is residing to file an undue hardship waiver application on behalf of the individual with the consent of the individual or the personal representative of the individual. While an application for an undue hardship waiver is pending under subparagraph (D) in the case of an individual who is a resident of a nursing facility, if the application meets such criteria as the Secretary specifies, the State may provide for payments for nursing facility services in order to hold the bed for the individual at the facility, but not in excess of payments for 30 days.




(3)
 For purposes of this subsection, in the case of an asset held by an individual in common with another person or persons in a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, or similar arrangement, the asset (or the affected portion of such asset) shall be considered to be transferred by such individual when any action is taken, either by such individual or by any other person, that reduces or eliminates such individual’s ownership or control of such asset.

 A State (including a State which has elected treatment under 
section 1396a(f) of this title
) may not provide for any period of ineligibility for an individual due to transfer of resources for less than fair market value except in accordance with this subsection. In the case of a transfer by the spouse of an individual which results in a period of ineligibility for medical assistance under a State plan for such individual, a State shall, using a reasonable methodology (as specified by the Secretary), apportion such period of ineligibility (or any portion of such period) among the individual and the individual’s spouse if the spouse otherwise becomes eligible for medical assistance under the State plan.




(5)
 In this subsection, the term “resources” has the meaning given such term in 
section 1382b of this title
, without regard to the exclusion described in subsection (a)(1) thereof.

 In the case of a revocable trust—
(i)
 the corpus of the trust shall be considered resources available to the individual,




(ii)
 payments from the trust to or for the benefit of the individual shall be considered income of the individual, and




(iii)
 any other payments from the trust shall be considered assets disposed of by the individual for purposes of subsection (c) of this section.






(B)
 In the case of an irrevocable trust—
(i)
 if there are any circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual, the portion of the corpus from which, or the income on the corpus from which, payment to the individual could be made shall be considered resources available to the individual, and payments from that portion of the corpus or income—
(I)
 to or for the benefit of the individual, shall be considered income of the individual, and




(II)
 for any other purpose, shall be considered a transfer of assets by the individual subject to subsection (c) of this section; and






(ii)
 any portion of the trust from which, or any income on the corpus from which, no payment could under any circumstances be made to the individual shall be considered, as of the date of establishment of the trust (or, if later, the date on which payment to the individual was foreclosed) to be assets disposed by the individual for purposes of subsection (c) of this section, and the value of the trust shall be determined for purposes of such subsection by including the amount of any payments made from such portion of the trust after such date.








(4)
 This subsection shall not apply to any of the following trusts:
(A)
 A trust containing the assets of an individual under age 65 who is disabled (as defined in 
section 1382c(a)(3) of this title
) and which is established for the benefit of such individual by a parent, grandparent, legal guardian of the individual, or a court if the State will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of such individual up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual under a State plan under this subchapter.

) by the parent, grandparent, or legal guardian of such individuals, by such individuals, or by a court.




(iv)
 To the extent that amounts remaining in the beneficiary’s account upon the death of the beneficiary are not retained by the trust, the trust pays to the State from such remaining amounts in the account an amount equal to the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary under the State plan under this subchapter.








(5)
 The State agency shall establish procedures (in accordance with standards specified by the Secretary) under which the agency waives the application of this subsection with respect to an individual if the individual establishes that such application would work an undue hardship on the individual as determined on the basis of criteria established by the Secretary.

Such application or recertification form shall include a statement that under paragraph (2) the State becomes a remainder beneficiary under such an annuity or similar financial instrument by virtue of the provision of such medical assistance.




(2)
(A)
 In the case of disclosure concerning an annuity under subsection (c)(1)(F), the State shall notify the issuer of the annuity of the right of the State under such subsection as a preferred remainder beneficiary in the annuity for medical assistance furnished to the individual.

 In the case of such an issuer receiving notice under subparagraph (A), the State may require the issuer to notify the State when there is a change in the amount of income or principal being withdrawn from the amount that was being withdrawn at the time of the most recent disclosure described in paragraph (1).

 The Secretary may provide guidance to States on categories of transactions that may be treated as a transfer of asset for less than fair market value.




(4)

Pursuant to the requirement of section 21(b) of the Medicare-Medicaid Anti-Fraud and Abuse Amendments of 1977, the Secretary shall issue regulations, on or before the first day of the seventh month to begin after 
December 22, 1987
, that define those costs which may be charged to the personal funds of residents in nursing facilities who are individuals receiving medical assistance with respect to nursing facility services under this subchapter and those costs which are to be included in the payment amount under this subchapter for nursing facility services.






(B)
 Rule if failure to publish regulations
If the Secretary does not issue the regulations under subparagraph (A) on or before the date required in that subparagraph, in the case of a resident of a nursing facility who is eligible to receive benefits for nursing facility services under this subchapter, for purposes of 
section 1396a(a)(28)(B) of this title
, the Secretary shall be deemed to have promulgated regulations under this paragraph which provide that the costs which may not be charged to the personal funds of such resident (and for which payment is considered to be made under this subchapter) include, at a minimum, the costs for routine personal hygiene items and services furnished by the facility.








(8)
 Federal minimum criteria and monitoring for preadmission screening and resident review
(A)
 Minimum criteria
The Secretary shall develop, by not later than

 Periodic surveys
Under such program the Secretary shall conduct surveys of each facility in the program not less often than once every 6 months.








(g)
 Survey and certification process
(1)
 State and Federal responsibility
(A)
 In general
Under each State plan under this subchapter, the State shall be responsible for certifying, in accordance with surveys conducted under paragraph (2), the compliance of nursing facilities (other than facilities of the State) with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

(C)
 Investigation of allegations of resident neglect and abuse and misappropriation of resident property

The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for a hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that a nurse aide has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the nurse aide and the registry of such finding. If the State finds that any other individual used by the facility has neglected or abused a resident or misappropriated resident property in a facility, the State shall notify the appropriate licensure authority. A State shall not make a finding that an individual has neglected a resident if the individual demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the individual.

 Removal of name from nurse aide registry
(i)
 In general
In the case of a finding of neglect under subparagraph (C), the State shall establish a procedure to permit a nurse aide to petition the State to have his or her name removed from the registry upon a determination by the State that—
(I)
 the employment and personal history of the nurse aide does not reflect a pattern of abusive behavior or neglect; and




(II)
 the neglect involved in the original finding was a singular occurrence.






(ii)
 Timing of determination
In no case shall a determination on a petition submitted under clause (i) be made prior to the expiration of the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the name of the petitioner was added to the registry under subparagraph (C).








(E)
 Construction
The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.








(2)
 Surveys
(A)
 Annual standard survey
(i)
 In general
Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey, to be conducted without any prior notice to the facility. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a nursing facility of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of 
section 1320a–7a of this title
 (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under 
section 1320a–7a(a) of this title
. The Secretary shall review each State’s procedures for scheduling and conduct of standard surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.






(ii)
 Contents
Each standard survey shall include, for a case-mix stratified sample of residents—
(I)
 a survey of the quality of care furnished, as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care, dietary and nutrition services, activities and social participation, and sanitation, infection control, and the physical environment,




(II)
 written plans of care provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section and an audit of the residents’ assessments under subsection (b)(3) of this section to determine the accuracy of such assessments and the adequacy of such plans of care, and




(III)
 a review of compliance with residents’ rights under subsection (c) of this section.






(iii)
 Frequency
(I)
 In general
Each nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey not later than 15 months after the date of the previous standard survey conducted under this subparagraph. The statewide average interval between standard surveys of a nursing facility shall not exceed 12 months.






(II)
 Special surveys
If not otherwise conducted under subclause (I), a standard survey (or an abbreviated standard survey) may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management of a nursing facility, or director of nursing in order to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care furnished in the facility.










(B)
 Extended surveys
(i)
 In general
Each nursing facility which is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard quality of care shall be subject to an extended survey. Any other facility may, at the Secretary’s or State’s discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey).






(ii)
 Timing
The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practicable, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).






(iii)
 Contents
In such an extended survey, the survey team shall review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard quality of care and shall determine whether the facility has complied with all the requirements described in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Such review shall include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents’ assessments reviewed and a review of the staffing, of in-service training, and, if appropriate, of contracts with consultants.






(iv)
 Construction
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended or partial extended survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against a facility under subsection (h) of this section on the basis of findings in a standard survey.








(C)
 Survey protocol
Standard and extended surveys shall be conducted—
(i)
 based upon a protocol which the Secretary has developed, tested, and validated by not later than 
January 1, 1990
, and




(ii)
 by individuals, of a survey team, who meet such minimum qualifications as the Secretary establishes by not later than such date.





The failure of the Secretary to develop, test, or validate such protocols or to establish such minimum qualifications shall not relieve any State of its responsibility (or the Secretary of the Secretary’s responsibility) to conduct surveys under this subsection.




(D)
 Consistency of surveys
Each State shall implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results among surveyors.






(E)
 Survey teams
(i)
 In general
Surveys under this subsection shall be conducted by a multidisciplinary team of professionals (including a registered professional nurse).






(ii)
 Prohibition of conflicts of interest
A State may not use as a member of a survey team under this subsection an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the facility surveyed respecting compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the facility being surveyed.






(iii)
 Training
The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in the conduct of standard and extended surveys under this subsection, including the auditing of resident assessments and plans of care. No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.










(3)
 Validation surveys
(A)
 In general
The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State’s surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined that an individual nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary’s determination as to the facility’s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.






(B)
 Scope
With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 nursing facilities in the State.






(C)
 Reduction in administrative costs for substandard performance
If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State’s survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary may provide for the training of survey teams in the State and shall provide for a reduction of the payment otherwise made to the State under 
section 1396b(a)(2)(D) of this title
 with respect to a quarter equal to 33 percent multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities surveyed by the Secretary that quarter and the numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities which were found pursuant to such surveys to be not in compliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. A State that is dissatisfied with the Secretary’s findings under this subparagraph may obtain reconsideration and review of the findings under 
section 1316 of this title
 in the same manner as a State may seek reconsideration and review under that section of the Secretary’s determination under 
section 1316(a)(1) of this title
.






(D)
 Special surveys of compliance
Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the nursing facility meets such requirements.








(4)
 Investigation of complaints and monitoring nursing facility compliance
Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to—
(A)
 investigate complaints of violations of requirements by nursing facilities, and




(B)
 monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a nursing facility’s compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if—
(i)
 the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;




(ii)
 the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or




(iii)
 the State has reason to question the compliance of the facility with such requirements.







A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard nursing facilities.




(5)
 Disclosure of results of inspections and activities
(A)
 Public information
Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public—
(i)
 information respecting all surveys and certifications made respecting nursing facilities, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction,




(ii)
 copies of cost reports of such facilities filed under this subchapter or under subchapter XVIII of this chapter,




(iii)
 copies of statements of ownership under 
section 1320a–3 of this title
, and




(iv)
 information disclosed under 
section 1320a–5 of this title
.






(B)
 Notice to ombudsman
Each State shall notify the State long-term care ombudsman (established under title III or VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 [
42 U.S.C. 3021
 et seq., 3058 et seq.] in accordance with section 712 of the Act [
42 U.S.C. 3058g
]) of the State’s findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or of any adverse action taken against a nursing facility under paragraphs

 So in original. Probably should be “paragraph”.
 (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (h) of this section, with respect to a nursing facility in the State.






(C)
 Notice to physicians and nursing facility administrator licensing board
If a State finds that a nursing facility has provided substandard quality of care, the State shall notify—
(i)
 the attending physician of each resident with respect to which such finding is made, and




(ii)
 any State board responsible for the licensing of the nursing facility administrator of the facility.






(D)
 Access to fraud control units
Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under 
section 1396b(q) of this title
) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys and certifications under this subsection.






(E)
 Submission of survey and certification information to the Secretary
In order to improve the timeliness of information made available to the public under subparagraph (A) and provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website under subsection (i), each State shall submit information respecting any survey or certification made respecting a nursing facility (including any enforcement actions taken by the State) to the Secretary not later than the date on which the State sends such information to the facility. The Secretary shall use the information submitted under the preceding sentence to update the information provided on the Nursing Home Compare Medicare website as expeditiously as practicable but not less frequently than quarterly.








(h)
 Enforcement process
(1)
 In general
If a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection (g)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies—
(A)
 immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in paragraph (2); or




(B)
 do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State may—
(i)
 terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan,




(ii)
 provide for one or more of the remedies described in paragraph (2), or




(iii)
 do both.







Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy a nursing facility’s deficiencies. If a State finds that a nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.




(2)
 Specified remedies
(A)
 Listing
Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedies:
(i)
 Denial of payment under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to the nursing facility involved after such notice to the public and to the facility as may be provided for by the State.




(ii)
 A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the facility is or was out of compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section.

(iv)
 The authority, in the case of an emergency, to close the facility, to transfer residents in that facility to other facilities, or both.





The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the State may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.




(B)
 Deadline and guidance

October 1, 1989
. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations by not later than 
October 1, 1988
, guidance to States in establishing such remedies; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedies.




(ii)
 A State may establish alternative remedies (other than termination of participation) other than those described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A), if the State demonstrates to the Secretary’s satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as those described in subparagraph (A).






(C)
 Assuring prompt compliance
If a nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i) for all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.

 monitor the facility under subsection (g)(4)(B) of this section,





until the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the State, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that it will remain in compliance with such requirements.




(E)
 Funding
The reasonable expenditures of a State to provide for temporary management and other expenses associated with implementing the remedies described in clauses (iii) and (iv) of subparagraph (A) shall be considered, for purposes of 
section 1396b(a)(7) of this title
, to be necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan.






(F)
 Incentives for high quality care
In addition to the remedies specified in this paragraph, a State may establish a program to reward, through public recognition, incentive payments, or both, nursing facilities that provide the highest quality care to residents who are entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter. For purposes of 
section 1396b(a)(7) of this title
, proper expenses incurred by a State in carrying out such a program shall be considered to be expenses necessary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan under this subchapter.

(B)
 Other nursing facilities
With respect to any other nursing facility in a State, if the Secretary finds that a nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, and further finds that the facility’s deficiencies—
(i)
 immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in subparagraph (C)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in subparagraph (C); or




(ii)
 do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary may impose any of the remedies described in subparagraph (C).





Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a nursing facility’s deficiencies. If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.




(C)
 Specified remedies
The Secretary may take the following actions with respect to a finding that a facility has not met an applicable requirement:

section 1320a–7a(a) of this title
.






(II)
 Reduction of civil money penalties in certain circumstances
Subject to subclause (III), in the case where a facility self-reports and promptly corrects a deficiency for which a penalty was imposed under this clause not later than 10 calendar days after the date of such imposition, the Secretary may reduce the amount of the penalty imposed by not more than 50 percent.






(III)
 Prohibitions on reduction for certain deficiencies
(aa)
 Repeat deficiencies
The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the Secretary had reduced a penalty imposed on the facility in the preceding year under such subclause with respect to a repeat deficiency.






(bb)
 Certain other deficiencies
The Secretary may not reduce the amount of a penalty under subclause (II) if the penalty is imposed on the facility for a deficiency that is found to result in a pattern of harm or widespread harm, immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of a resident or residents of the facility, or results in the death of a resident of the facility.








(IV)
 Collection of civil money penalties
In the case of a civil money penalty imposed under this clause, the Secretary shall issue regulations that—
(aa)
 subject to item (cc), not later than 30 days after the imposition of the penalty, provide for the facility to have the opportunity to participate in an independent informal dispute resolution process which generates a written record prior to the collection of such penalty;




(bb)
 in the case where the penalty is imposed for each day of noncompliance, provide that a penalty may not be imposed for any day during the period beginning on the initial day of the imposition of the penalty and ending on the day on which the informal dispute resolution process under item (aa) is completed;

(dd)
 may provide that such amounts collected are kept in such account pending the resolution of any subsequent appeals;




(ee)
 in the case where the facility successfully appeals the penalty, may provide for the return of such amounts collected (plus interest) to the facility; and




(ff)
 in the case where all such appeals are unsuccessful, may provide that some portion of such amounts collected may be used to support activities that benefit residents, including assistance to support and protect residents of a facility that closes (voluntarily or involuntarily) or is decertified (including offsetting costs of relocating residents to home and community-based settings or another facility), projects that support resident and family councils and other consumer involvement in assuring quality care in facilities, and facility improvement initiatives approved by the Secretary (including joint training of facility staff and surveyors, technical assistance for facilities implementing quality assurance programs, the appointment of temporary management firms, and other activities approved by the Secretary).








(iii)
 Appointment of temporary management
In consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility’s residents, where there is a need for temporary management while—
(I)
 there is an orderly closure of the facility, or




(II)
 improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.







 The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the Secretary has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.



The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.

 Continuation of payments pending remediation
The Secretary may continue payments, over a period of not longer than 6 months after the effective date of the findings, under this subchapter with respect to a nursing facility not in compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, if—
(i)
 the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility, and




(ii)
 the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action.





The Secretary shall establish guidelines for approval of corrective actions requested by States under this subparagraph.






(4)

A finding to deny payment under this subsection shall terminate when the State or Secretary (or both, as the case may be) finds that the facility is in substantial compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.






(5)
 Immediate termination of participation for facility where State or Secretary finds noncompliance and immediate jeopardy
If either the State or the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the State or the Secretary, respectively 
7
7
 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma.
 shall notify the other of such finding, and the State or the Secretary, respectively, shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(A)(iii) or (3)(C)(iii), or terminate the facility’s participation under the State plan. If the facility’s participation in the State plan is terminated by either the State or the Secretary, the State shall provide for the safe and orderly transfer of the residents eligible under the State plan consistent with the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section.






(6)
 Special rules where State and Secretary do not agree on finding of noncompliance
(A)
 State finding of noncompliance and no secretarial finding of noncompliance
If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but a State finds that the facility has not met such requirements and the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State’s findings shall control and the remedies imposed by the State shall be applied.






(B)
 Secretarial finding of noncompliance and no State finding of noncompliance
If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that the failure does not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, but the State has not made such a finding, the Secretary—

 may impose any remedies specified in paragraph (3)(C) with respect to the facility, and




(ii)
 shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D).








(7)
 Special rules for timing of termination of participation where remedies overlap
If both the Secretary and the State find that a nursing facility has not met all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and neither finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents—
(A)
(i)
 if both find that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State’s timing of any termination shall control so long as the termination date does not occur later than 6 months after the date of the finding to terminate;




(ii)
 if the Secretary, but not the State, finds that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the Secretary shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D); or




(iii)
 if the State, but not the Secretary, finds that the facility’s participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State’s decision to terminate, and timing of such termination, shall control; and






(B)
(i)
 if the Secretary or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility’s participation under the State plan, such additional or alternative remedies shall also be applied, or




(ii)
 if both the Secretary and the State establish one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility’s participation under the State plan, only the additional or alternative remedies of the Secretary shall apply.








(8)

 Adjustment in payment for inpatient hospital services furnished by disproportionate share hospitals
(a)
 Implementation of requirement
(1)
 A State plan under this subchapter shall not be considered to meet the requirement of 
section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title
 (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs), as of 
July 1, 1988
, unless the State has submitted to the Secretary, by not later than such date, an amendment to such plan that—
(A)
 specifically defines the hospitals so described (and includes in such definition any disproportionate share hospital described in subsection (b)(1) of this section which meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section), and




(B)
 provides, effective for inpatient hospital services provided not later than 
July 1, 1988
, for an appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment for such services provided by such hospitals, consistent with subsection (c) of this section.






(2)
(A)
 In order to be considered to have met such requirement of 
section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title
 as of 
July 1, 1989
, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than 
April 1, 1989
, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsection (c) of this section, effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after 
July 1, 1989
.




(B)
 In order to be considered to have met such requirement of 
section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title
 as of 
July 1, 1990
, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than 
April 1, 1990
, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsections (c) and (f) of this section, effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after 
July 1, 1990
.




(C)
 If a State plan under this subchapter provides for payments for inpatient hospital services on a prospective basis (whether per diem, per case, or otherwise), in order for the plan to be considered to have met such requirement of 
section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title
 as of 
July 1, 1989
, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than 
April 1, 1989
, a State plan amendment that provides, in the case of hospitals defined by the State as disproportionate share hospitals under paragraph (1)(A), for an outlier adjustment in payment amounts for medically necessary inpatient hospital services provided on or after 
July 1, 1989
, involving exceptionally high costs or exceptionally long lengths of stay for individuals under one year of age.




(D)
 A State plan under this subchapter shall not be considered to meet the requirements of 
section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title
 (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients with special needs), as of 
October 1, 1998
, unless the State has submitted to the Secretary by such date a description of the methodology used by the State to identify and to make payments to disproportionate share hospitals, including children’s hospitals, on the basis of the proportion of low-income and medicaid patients (including such patients who receive benefits through a managed care entity) served by such hospitals. The State shall provide an annual report to the Secretary describing the disproportionate share payments to each such disproportionate share hospital.






(3)
 The Secretary shall, not later than 90 days after the date a State submits an amendment under this subsection, review each such amendment for compliance with such requirement and by such date shall approve or disapprove each such amendment. If the Secretary disapproves such an amendment, the State shall immediately submit a revised amendment which meets such requirement.




(4)
 The requirement of this subsection may not be waived under 
section 1396n(b)(4) of this title
.




(b)
 Hospitals deemed disproportionate share
(1)
 For purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section, a hospital which meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section is deemed to be a disproportionate share hospital if—
(A)
 the hospital’s medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (2)) is at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State; or




(B)
 the hospital’s low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (3)) exceeds 25 percent.






(2)
 For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term “medicaid inpatient utilization rate” means, for a hospital, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the hospital’s number of inpatient days attributable to patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter in a period (regardless of whether such patients receive medical assistance on a fee-for-service basis or through a managed care entity), and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital’s inpatient days in that period. In this paragraph, the term “inpatient day” includes each day in which an individual (including a newborn) is an inpatient in the hospital, whether or not the individual is in a specialized ward and whether or not the individual remains in the hospital for lack of suitable placement elsewhere.




(3)
 For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term “low-income utilization rate” means, for a hospital, the sum of—
(A)
 the fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(i)
 the numerator of which is the sum (for a period) of (I) the total revenues paid the hospital for patient services under a State plan under this subchapter (regardless of whether the services were furnished on a fee-for-service basis or through a managed care entity) and (II) the amount of the cash subsidies for patient services received directly from State and local governments, and




(ii)
 the denominator of which is the total amount of revenues of the hospital for patient services (including the amount of such cash subsidies) in the period; and






(B)
 a fraction (expressed as a percentage)—
(i)
 the numerator of which is the total amount of the hospital’s charges for inpatient hospital services which are attributable to charity care in a period, less the portion of any cash subsidies described in clause (i)(II) of subparagraph (A) in the period reasonably attributable to inpatient hospital services, and




(ii)
 the denominator of which is the total amount of the hospital’s charges for inpatient hospital services in the hospital in the period.







The numerator under subparagraph (B)(i) shall not include contractual allowances and discounts (other than for indigent patients not eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter).




(4)
 The Secretary may not restrict a State’s authority to designate hospitals as disproportionate share hospitals under this section. The previous sentence shall not be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary to reduce payments pursuant to 
section 1396b(w)(1)(A)(iii) of this title
 if the Secretary determines that, as a result of such designations, there is in effect a hold harmless provision described in 
section 1396b(w)(4) of this title
.




(c)
 Payment adjustment
Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, in order to be consistent with this subsection, a payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital must either—
(1)
 be in an amount equal to at least the product of (A) the amount paid under the State plan to the hospital for operating costs for inpatient hospital services (of the kind described in 
section 1395ww(a)(4) of this title
), and (B) the hospital’s disproportionate share adjustment percentage (established under 
section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(iv) of this title
);




(2)
 provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) and (without regard to whether the hospital is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section) for an increase in such a payment amount (or percentage payment) in proportion to the percentage by which the hospital’s medicaid utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section) exceeds one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State or the hospital’s low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph 
1
1
 So in original. Probably should be “subsection”.
 (b)(3) of this section); or




(3)
 provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) that varies according to type of hospital under a methodology that—
(A)
 applies equally to all hospitals of each type; and




(B)
 results in an adjustment for each type of hospital that is reasonably related to the costs, volume, or proportion of services provided to patients eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter or to low-income patients,







except that, for purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A) of subsection (a) of this section, the payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital is consistent with this subsection if the appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment is equal to at least one-third of the increase otherwise applicable under this subsection (in the case of such paragraph (1)(B)) and at least two-thirds of such increase (in the case of such paragraph (2)(A)). In the case of a hospital described in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section (relating to children’s hospitals), in computing the hospital’s disproportionate share ad­justment percentage for purposes of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the disproportionate patient percentage (defined in 
section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi) of this title
) shall be computed by substituting for the fraction described in subclause (I) of such section the fraction described in subclause (II) of that section. If a State elects in a State plan amendment under subsection (a) of this section to provide the payment adjustment described in paragraph (2), the State must include in the amendment a detailed description of the specific methodology to be used in determining the specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) to be made to each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and must publish at least annually the name of each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and the amount of such payment adjustment made for each such hospital.


(d)
 Requirements to qualify as disproportionate share hospital
(1)
 Except as provided in paragraph (2), no hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) of this section unless the hospital has at least 2 obstetricians who have staff privileges at the hospital and who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals who are entitled to medical assistance for such services under such State plan.




(2)
(A)
 Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a hospital—
(i)
 the inpatients of which are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age; or




(ii)
 which does not offer nonemergency obstetric services to the general population as of 
December 22, 1987
.






(B)
 In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (as defined for purposes of 
section 1395ww of this title
), in paragraph (1) the term “obstetrician” includes any physician with staff privileges at the hospital to perform nonemergency obstetric procedures.






(3)
 No hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) or (e) of this section unless the hospital has a medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section) of not less than 1 percent.




(e)
 Special rule
(1)
 A State plan shall be considered to meet the requirement of 
section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title
 (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs) without regard to the requirement of subsection (a) of this section if (A)(i) the plan provided for payment adjustments based on a pooling arrangement involving a majority of the hospitals participating under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals as of 
January 1, 1984
, or (ii) the plan as of 
January 1, 1987
, provided for payment adjustments based on a statewide pooling arrangement involving all acute care hospitals and the arrangement provides for reimbursement of the total amount of uncompensated care provided by each participating hospital, (B) the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for such hospitals is not less than the aggregate amount of such adjustments otherwise required to be made under such subsection, and (C) the plan meets the requirement of subsection (d)(3) of this section and such payment adjustments are made consistent with the last sentence of subsection (c) of this section.




(2)
 In the case of a State that used a health insuring organization before 
January 1, 1986
, to administer a portion of its plan on a statewide basis, beginning on 
July 1, 1988
—
(A)
 the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section (other than the last sentence of subsection (c) of this section) shall not apply if the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals (as defined under the State plan) is not less than the aggregate amount of payment adjustments otherwise required to be made if such subsections applied,




(B)
 subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section shall apply to hospitals located in urban areas, as well as in rural areas,




(C)
 subsection (d)(3) of this section shall apply, and




(D)
 subsection (g) of this section shall apply.






(f)
 Limitation on Federal financial participation
(1)
 In general
Payment under 
section 1396b(a) of this title
 shall not be made to a State with respect to any payment adjustment made under this section for hospitals in a State for quarters in a fiscal year in excess of the disproportionate share hospital (in this subsection referred to as “DSH”) allotment for the State for the fiscal year, as specified in paragraphs (2), (3), and (7).






(2)

 State DSH allotments for fiscal year 2003 and thereafter
(A)
 In general
Except as provided in paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) and subparagraph (E), the DSH allotment for any State for fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year is equal to the DSH allotment for the State for the preceding fiscal year under paragraph (2) or this paragraph, increased, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C) and paragraph (5), by the percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city average), for the previous fiscal year.






(B)
 Limitation
The DSH allotment for a State shall not be increased under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year to the extent that such an increase would result in the DSH allotment for the year exceeding the greater of—
(i)
 the DSH allotment for the previous year, or




(ii)
 12 percent of the total amount of expenditures under the State plan for medical assistance during the fiscal year.






(C)
 Special, temporary increase in allotments on a one-time, non-cumulative basis
The DSH allotment for any State (other than a State with a DSH allotment determined under paragraph (5))—
(i)
 for fiscal year 2004 is equal to 116 percent of the DSH allotment for the State for fiscal year 2003 under this paragraph, notwithstanding subparagraph (B); and




(ii)
 for each succeeding fiscal year is equal to the DSH allotment for the State for fiscal year 2004 or, in the case of fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year specified in subparagraph (D) for that State, the DSH allotment for the State for the previous fiscal year increased by the percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; U.S. city average), for the previous fiscal year.






(D)
 Fiscal year specified
For purposes of subparagraph (C)(ii), the fiscal year specified in this subparagraph for a State is the first fiscal year for which the Secretary estimates that the DSH allotment for that State will equal (or no longer exceed) the DSH allotment for that State under the law as in effect before 
December 8, 2003
.






(E)
 Temporary increase in allotments during recession
(i)
 In general

 Survey and certification process
(1)
 Certifications
(A)
 Responsibilities of the State
Under each State plan under this subchapter, the State shall be responsible for certifying the compliance of providers of home and community care and community care settings with the applicable requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this section. The failure of the Secretary to issue regulations to carry out this subsection shall not relieve a State of its responsibility under this subsection.






(B)
 Responsibilities of the Secretary
The Secretary shall be responsible for certifying the compliance of State providers of home and community care, and of State community care settings in which such care is provided, with the requirements of subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this section.

 Frequency of certifications
Certification of providers and settings under this subsection shall occur no less frequently than once every 12 months.








(2)
 Reviews of providers

(B)
 Special reviews of compliance
Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a provider of home or community care with any of the requirements of subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a review of the provider and, on the basis of that review, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the provider meets such requirements.








(3)
 Surveys of community care settings
(A)
 In general
The certification under this subsection with respect to community care settings must be based on a survey. Such survey for such a setting must be conducted without prior notice to the setting. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a community care setting of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of 
section 1320a–7a of this title
 (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under 
section 1320a–7a(a) of this title
. The Secretary shall review each State’s procedures for scheduling and conducting such surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.






(B)
 Survey protocol
Surveys under this paragraph shall be conducted based upon a protocol which the Secretary has provided for under subsection (k) of this section.






(C)
 Prohibition of conflict of interest in survey team membership

The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of community care settings in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under subparagraph (A) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State’s surveys conducted under subparagraph (A). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under subparagraph (B). If the State has determined that an individual setting meets the requirements of subsection (g) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the setting does not meet such requirements, the Secretary’s determination as to the setting’s noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.






(E)
 Special surveys of compliance
Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a community care setting with any of the requirements of subsection (g) or (h) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the setting and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the setting meets such requirements.








(4)
 Investigation of complaints and monitoring of providers and settings
Each State and the Secretary shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to investigate complaints of violations of applicable requirements imposed on providers of community care or on community care settings under subsections (f), (g) and (h) of this section.

The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that an individual has neglected or abused an individual receiving community care or misappropriated such individual’s property, the State shall notify the individual against whom the finding is made. A State shall not make a finding that a person has neglected an individual receiving community care if the person demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the person. The State shall provide for public disclosure of findings under this paragraph upon request and for inclusion, in any such disclosure of such findings, of any brief statement (or of a clear and accurate summary thereof) of the individual disputing such findings.

Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty under subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section) may be applied to reimbursement of individuals for personal funds lost due to a failure of home or community care providers to meet the requirements of this section. The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.






(ii)
 Deadline and guidance
Each State which elects to provide home and community care under this section must establish the civil money penalty remedy described in clause (i) applicable to all providers of community care covered under this section. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations or otherwise by not later than

If the Secretary finds that a provider meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C) for the period during which the Secretary finds that the provider was not in compliance with such requirements.






(C)
 Civil money penalty
If the Secretary finds on the basis of a review under subsection (i)(2) of this section or otherwise that a home or community care provider no longer meets the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of 
section 1320a–7a of this title
 (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under 
section 1320a–7a(a) of this title
. The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.
