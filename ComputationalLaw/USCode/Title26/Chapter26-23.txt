Chapter 23
FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX ACT
 Rate of tax
 Credits against tax
(a)
 Contributions to State unemployment funds
(1)
 The taxpayer may, to the extent provided in this subsection and subsection (c), credit against the tax imposed by section 3301 the amount of contributions paid by him into an unemployment fund maintained during the taxable year under the unemployment compensation law of a State which is certified as provided in section 3304 for the 12-month period ending on October 31 of such year.




(2)
 The credit shall be permitted against the tax for the taxable year only for the amount of contributions paid with respect to such taxable year.




(3)
 The credit against the tax for any taxable year shall be permitted only for contributions paid on or before the last day upon which the taxpayer is required under section 6071 to file a return for such year; except that credit shall be permitted for contributions paid after such last day, but such credit shall not exceed 90 percent of the amount which would have been allowable as credit on account of such contributions had they been paid on or before such last day.




(4)
 Upon the payment of contributions into the unemployment fund of a State which are required under the unemployment compensation law of that State with respect to remuneration on the basis of which, prior to such payment into the proper fund, the taxpayer erroneously paid an amount as contributions under another unemployment compensation law, the payment into the proper fund shall, for purposes of credit against the tax, be deemed to have been made at the time of the erroneous payment. If, by reason of such other law, the taxpayer was entitled to cease paying contributions with respect to services subject to such other law, the payment into the proper fund shall, for purposes of credit against the tax, be deemed to have been made on the date the return for the taxable year was filed under section 6071.




(5)
 In the case of wages paid by the trustee of an estate under title 11 of the United States Code, if the failure to pay contributions on time was without fault by the trustee, paragraph (3) shall be applied by substituting “100 percent” for “90 percent”.




(b)
 Additional credit
In addition to the credit allowed under subsection (a), a taxpayer may credit against the tax imposed by section 3301 for any taxable year an amount, with respect to the unemployment compensation law of each State certified as provided in section 3303 for the 12-month period ending on October 31 of such year, or with respect to any provisions thereof so certified, equal to the amount, if any, by which the contributions required to be paid by him with respect to the taxable year were less than the contributions such taxpayer would have been required to pay if throughout the taxable year he had been subject under such State law to the highest rate applied thereunder in such 12-month period to any person having individuals in his employ, or to a rate of 5.4 percent, whichever rate is lower.




(c)
 Limit on total credits
(1)
 The total credits allowed to a taxpayer under this section shall not exceed 90 percent of the tax against which such credits are allowable.




(2)
 If an advance or advances have been made to the unemployment account of a State under title XII of the Social Security Act, then the total credits (after applying subsections (a) and (b) and paragraph (1) of this subsection) otherwise allowable under this section for the taxable year in the case of a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of such State shall be reduced—
(A)
(i)
 in the case of a taxable year beginning with the second consecutive January 1 as of the beginning of which there is a balance of such advances, by 5 percent of the tax imposed by section 3301 with respect to the wages paid by such taxpayer during such taxable year which are attributable to such State; and




(ii)
 in the case of any succeeding taxable year beginning with a consecutive January 1 as of the beginning of which there is a balance of such advances, by an additional 5 percent, for each such succeeding taxable year, of the tax imposed by section 3301 with respect to the wages paid by such taxpayer during such taxable year which are attributable to such State;






(B)
 in the case of a taxable year beginning with the third or fourth consecutive January 1 as of the beginning of which there is a balance of such advances, by the amount determined by multiplying the wages paid by such taxpayer during such taxable year which are attributable to such State by the percentage (if any), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the State’s average annual wage in covered employment for the calendar year in which the determination is made and the denominator of which is the wage base under this chapter, by which—
(i)
 2.7 percent multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the wage base under this chapter and the denominator of which is the estimated United States average annual wage in covered employment for the calendar year in which the determination is to be made, exceeds




(ii)
 the average employer contribution rate for such State for the calendar year preceding such taxable year; and






(C)
 in the case of a taxable year beginning with the fifth or any succeeding consecutive January 1 as of the beginning of which there is a balance of such advances, by the amount determined by multiplying the wages paid by such taxpayer during such taxable year which are attributable to such State by the percentage (if any) by which—
(i)
 the 5-year benefit cost rate applicable to such State for such taxable year or (if higher) 2.7 percent, exceeds




(ii)
 the average employer contribution rate for such State for the calendar year preceding such taxable year.







The provisions of the preceding sentence shall not be applicable with respect to the taxable year beginning 
January 1, 1975
, or any succeeding taxable year which begins before 
January 1, 1980
; and, for purposes of such sentence, 
January 1, 1980
, shall be deemed to be the first January 1 occurring after 
January 1, 1974
, and consecutive taxable years in the period commencing 
January 1, 1980
, shall be determined as if the taxable year which begins on 
January 1, 1980
, were the taxable year immediately succeeding the taxable year which began on 
January 1, 1974
. Subparagraph (C) shall not apply with respect to any taxable year to which it would otherwise apply (but subparagraph (B) shall apply to such taxable year) if the Secretary of Labor determines (on or before November 10 of such taxable year) that the State meets the requirements of subsection (f)(2)(B) for such taxable year.




(3)
 If the Secretary of Labor determines that a State, or State agency, has not—
(A)
 entered into the agreement described in section 239 of the Trade Act of 1974, with the Secretary of Labor before 
July 15, 1975
, or




(B)
 fulfilled its commitments under an agreement with the Secretary of Labor as described in section 239 of the Trade Act of 1974,





then, in the case of a taxpayer subject to the unemployment compensation law of such State, the total credits (after applying subsections (a) and (b) and paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section) otherwise allowable under this section for a year during which such State or agency does not enter into or fulfill such an agreement shall be reduced by 7½ percent of the tax imposed with respect to wages paid by such taxpayer during such year which are attributable to such State.




(d)
 Definitions and special rules relating to subsection (c)
(1)
 Rate of tax deemed to be 6 percent
In applying subsection (c), the tax imposed by section 3301 shall be computed at the rate of 6 percent in lieu of the rate provided by such section.






(2)
 Wages attributable to a particular State
For purposes of subsection (c), wages shall be attributable to a particular State if they are subject to the unemployment compensation law of the State, or (if not subject to the unemployment compensation law of any State) if they are determined (under rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary) to be attributable to such State.






(3)
 Additional taxes inapplicable where advances are repaid before November 10 of taxable year
Paragraph (2) of subsection (c) shall not apply with respect to any State for the taxable year if (as of the beginning of November 10 of such year) there is no balance of advances referred to in such paragraph.






(4)
 Average employer contribution rate
For purposes of subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (c)(2), the average employer contribution rate for any State for any calendar year is that percentage obtained by dividing—

 the total of the contributions paid into the State unemployment fund with respect to such calendar year, by




(B)
(i)
 for purposes of subparagraph (B) of subsection (c)(2), the total of the wages (as determined without any limitation on amount) attributable to such State subject to contributions under this chapter with respect to such calendar year, and




(ii)
 for purposes of subparagraph (C) of subsection (c)(2), the total of the remuneration subject to contributions under the State unemployment compensation law with respect to such calendar year.







For purposes of subparagraph (C) of subsection (c)(2), if the average employer contribution rate for any State for any calendar year (determined without regard to this sentence) equals or exceeds 2.7 percent, such rate shall be determined by increasing the amount taken into account under subparagraph (A) of the preceding sentence by the aggregate amount of employee payments (if any) into the unemployment fund of such State with respect to such calendar year which are to be used solely in the payment of unemployment compensation.




(5)
 5-year benefit cost rate
For purposes of subparagraph (C) of subsection (c)(2), the 5-year benefit cost rate applicable to any State for any taxable year is that percentage obtained by dividing—
(A)
 one-fifth of the total of the compensation paid under the State unemployment compensation law during the 5-year period ending at the close of the second calendar year preceding such taxable year, by




(B)
 the total of the remuneration subject to contributions under the State unemployment compensation law with respect to the first calendar year preceding such taxable year.






(6)
 Rounding
If any percentage referred to in either subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (c)(2) is not a multiple of .1 percent, it shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of .1 percent.

(2)
 such other person is not an employer for the calendar year in which the acquisition takes place,





then, for the calendar year in which the acquisition takes place, in addition to the credits allowed under subsections (a) and (b), such employer may credit against the tax imposed by section 3301 for such year an amount equal to the credits which (without regard to subsection (c)) would have been allowable to such other person under subsections (a) and (b) and this subsection for such year, if such other person had been an employer, with respect to remuneration subject to contributions under the unemployment compensation law of a State paid by such other person to the individual or individuals described in paragraph (1).


(f)

(B)
 no State action was taken during the 12-month period ending on September 30 of such taxable year (excluding any action required under State law as in effect prior to the date of the enactment of this subsection) which has resulted or will result in a net decrease in the solvency of the State unemployment compensation system (as defined by the Secretary of Labor in regulations),

(2)
 If the Secretary of Labor finds that under the law of a single State (certified by the Secretary of Labor as provided in section 3304) more than one type of fund or account is maintained, and reduced rates of contributions to more than one type of fund or account were allowable with respect to any 12-month period ending on October 31, and one or more of such reduced rates were allowable under conditions not fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a), the Secretary of Labor shall, on such October 31, certify to the Secretary of the Treasury only those provisions of the State law pursuant to which reduced rates of contributions were allowable with respect to such 12-month period under conditions fulfilling the requirements of subsection (a), and shall, in connection therewith, designate the kind of fund or account, as defined in subsection (c), established by the provisions so certified. If the Secretary of Labor finds that a part of any reduced rate of contributions payable under such law or under such provisions is required to be paid into one fund or account and a part into another fund or account, the Secretary of Labor shall make such certification pursuant to this paragraph as he finds will assure the allowance of additional credits only with respect to that part of the reduced rate of contributions which is allowed under provisions which do fulfill the requirements of subsection (a).

 The Secretary of Labor shall, within 30 days after any State law is submitted to him for such purpose, certify to the State agency his findings with respect to reduced rates of contributions to a type of fund or account, as defined in subsection (c), which are allowable under such State law only in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a). After making such findings, the Secretary of Labor shall not withhold his certification to the Secretary of the Treasury of such State law, or of the provisions thereof with respect to which such findings were made, for any 12-month period ending on October 31 pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) unless, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, the Secretary of Labor finds the State law no longer contains the provisions specified in subsection (a) or the State has, with respect to such 12-month period, failed to comply substantially with any such provision.

(A)
 the payment was made because the employer, or an agent of the employer, was at fault for failing to respond timely or adequately to the request of the agency for information relating to the claim for compensation; and

Pub. L. 111–92
]), if such individual claimed extended compensation for at least 1 week of unemployment after the exhaustion of emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (b) (as such subsection was in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of this subsection [
Nov. 6, 2009

If a State determines that implementation of the increased entitlement to second-tier emergency unemployment compensation by reason of the amendments made by section 2 of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 [

If a State makes the election under the preceding sentence, then, for purposes of determining whether an account may be augmented for fourth-tier emergency unemployment compensation under subsection (e), such State shall treat the date of exhaustion of such increased second-tier emergency unemployment compensation as the date of exhaustion of third-tier emergency unemployment compensation, if such date is later than the date of exhaustion of the third-tier emergency unemployment compensation.

then the State shall determine eligibility for compensation as provided in paragraph (2).




“(2)
 For individuals described in paragraph (1), the State shall determine whether the individual is to be paid emergency unemployment compensation or regular compensation for a week of unemployment using one of the following methods:

“(B)
 The State shall, if permitted by State law, defer the establishment of a new benefit year (which uses all the wages and employment which would have been used to establish a benefit year but for the application of this paragraph), until exhaustion of all emergency unemployment compensation payable with respect to the benefit year referred to in paragraph(1)(A);




“(C)
 The State shall pay, if permitted by State law—
“(i)
 regular compensation equal to the weekly benefit amount established under the new benefit year, and




“(ii)
 emergency unemployment compensation equal to the difference between that weekly benefit amount and the weekly benefit amount for the expired benefit year; or

“(1)
 individuals whose workweeks have been reduced pursuant to a qualified employer plan by at least 10 per centum will be eligible for unemployment compensation;




“(2)
 the amount of unemployment compensation payable to any such individual shall be a pro rata portion of the unemployment compensation which would be payable to the individual if the individual were totally unemployed;

“(d)
 For purposes of subsection (c), the term ‘qualified employer plan’ means a plan of an employer or of an employers’ association which association is party to a collective bargaining agreement (hereinafter referred to as ‘employers’ association’) under which there is a reduction in the number of hours worked by employees rather than temporary layoffs if—
“(1)
 the employer’s or employers’ association’s short-time compensation plan is approved by the State agency;




“(2)
 the employer or employers’ association certifies to the State agency that the aggregate reduction in work hours pursuant to such plan is in lieu of temporary layoffs which would have affected at least 10 per centum of the employees in the unit or units to which the plan would apply and which would have resulted in an equivalent reduction of work hours;




“(3)
 during the previous four months the work force in the affected unit or units has not been reduced by temporary layoffs of more than 10 per centum;




“(4)
 the employer continues to provide health benefits, and retirement benefits under defined benefit pension plans (as defined in section 3(35) of the Employee Requirement Income Security Act of 1974 [

 the impact of the program upon the unemployment trust fund, and a comparison with the estimated impact on the fund of layoffs which would have occurred but for the existence of the program;




“(B)
 the extent to which the program has protected and preserved the jobs of workers, with special emphasis on newly hired employees, minorities, and women;




“(C)
 the extent to which layoffs occur in the unit subsequent to initiation of the program and the impact of the program upon the entitlement to unemployment compensation of the employees;




“(D)
 where feasible, the effect of varying methods of administration;




“(E)
 the effect of short-time compensation on employers’ State unemployment tax rates, including both users and nonusers of short-time compensation, on a State-by-State basis;




“(F)
 the effect of various State laws and practices under those laws on the retirement and health benefits of employees who are on short-time compensation programs;

Such report shall contain an evaluation of short-time compensation programs and shall contain such recommendations as the Secretary deems advisable, including recommendations as to necessary changes in the Statistical practices of the Department of Labor.”




“(a)
 [State Law Requirements] (1) For purposes of section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954], a State law shall provide the payment of extended compensation shall be made, for any week of unemployment which begins in the individual’s eligibility period, to individuals who have exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law and who have no rights to regular compensation with respect to such week under such law or any other State unemployment compensation law or to compensation under any other Federal law and are not receiving compensation with respect to such week under the unemployment compensation law of Canada. For purposes of the preceding sentence, an individual shall have exhausted his rights to regular compensation under a State law (A) when no payments of regular compensation can be made under such law because such individual has received all regular compensation available to him based on employment or wages during his base period, or (B) when his rights to such compensation have terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year with respect to which such rights existed.
“(2)
 Except where inconsistent with the provisions of this title, the terms and conditions of the State law which apply to claims for regular compensation and to the payment thereof shall apply to claims for extended compensation and to the payment thereof.




“(3)
(A)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), payment of extended compensation under this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under 
section 3311 of this title
] shall not be made to any individual for any week of unemployment in his eligibility period—
“(i)
 during which he fails to accept any offer of suitable work (as defined in subparagraph (c) [probably means subpar. (C)]) or fails to apply for any suitable work to which he was referred by the State agency; or




“(ii)
 during which he fails to actively engage in seeking work, unless such individual is not actively engaged in seeking work because such individual is, as determined in accordance with State law—
“(I)
 before any court of the United States or any State pursuant to a lawfully issued summons to appear for jury duty (as such term may be defined by the Secretary of Labor), or




“(II)
 hospitalized for treatment of an emergency or a life-threatening condition (as such term may be defined by such Secretary),





if such exemptions in clauses (I) and (II) apply to recipients of regular benefits, and the State chooses to apply such exemptions for recipients of extended benefits.






“(B)
 If any individual is ineligible for extended compensation for any week by reason of a failure described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A), the individual shall be ineligible to receive extended compensation for any week which begins during a period which—
“(i)
 begins with the week following the week in which such failure occurs, and




“(ii)
 does not end until such individual has been employed during at least 4 weeks which begin after such failure and the total of the remuneration earned by the individual for being so employed is not less than the product of 4 multiplied by the individual’s average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(c) [probably means subsec. (b)(1)(C)]) for his benefit year.






“(C)
 For purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘suitable work’ means, with respect to any individual, any work which is within such individual’s capabilities; except that, if the individual furnishes evidence satisfactory to the State agency that such individual’s prospects for obtaining work in his customary occupation within a reasonably short period are good, the determination of whether any work is suitable work with respect to such individual shall be made in accordance with the applicable State law.




“(D)
 Extended compensation shall not be denied under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) to any individual for any week by reason of a failure to accept an offer of, or apply for, suitable work—
“(i)
 if the gross average weekly remuneration payable to such individual for the position does not exceed the sum of—
“(I)
 the individual’s average weekly benefit amount (as determined for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(C)) for his benefit year, plus




“(II)
 the amount (if any) of supplemental unemployment compensation benefits (as defined in section 501(c)(17)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) payable to such individual for such week;






“(ii)
 if the position was not offered to such individual in writing and was not listed with the State employment service;




“(iii)
 if such failure would not result in a denial of compensation under the provisions of the applicable State law to the extent that such provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of subparagraphs (C) and (E); or




“(iv)
 if the position pays wages less than the higher of—
“(I)
 the minimum wage provided by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [
29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)
], without regard to any exemption; or




“(II)
 any applicable State or local minimum wage.








“(E)
 For purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be treated as actively engaged in seeking work during any week if—
“(i)
 the individual has engaged in a systematic and sustained effort to obtain work during such week, and




“(ii)
 the individual provides tangible evidence to the State agency that he has engaged in such an effort during such week.






“(F)
 For purposes of section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, a State law shall provide for referring applicants for benefits under this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under 
section 3311 of this title
] to any suitable work to which clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of subparagraph (D) would not apply.






“(4)
 No provision of State law which terminates a disqualification for voluntarily leaving employment, being discharged for misconduct, or refusing suitable employment shall apply for purposes of determining eligibility for extended compensation unless such termination is based upon employment subsequent to the date of such disqualification.




“(5)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2), an individual shall not be eligible for extended compensation unless, in the base period with respect to which the individual exhausted all rights to regular compensation under the State law, the individual had 20 weeks of full-time insured employment, or the equivalent in insured wages. For purposes of this paragraph, the equivalent in insured wages shall be earnings covered by the State law for compensation purposes which exceed 40 times the individual’s most recent weekly benefit amount or 1½ times the individual’s insured wages in that calendar quarter of the base period in which the individual’s insured wages were the highest (or one such quarter if his wages were the same for more than one such quarter). The State shall by law provide which one or more of the foregoing methods of measuring employment and earnings shall be used in that State.




“(6)
 No payment shall be made under this Act [see Short Title of 1970 Amendment note set out under 
section 3311 of this title
] to any State in respect of any extended compensation or sharable regular compensation paid to any individual for any week if, under the rules of paragraphs (3), (4), and (5), extended compensation would not have been payable to such individual for such week.




“(7)
 Paragraphs (3) and (4) shall not apply to weeks of unemployment beginning after 
March 6, 1993
, and before 
January 1, 1995
, and no provision of State law in conformity with such paragraphs shall apply during such period.




“(b)
 [Individual’s Compensation Accounts] (1) The State law shall provide that the State will establish, for each eligible individual who files an application therefor, an extended compensation account with respect to such individual’s benefit year. The amount established in such account shall be not less than whichever of the following is the least:
“(A)
 50 per centum of the total amount of regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) payable to him during such benefit year under such law,




“(B)
 thirteen times his average weekly benefit amount, or




“(C)
 thirty-nine times his average weekly benefit amount, reduced by the regular compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him during such benefit year under such law;





except that the amount so determined shall (if the State law so provides) be reduced by the aggregate amount of additional compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him under such law for prior weeks of unemployment in such benefit year which did not begin in an extended benefit period.


“(2)
 For purposes of paragraph (1), an individual’s weekly benefit amount for a week is the amount of regular compensation (including dependents’ allowances) under the State law payable to such individual for such week for total unemployment.




“(3)
(A)
 Effective with respect to weeks beginning in a high unemployment period, paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting—
“(i)
 ‘80 per centum’ for ‘50 per centum’ in subparagraph (A),




“(ii)
 ‘twenty’ for ‘thirteen’ in subparagraph (B), and




“(iii)
 ‘forty-six’ for ‘thirty-nine’ in subparagraph (C).






“(B)
 For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term ‘high unemployment period’ means any period during which an extended benefit period would be in effect if section 203(f)(1)(A)(i) were applied by substituting ‘8 percent’ for ‘6.5 percent’.






“(c)
 [Cessation of Extended Benefits When Paid Under an Interstate Claim in a State Where Extended Benefit Period Is Not in Effect] (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), payment of extended compensation shall not be made to any individual for any week if—
“(A)
 extended compensation would (but for this subsection) have been payable for such week pursuant to an interstate claim filed in any State under the interstate benefit payment plan, and




“(B)
 an extended benefit period is not in effect for such week in such State.




“(2)
 Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the first 2 weeks for which extended compensation is payable (determined without regard to this subsection) pursuant to an interstate claim filed under the interstate benefit payment plan to the individual from the extended compensation account established for the benefit year.




“(3)
 Section 3304(a)(9)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall not apply to any denial of compensation required under this subsection.




“(a)
 [Beginning and Ending] For purposes of this title, in the case of any State, an extended benefit period—
“(1)
 shall begin with the third week after the first week for which there is a State ‘on’ indicator; and




“(2)
 shall end with the third week after the first week for which there is a State ‘off’ indicator.




“(b)
 [Special Rules] (1) In the case of any State—
“(A)
 no extended benefit period shall last for a period of less than thirteen consecutive weeks, and




“(B)
 no extended benefit period may begin before the fourteenth week after the close of a prior extended benefit period with respect to such State.




“(2)
 When a determination has been made that an extended benefit period is beginning or ending with respect to a State, the Secretary shall cause notice of such determination to be published in the Federal Register.




“(c)
 [Eligibility Period] For purposes of this title, an individual’s eligibility period under the State law shall consist of the weeks in his benefit year which begin in an extended benefit period and, if his benefit year ends within such extended benefit period, any weeks thereafter which begin in such extended benefit period.


“(d)
 [State ‘On’ and ‘Off’ Indicators] For purposes of this section—
“(1)
 There is a State ‘on’ indicator for a week if the rate of insured unemployment under the State law for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding twelve weeks—
“(A)
 equaled or exceeded 120 per centum of the average of such rates for the corresponding thirteen-week period ending in each of the preceding two calendar years, and




“(B)
 equaled or exceeded 5 per centum.






“(2)
 There is a State ‘off’ indicator for a week if, for the period consisting of such week and the immediately preceding twelve weeks, either subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) is not satisfied.





Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after 
March 30, 1977
 (or, if later, the date established pursuant to State law), the State may by law provide that the determination of whether there has been a State ‘on’ or ‘off’ indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if (i) paragraph (1) did not contain subparagraph (A) thereof, and (ii) the figure ‘5’ contained in subparagraph (B) thereof were ‘6’; except that, notwithstanding any such provision of State law, any week for which there would otherwise be a State ‘on’ indicator shall continue to be such a week and shall not be determined to be a week for which there is a State ‘off’ indicator. Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after the date of enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 [
Dec. 17, 2010
] (or, if later, the date established pursuant to State law), and ending on or before 
December 31, 2013
, the State may by law provide that the determination of whether there has been a state [State] ‘on’ or ‘off’ indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if the word ‘two’ were ‘three’ in subparagraph (1)(A). For purposes of this subsection, the rate of insured unemployment for any thirteen-week period shall be determined by reference to the average monthly covered employment under the State law for the first four of the most recent six calendar quarters ending before the close of such period.


“(e)
 [Rate of Insured Unemployment; Covered Employment] (1) For purposes of subsection (d), the term ‘rate of insured unemployment’ means the percentage arrived at by dividing—
“(A)
 the average weekly number of individuals filing claims for regular compensation for weeks of unemployment with respect to the specified period, as determined on the basis of the reports made by the State agency to the Secretary, by




“(B)
 the average monthly covered employment for the specified period.




“(2)
 Determinations under subsection (d) shall be made by the State agency in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.




“(f)
 [Alternative Trigger] (1) Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after 
March 6, 1993
, the State may by law provide that for purposes of beginning or ending any extended benefit period under this section—
“(A)
 there is a State ‘on’ indicator for a week if—
“(i)
 the average rate of total unemployment in such State (seasonally adjusted) for the period consisting of the most recent 3 months for which data for all States are published before the close of such week equals or exceeds 6.5 percent, and




“(ii)
 the average rate of total unemployment in such State (seasonally adjusted) for the 3-month period referred to in clause (i) equals or exceeds 110 percent of such average rate for either (or both) of the corresponding 3-month periods ending in the 2 preceding calendar years; and






“(B)
 there is a State ‘off’ indicator for a week if either the requirements of clause (i) or clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) are not satisfied.





Notwithstanding the provision of any State law described in this paragraph, any week for which there would otherwise be a State ‘on’ indicator shall continue to be such a week and shall not be determined to be a week for which there is a State ‘off’ indicator.


“(2)
 Effective with respect to compensation for weeks of unemployment beginning after the date of enactment of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 [
Dec. 17, 2010
] (or, if later, the date established pursuant to State law), and ending on or before 
December 31, 2013
, the State may by law provide that the determination of whether there has been a state [State] ‘on’ or ‘off’ indicator beginning or ending any extended benefit period shall be made under this subsection as if the word ‘either’ were ‘any’, the word ‘both’ were ‘all’, and the figure ‘2’ were ‘3’ in clause (1)(A)(ii).




“(3)
 For purposes of this subsection, determinations of the rate of total unemployment in any State for any period (and of any seasonal adjustment) shall be made by the Secretary.




“(a)
 [Amount Payable] (1) There shall be paid to each State an amount equal to one-half of the sum of—
“(A)
 the sharable extended compensation, and




“(B)
 the sharable regular compensation,





paid to individuals under the State law.


“(2)
 No payment shall be made to any State under this subsection in respect of compensation (A) for which the State is entitled to reimbursement under the provisions of any Federal law other than this Act, (B) paid for the first week in an individual’s eligibility period for which extended compensation or sharable regular compensation is paid, if the State law of such State provides for payment (at any time or under any circumstances) of regular compensation to an individual for his first week of otherwise compensable unemployment, (C) paid for any week with respect to which such benefits are not payable by reason of section 233(d) [now 233(c)] of the Trade Act of 1974 [
19 U.S.C. 2293(c)
], or (D) paid to an individual with respect to a week of unemployment to the extent that such amount exceeds the amount of such compensation which would be paid to such individual if such State had a benefit structure which provided that the amount of compensation otherwise payable to any individual for any week shall be rounded (if not a full dollar amount) to the nearest lower full dollar amount.




“(3)
 The amount which, but for this paragraph, would be payable under this subsection to any State in respect of any compensation paid to an individual whose base period wages include wages for services to which section 3306(c)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 applies shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount which, but for this paragraph, would be payable under this subsection to such State in respect of such compensation as the amount of the base period wages attributable to such services bears to the total amount of the base period wages.




“(b)
 [Sharable Extended Compensation] For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(A), extended compensation paid to an individual for weeks of unemployment in such individual’s eligibility period is sharable extended compensation to the extent that the aggregate extended compensation paid to such individual with respect to any benefit year does not exceed the smallest of the amounts referred to in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 202(b)(1).


“(c)
 [Sharable Regular Compensation] For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(B), regular compensation paid to an individual for a week of unemployment is sharable regular compensation—
“(1)
 if such week is in such individual’s eligibility period (determined under section 203(c)), and




“(2)
 to the extent that the sum of such compensation, plus the regular compensation paid (or deemed paid) to him with respect to prior weeks of unemployment in the benefit year, exceeds twenty-six times (and does not exceed thirty-nine, forty-six in any case where section 202(b)(3)(A) applies[,] times) the average weekly benefit amount (including allowances for dependents) for weeks of total unemployment payable to such individual under the State law in such benefit year.




“(d)
 [Payment on Calendar Month Basis] There shall be paid to each State either in advance or by way of reimbursement, as may be determined by the Secretary, such sum as the Secretary estimates the State will be entitled to receive under this title for each calendar month, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum by which the Secretary finds that his estimates for any prior calendar month were greater or less than the amounts which should have been paid to the State. Such estimates may be made upon the basis of such statistical, sampling, or other method as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the State agency.


“(e)
 [Certification] The Secretary shall from time to time certify to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment to each State the sums payable to such State under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury, prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, shall make payment to the State in accordance with such certification, by transfers from the extended unemployment compensation account to the account of such State in the Unemployment Trust Fund.


“(b)
(1)
 In the case of a State law approved under section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, such State law may also provide that an extended benefit period may begin with a week established pursuant to such law which begins earlier than 
January 1, 1972
, but not earlier than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act [
Aug. 10, 1970
].




“(2)
 For purposes of paragraph (1) with respect to weeks beginning before 
January 1, 1972
, the extended benefit period for the State shall be determined under section 203(a) solely by reference to the State ‘on’ indicator and the State ‘off’ indicator.




“(3)
 In the case of a State law containing a provision described in paragraph (1), section 204 shall also apply with respect to weeks of unemployment in extended benefit periods determined pursuant to paragraph (1).




“(c)
 Section 3304(a)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by section 206) shall not be a requirement for the State law of any State—
“(1)
 in the case of any State the legislature of which does not meet in a regular session which closes during the calendar year 1971, with respect to any week of unemployment which begins prior to 
July 1, 1972
; or




“(2)
 in the case of any other State, with respect to any week of unemployment which begins prior to 
January 1, 1972
.




“(b)
 For the purposes of this section, the term ‘self-employment assistance program’ means a program as defined under section 3306(t) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, except as follows:
“(1)
 all references to ‘regular unemployment compensation under the State law’ shall be deemed to refer instead to ‘extended compensation under title II of the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970’ [this note];




“(2)
 paragraph (3)(B) shall not apply;




“(3)
 clause (i) of paragraph (3)(C) shall be deemed to state as follows:

“(4)
 the reference to ‘5 percent’ in paragraph (4) shall be deemed to refer instead to ‘1 percent’; and




“(5)
 paragraph (5) shall not apply.




“(c)
 In the case of an individual who is eligible to receive extended compensation under this title, such individual shall not receive self-employment assistance allowances under this section unless the State agency has a reasonable expectation that such individual will be entitled to at least 13 times the individual’s average weekly benefit amount of extended compensation and emergency unemployment compensation.


“(d)
(1)
 An individual who is participating in a self-employment assistance program established under this section may elect to discontinue participation in such program at any time.




“(2)
 For purposes of an individual whose participation in a self-employment assistance program established under this section is terminated pursuant to subsection (a)(3) or who has discontinued participation in such program, if the individual continues to satisfy the eligibility requirements for extended compensation under this title, the individual shall receive extended compensation payments with respect to subsequent weeks of unemployment, to the extent that amounts remain in the account established for such individual under section 202(b).”




“(a)
 The Secretary of Labor (hereinafter in this section referred to as the ‘Secretary’) may make loans to the Virgin Islands in such amounts as he determines to be necessary for the payment in any month of compensation under the unemployment compensation law of the Virgin Islands. A loan may be made under this subsection for the payment of compensation in any month only if—
“(1)
 the Governor of the Virgin Islands submits an application therefor no earlier than the first day of the preceding month; and




“(2)
 such application contains an estimate of the amount of the loan which will be required by the Virgin Islands for the payment of compensation in such month.




“(b)
 For purposes of this section—
“(1)
 an application for loan under subsection (a) shall be made on such forms and shall contain such information and data (fiscal and otherwise) concerning the operation and administration of the unemployment compensation law of the Virgin Islands as the Secretary deems necessary or relevant to the performance of his duties under this section;




“(2)
 the amount required by the Virgin Islands for the payment of compensation in any month shall be determined with due allowance for contingencies and taking into account all other amounts that will be available in the unemployment fund of the Virgin Islands for the payment of compensation in such month; and




“(3)
 the term ‘compensation’ means cash benefits payable to individuals with respect to their unemployment, exclusive of expenses of administration.




“(c)
 Any loan made under subsection (a) shall be repayable (without interest) not later than 
January 1, 1979
. If after 
January 1, 1979
, any portion of any such loan remains unpaid, the Virgin Islands shall pay interest thereon, until the loan is paid in full, at a rate equal to the rate of interest in effect under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [formerly I.R.C. 1954]. If at some future date the Federal Unemployment Tax Act [section 3301 et seq. of this title] shall be made applicable to the Virgin Islands, then, any amount of principal or interest due on any such loan remaining unpaid on such date shall be treated, for purposes of section 3302(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as an advance made to the Virgin Islands under title XII of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 1321
 et seq.].


“(d)
 No loan may be made under subsection (a) for any month beginning after 
September 30, 1977
. The aggregate of the loans which may be made under subsection (a) shall not exceed $15,000,000.


“(e)
 There are authorized to be appropriated from the general fund of the Treasury such sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.”


 Applicability of State law
(a)
 Interstate and foreign commerce
No person required under a State law to make payments to an unemployment fund shall be relieved from compliance therewith on the ground that he is engaged in interstate or foreign commerce, or that the State law does not distinguish between employees engaged in interstate or foreign commerce and those engaged in intrastate commerce.




(b)
 Federal instrumentalities in general
The legislature of any State may require any instrumentality of the United States (other than an instrumentality to which section 3306(c)(6) applies), and the individuals in its employ, to make contributions to an unemployment fund under a State unemployment compensation law approved by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 and (except as provided in section 5240 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (12 U.S.C., sec. 484), and as modified by subsection (c)), to comply otherwise with such law. The permission granted in this subsection shall apply (A) only to the extent that no discrimination is made against such instrumentality, so that if the rate of contribution is uniform upon all other persons subject to such law on account of having individuals in their employ, and upon all employees of such persons, respectively, the contributions required of such instrumentality or the individuals in its employ shall not be at a greater rate than is required of such other persons and such employees, and if the rates are determined separately for different persons or classes of persons having individuals in their employ or for different classes of employees, the determination shall be based solely upon unemployment experience and other factors bearing a direct relation to unemployment risk; (B) only if such State law makes provision for the refund of any contributions required under such law from an instrumentality of the United States or its employees for any year in the event such State is not certified by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 with respect to such year; and (C) only if such State law makes provision for the payment of unemployment compensation to any employee of any such instrumentality of the United States in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as unemployment compensation is payable to employees of other employers under the State unemployment compensation law.




(c)
 National banks
Nothing contained in section 5240 of the Revised Statutes, as amended (
12 U.S.C. 484
), shall prevent any State from requiring any national banking association to render returns and reports relative to the association’s employees, their remuneration and services, to the same extent that other persons are required to render like returns and reports under a State law requiring contributions to an unemployment fund. The Comptroller of the Currency shall, upon receipt of a copy of any such return or report of a national banking association from, and upon request of, any duly authorized official, body, or commission of a State, cause an examination of the correctness of such return or report to be made at the time of the next succeeding examination of such association, and shall thereupon transmit to such official, body, or commission a complete statement of his findings respecting the accuracy of such returns or reports.

(f)
 American vessels
The legislature of any State in which a person maintains the operating office, from which the operations of an American vessel operating on navigable waters within or within and without the United States are ordinarily and regularly supervised, managed, directed and controlled, may require such person and the officers and members of the crew of such vessel to make contributions to its unemployment fund under its State unemployment compensation law approved by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 and otherwise to comply with its unemployment compensation law with respect to the service performed by an officer or member of the crew on or in connection with such vessel to the same extent and with the same effect as though such service was performed entirely within such State. Such person and the officers and members of the crew of such vessel shall not be required to make contributions, with respect to such service, to the unemployment fund of any other State. The permission granted by this subsection is subject to the condition that such service shall be treated, for purposes of wage credits given employees, like other service subject to such State unemployment compensation law performed for such person in such State, and also subject to the same limitation, with respect to contributions required from such person and from the officers and members of the crew of such vessel, as is imposed by the second sentence (other than clause (B) thereof) of subsection (b) with respect to contributions required from instrumentalities of the United States and from individuals in their employ.




(g)
 Vessels operated by general agents of United States
The permission granted by subsection (f) shall apply in the same manner and under the same conditions (including the obligation to comply with all requirements of State unemployment compensation laws) to general agents of the Secretary of Commerce with respect to service performed by officers and members of the crew on or in connection with American vessels—
(1)
 owned by or bareboat chartered to the United States, and




(2)
 whose business is conducted by such general agents.





As to any such vessel, the State permitted to require contributions on account of such service shall be the State to which the general agent would make contributions if the vessel were operated for his own account. Such general agents are designated, for this purpose, instrumentalities of the United States neither wholly nor partially owned by it and shall not be exempt from the tax imposed by section 3301. The permission granted by this subsection is subject to the same conditions and limitations as are imposed in subsection (f), except that clause (B) of the second sentence of subsection (b) shall apply.


(h)
 Requirement by State of contributions
Any State may, as to service performed on account of which contributions are made pursuant to subsection (g)—
(1)
 require contributions from persons performing such service under its unemployment compensation law or temporary disability insurance law administered in connection therewith, and




(2)
 require general agents of the Secretary of Commerce to make contributions under such temporary disability insurance law and to make such deductions from wages or remuneration as are required by such unemployment compensation or temporary disability insurance law.




(i)
 General agent as legal entity
Each general agent of the Secretary of Commerce making contributions pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) shall, for purposes of such subsections, be considered a legal entity in his capacity as an instrumentality of the United States, separate and distinct from his identity as a person employing individuals on his own account.




(j)
 Denial of credits in certain cases
Any person required, pursuant to the permission granted by this section, to make contributions to an unemployment fund under a State unemployment compensation law approved by the Secretary of Labor under section 3304 shall not be entitled to the credits permitted, with respect to the unemployment compensation law of a State, by subsections (a) and (b) of section 3302 against the tax imposed by section 3301 for any taxable year if, on October 31 of such taxable year, the Secretary of Labor certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury his finding, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency, that the unemployment compensation law of such State is inconsistent with any one or more of the conditions on the basis of which such permission is granted or that, in the application of the State law with respect to the 12-month period ending on such October 31, there has been a substantial failure to comply with any one or more of such conditions. For purposes of section 3310, a finding of the Secretary of Labor under this subsection shall be treated as a finding under section 3304(c).
