(1)
 both any employee of an employer with 10 or less employees (determined without regard to section 414(e)(3)(C)) and any self-employed individual, or

 for fraud or other intentional misrepresentation of material fact by the employer;




(3)
 for noncompliance with material plan provisions;




(4)
 because the plan is ceasing to offer any coverage in a geographic area;

(6)
 for failure to meet the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, to renew a collective bargaining or other agreement requiring or authorizing contributions to the plan, or to employ employees covered by such an agreement.




(b)

(5)
 subject to subsection (c)(3), restrict benefits for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) in a manner which is less favorable than the benefits provided for any preceding portion of such stay.
