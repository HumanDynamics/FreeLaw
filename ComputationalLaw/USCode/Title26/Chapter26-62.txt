The part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived shall be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such installment. The part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary. This subsection shall not apply if the deficiency is due to negligence, to intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or to fraud with intent to evade tax.




(f)
 Time for payment of interest
If the time for payment of any amount of tax has been extended under this section—
(1)
 Interest for first 5 years
Interest payable under section 6601 of any unpaid portion of such amount attributable to the first 5 years after the date prescribed by section 6151(a) for payment of the tax shall be paid annually.






(2)
 Interest for periods after first 5 years
Interest payable under section 6601 on any unpaid portion of such amount attributable to any period after the 5-year period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be paid annually at the same time as, and as a part of, each installment payment of the tax.






(3)
 Interest in the case of certain deficiencies
In the case of a deficiency to which subsection (e) applies which is assessed after the close of the 5-year period referred to in paragraph (1), interest attributable to such 5-year period, and interest assigned under paragraph (2) to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived on or before the date of the assessment of the deficiency, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.






(4)
 Selection of shorter period
If the executor has selected a period shorter than 5 years under subsection (a)(3), such shorter period shall be substituted for 5 years in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection.

(i)
(I)
 any portion of an interest in a closely held business which qualifies under subsection (a)(1) is distributed, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of, or




(II)
 money and other property attributable to such an interest is withdrawn from such trade or business, and






(ii)
 the aggregate of such distributions, sales, exchanges, or other dispositions and withdrawals equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of such interest,





then the extension of time for payment of tax provided in subsection (a) shall cease to apply, and the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.




(B)
 In the case of a distribution in redemption of stock to which section 303 (or so much of section 304 as relates to section 303) applies—
(i)
 the redemption of such stock, and the withdrawal of money and other property distributed in such redemption, shall not be treated as a distribution or withdrawal for purposes of subparagraph (A), and




(ii)
 for purposes of subparagraph (A), the value of the interest in the closely held business shall be considered to be such value reduced by the value of the stock redeemed.





This subparagraph shall apply only if, on or before the date prescribed by subsection (a)(3) for the payment of the first installment which becomes due after the date of the distribution (or, if earlier, on or before the day which is 1 year after the date of the distribution), there is paid an amount of the tax imposed by section 2001 not less than the amount of money and other property distributed.




(C)
 Subparagraph (A)(i) does not apply to an exchange of stock pursuant to a plan of reorganization described in subparagraph (D), (E), or (F) of section 368(a)(1) nor to an exchange to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies; but any stock received in such an exchange shall be treated for purposes of subparagraph (A)(i) as an interest qualifying under subsection (a)(1).




(D)
 Subparagraph (A)(i) does not apply to a transfer of property of the decedent to a person entitled by reason of the decedent’s death to receive such property under the decedent’s will, the applicable law of descent and distribution, or a trust created by the decedent.

(i)
 any disposition of any interest in such stock in such holding company which was included in determining the gross estate of the decedent, or




(ii)
 any withdrawal of any money or other property from such holding company attributable to any interest included in determining the gross estate of the decedent,

(i)
 any disposition of any interest in such stock in the business company by such holding company, or




(ii)
 any withdrawal of any money or other property from such business company attributable to such stock by such holding company owning such stock,

 If an election is made under this section and the estate has undistributed net income for any taxable year ending on or after the due date for the first installment, the executor shall, on or before the date prescribed by law for filing the income tax return for such taxable year (including extensions thereof), pay an amount equal to such undistributed net income in liquidation of the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments.




(B)
 For purposes of subparagraph (A), the undistributed net income of the estate for any taxable year is the amount by which the distributable net income of the estate for such taxable year (as defined in section 643) exceeds the sum of—
(i)
 the amounts for such taxable year specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 661(a) (relating to deductions for distributions, etc.);




(ii)
 the amount of tax imposed for the taxable year on the estate under chapter 1; and




(iii)
 the amount of the tax imposed by section 2001 (including interest) paid by the executor during the taxable year (other than any amount paid pursuant to this paragraph).






(C)
 For purposes of this paragraph, if any stock in a corporation is treated as stock in another corporation by reason of subsection (b)(8)(A), any dividends paid by such other corporation to the corporation shall be treated as paid to the estate of the decedent to the extent attributable to the stock qualifying under subsection (a)(1).






(3)
 Failure to make payment of principal or interest
(A)
 In general
Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if any payment of principal or interest under this section is not paid on or before the date fixed for its payment by this section (including any extension of time), the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.

(i)
 the provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not apply with respect to such payment,




(ii)
 the provisions of section 6601(j) shall not apply with respect to the determination of interest on such payment, and




(iii)
 there is imposed a penalty in an amount equal to the product of—
(I)
 5 percent of the amount of such payment, multiplied by




(II)
 the number of months (or fractions thereof) after such date and before payment is made.







The penalty imposed under clause (iii) shall be treated in the same manner as a penalty imposed under subchapter B of chapter 68.






(h)

If—
(A)
 a deficiency in the tax imposed by section 2001 is assessed,




(B)
 the estate qualifies under subsection (a)(1), and

 Extension of time for payment of tax attributable to recovery of foreign expropriation losses
(a)
 Extension allowed by election
If—
(1)
 a corporation has a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which section 1351 applies, and




(2)
 the portion of the recovery received in money is less than 25 percent of the amount of such recovery (as defined in section 1351(c)) and is not greater than the tax attributable to such recovery,





the tax attributable to such recovery shall, at the election of the taxpayer, be payable in 10 equal installments on the 15th day of the third month of each of the taxable years following the taxable year of the recovery. Such election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations. If an election is made under this subsection, the provisions of this subtitle shall apply as though the Secretary were extending the time for payment of such tax.


(b)
 Extension permitted by Secretary
If a corporation has a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss to which section 1351 applies and if an election is not made under subsection (a), the Secretary may, upon finding that the payment of the tax attributable to such recovery at the time otherwise provided in this subtitle would result in undue hardship, extend the time for payment of such tax for a reasonable period or periods not in excess of 9 years from the date on which such tax is otherwise payable.




(c)
 Acceleration of payments
If—
(1)
 an election is made under subsection (a),




(2)
 during any taxable year before the tax attributable to such recovery is paid in full—
(A)
 any property (other than money) received on such recovery is sold or exchanged, or




(B)
 any property (other than money) received on any sale or exchange described in subparagraph (A) is sold or exchanged, and






(3)
 the amount of money received on such sale or exchange (reduced by the amount of the tax imposed under chapter 1 with respect to such sale or exchange), when added to the amount of money—
(A)
 received on such recovery, and




(B)
 received on previous sales or exchanges described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) (as so reduced),





exceeds the amount of money which may be received under subsection (a)(2),





an amount of the tax attributable to such recovery equal to such excess shall be payable on the 15th day of the third month of the taxable year following the taxable year in which such sale or exchange occurs. The amount of such tax so paid shall be treated, for purposes of this section, as a payment of the first unpaid installment or installments (or portion thereof) which become payable under subsection (a) following such taxable year.


(d)
 Proration of deficiency to installments
If an election is made under subsection (a), and a deficiency attributable to the recovery of a foreign expropriation loss has been assessed, the deficiency shall be prorated to such installments. The part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived shall be collected at the same time as, and as part of, such installment. The part of the deficiency so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary. This subsection shall not apply if the deficiency is due to negligence, to intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or to fraud with intent to evade tax.




(e)
 Time for payment of interest
If the time for payment for any amount of tax has been extended under this section, interest payable under section 6601 on any unpaid portion of such amount shall be paid annually at the same time as, and as part of, each installment payment of the tax. Interest, on that part of a deficiency prorated under this section to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived, for the period before the date fixed for the last installment preceding the assessment of the deficiency, shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.




(f)
 Tax attributable to recovery of foreign expropriation loss
For purposes of this section, the tax attributable to a recovery of a foreign expropriation loss is the sum of—
(1)
 the additional tax imposed by section 1351(d)(1) on such recovery, and




(2)
 the amount by which the tax imposed under subtitle A is increased by reason of the gain on such recovery which under section 1351(e) is considered as gain on the involuntary conversion of property.




(g)
 Failure to pay installment
If any installment under this section is not paid on or before the date fixed for its payment by this section (including any extension of time for the payment of such installment), the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.
