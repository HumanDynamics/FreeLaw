 the numerator of which is the adjusted GST exemption, and




(B)
 the denominator of which is the value of all of the property in such trust immediately after the termination of the charitable lead annuity.






(2)
 Adjusted GST exemption
For purposes of paragraph (1), the adjusted GST exemption is an amount equal to the GST exemption allocated to the trust increased by interest determined—
(A)
 at the interest rate used in determining the amount of the deduction under section 2055 or 2522 (as the case may be) for the charitable lead annuity, and




(B)
 for the actual period of the charitable lead annuity.

(f)
 Special rules for certain inter vivos transfers
Except as provided in regulations—
(1)
 In general
For purposes of determining the inclusion ratio, if—
(A)
 an individual makes an inter vivos transfer of property, and




(B)
 the value of such property would be includible in the gross estate of such individual under chapter 11 if such individual died immediately after making such transfer (other than by reason of section 2035),





any allocation of GST exemption to such property shall not be made before the close of the estate tax inclusion period (and the value of such property shall be determined under paragraph (2)). If such transfer is a direct skip, such skip shall be treated as occurring as of the close of the estate tax inclusion period.




(2)
 Valuation
In the case of any property to which paragraph (1) applies, the value of such property shall be—
(A)
 if such property is includible in the gross estate of the transferor (other than by reason of section 2035), its value for purposes of chapter 11, or




(B)
 if subparagraph (A) does not apply, its value as of the close of the estate tax inclusion period (or, if any allocation of GST exemption to such property is not made on a timely filed gift tax return for the calendar year in which such period ends, its value as of the time such allocation is filed with the Secretary).






(3)
 Estate tax inclusion period
For purposes of this subsection, the term “estate tax inclusion period” means any period after the transfer described in paragraph (1) during which the value of the property involved in such transfer would be includible in the gross estate of the transferor under chapter 11 if he died.

(A)
 the date on which there is a generation-skipping transfer with respect to such property, or




(B)

Such regulations shall include procedures for requesting comparable relief with respect to transfers made before the date of the enactment of this paragraph.




(B)
 Basis for determinations
In determining whether to grant relief under this paragraph, the Secretary shall take into account all relevant circumstances, including evidence of intent contained in the trust instrument or instrument of transfer and such other factors as the Secretary deems relevant. For purposes of determining whether to grant relief under this paragraph, the time for making the allocation (or election) shall be treated as if not expressly prescribed by statute.








(2)
 Substantial compliance
An allocation of GST exemption under section 2632 that demonstrates an intent to have the lowest possible inclusion ratio with respect to a transfer or a trust shall be deemed to be an allocation of so much of the transferor’s unused GST exemption as produces the lowest possible inclusion ratio.

(2)
 On spouse’s side
An individual who is a lineal descendant of a grandparent of a spouse (or former spouse) of the transferor (other than such spouse) shall be assigned to that generation which results from comparing the number of generations between such grandparent and such individual with the number of generations between such grandparent and such spouse.

 Special rule for persons with a deceased parent
(1)
 In general

(B)
 such individual’s parent who is a lineal descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) is dead at the time the transfer (from which an interest of such individual is established or derived) is subject to a tax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 upon the transferor (and if there shall be more than 1 such time, then at the earliest such time),





such individual shall be treated as if such individual were a member of the generation which is 1 generation below the lower of the transferor’s generation or the generation assignment of the youngest living ancestor of such individual who is also a descendant of the parent of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse), and the generation assignment of any descendant of such individual shall be adjusted accordingly.




(2)
 Limited application of subsection to collateral heirs
This subsection shall not apply with respect to a transfer to any individual who is not a lineal descendant of the transferor (or the transferor’s spouse or former spouse) if, at the time of the transfer, such transferor has any living lineal descendant.

(2)
 Gift-splitting by married couples
If, under section 2513, one-half of a gift is treated as made by an individual and one-half of such gift is treated as made by the spouse of such individual, such gift shall be so treated for purposes of this chapter.






(3)
 Special election for qualified terminable interest property
In the case of—
(A)
 any trust with respect to which a deduction is allowed to the decedent under section 2056 by reason of subsection (b)(7) thereof, and




(B)
 any trust with respect to which a deduction to the donor spouse is allowed under section 2523 by reason of subsection (f) thereof,





the estate of the decedent or the donor spouse, as the case may be, may elect to treat all of the property in such trust for purposes of this chapter as if the election to be treated as qualified terminable interest property had not been made.




(b)
 Trust and trustee
(1)
 Trust
The term “trust” includes any arrangement (other than an estate) which, although not a trust, has substantially the same effect as a trust.

(3)
 Examples
Arrangements to which this subsection applies include arrangements involving life estates and remainders, estates for years, and insurance and annuity contracts.






(c)
 Interest
(1)
 In general

 has a right (other than a future right) to receive income or corpus from the trust,




(B)
 is a permissible current recipient of income or corpus from the trust and is not described in section 2055(a), or

(3)
 Certain support obligations disregarded
The fact that income or corpus of the trust may be used to satisfy an obligation of support arising under State law shall be disregarded in determining whether a person has an interest in the trust, if—

 such use is discretionary, or




(B)
 such use is pursuant to the provisions of any State law substantially equivalent to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act.






(d)
 Executor
For purposes of this chapter, the term “executor” has the meaning given such term by section 2203.




 Taxation of multiple skips
(a)
 General rule
For purposes of this chapter, if—
(1)
 there is a generation-skipping transfer of any property, and




(2)
 immediately after such transfer such property is held in trust,





for purposes of applying this chapter (other than section 2651) to subsequent transfers from the portion of such trust attributable to such property, the trust will be treated as if the transferor of such property were assigned to the first generation above the highest generation of any person who has an interest in such trust immediately after the transfer.


(b)
 Trust retains inclusion ratio
(1)
 In general
Except as provided in paragraph (2), the provisions of subsection (a) shall not affect the inclusion ratio determined with respect to any trust. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, proper adjustment shall be made to the inclusion ratio with respect to such trust to take into account any tax under this chapter borne by such trust which is imposed by this chapter on the transfer described in subsection (a).






(2)
 Special rule for pour-over trust
(A)
 In general
If the generation-skipping transfer referred to in subsection (a) involves the transfer of property from 1 trust to another trust (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as the “pour-over trust”), the inclusion ratio for the pour-over trust shall be determined by treating the nontax portion of such distribution as if it were a part of a GST exemption allocated to such trust.






(B)
 Nontax portion
For purposes of subparagraph (A), the nontax portion of any distribution is the amount of such distribution multiplied by the applicable fraction which applies to such distribution.








 Special rules
(a)
 Basis adjustment
(1)
 In general
Except as provided in paragraph (2), if property is transferred in a generation-skipping transfer, the basis of such property shall be increased (but not above the fair market value of such property) by an amount equal to that portion of the tax imposed by section 2601 (computed without regard to section 2604) with respect to the transfer which is attributable to the excess of the fair market value of such property over its adjusted basis immediately before the transfer. The preceding shall be applied after any basis adjustment under section 1015 with respect to the transfer.






(2)
 Certain transfers at death
If property is transferred in a taxable termination which occurs at the same time as and as a result of the death of an individual, the basis of such property shall be adjusted in a manner similar to the manner provided under section 1014(a); except that, if the inclusion ratio with respect to such property is less than 1, any increase or decrease in basis shall be limited by multiplying such increase or decrease (as the case may be) by the inclusion ratio.






(b)
 Certain trusts treated as separate trusts
For purposes of this chapter—
(1)
 the portions of a trust attributable to transfers from different transferors shall be treated as separate trusts, and




(2)
 substantially separate and independent shares of different beneficiaries in a trust shall be treated as separate trusts.





Except as provided in the preceding sentence, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as authorizing a single trust to be treated as 2 or more trusts. For purposes of this subsection, a trust shall be treated as part of an estate during any period that the trust is so treated under section 645.


(c)
 Disclaimers
For provisions relating to the effect of a qualified disclaimer for purposes of this chapter, see section 2518.




(d)
 Limitation on personal liability of trustee
A trustee shall not be personally liable for any increase in the tax imposed by section 2601 which is attributable to the fact that—
(1)
 section 2642(c) (relating to exemption of certain nontaxable gifts) does not apply to a transfer to the trust which was made during the life of the transferor and for which a gift tax return was not filed, or




(2)
 the inclusion ratio with respect to the trust is greater than the amount of such ratio as computed on the basis of the return on which was made (or was deemed made) an allocation of the GST exemption to property transferred to such trust.





The preceding sentence shall not apply if the trustee has knowledge of facts sufficient reasonably to conclude that a gift tax return was required to be filed or that the inclusion ratio was erroneous.


 Administration
 Return requirements
(a)
 In general
The Secretary shall prescribe by regulations the person who is required to make the return with respect to the tax imposed by this chapter and the time by which any such return must be filed. To the extent practicable, such regulations shall provide that—

(2)
 the return shall be filed—
(A)
 in the case of a direct skip (other than from a trust), on or before the date on which an estate or gift tax return is required to be filed with respect to the transfer, and
