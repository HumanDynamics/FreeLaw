(2)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section—
(A)
 the authority to pledge assets of the Postal Service under this subsection shall be available only to the extent that such assets are not related to the provision of competitive products (as determined under section 2011(h) or, for purposes of any period before accounting practices and principles under section 2011(h) have been established and applied, the best information available from the Postal Service, including the audited statements required by section 2008(e)); and

The Secretary may elect to purchase such obligations under such terms, including rates of interest, as he and the Postal Service may agree, but at a rate of yield no less than the prevailing yield on outstanding marketable Treasury securities of comparable maturity, as determined by the Secretary. If the Secretary does not purchase such obligations, the Postal Service may proceed to issue and sell them to a party or parties other than the Secretary upon notice to the Secretary and upon consultation as to the date of issuance, maximum rates of interest, and other terms and conditions.


(b)
 Subject to the conditions of subsection (a) of this section, the Postal Service may require the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase obligations of the Postal Service under section 2005 in such amounts as will not cause the holding by the Secretary of the Treasury resulting from such required purchases to exceed $2,000,000,000 at any one time. This subsection shall not be construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to purchase obligations of the Postal Service under section 2005 in excess of such amount.


(c)
 Notwithstanding section 2005(d)(5) or 2011(e)(4)(E) of this title, obligations issued by the Postal Service shall be obligations of the Government of the United States, and payment of principal and interest thereon shall be fully guaranteed by the Government of the United States, such guaranty being expressed on the face thereof, if and to the extent that—

(2)
 the Secretary, in his discretion, determines that it would be in the public interest to do so.




 Public debt character of the obligations of the Postal Service
For the purpose of any purchase of the obligations of the Postal Service, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31, as now or hereafter in force, are extended to include any purchases of the obligations of the Postal Service under this chapter.

(d)
 Nothing in this section shall be construed as denying to the Postal Service the power to obtain audits of the accounts of the Postal Service and reports concerning its financial condition and operations by certified public accounting firms. Such audits and reports shall be in addition to those required by this section.


(e)
 At least once each year beginning with the fiscal year commencing after

The budget program shall be a business-type budget, or plan of operations, with due allowance given to the need for flexibility, including provision for emergencies and contingencies, in order that the Postal Service may properly carry out its activities as authorized by law. The budget program shall contain estimates of the financial condition and operations of the Postal Service for the current and ensuing fiscal years and the actual condition and results of operation for the last completed fiscal year. Such budget program shall include a statement of financial condition, a statement of income and expense, an analysis of surplus or deficit, a statement of sources and application of funds, and such other supplementary statements and information as are necessary or desirable to make known the financial condition and operations of the Postal Service.
