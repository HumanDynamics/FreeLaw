 the economic effects of widespread and increased drought frequency in the south, midwest, and plains States; and




(E)
 changes in pest problems due to higher temperatures.






(2)
 Further studies
If the results of the study conducted under paragraph (1) warrant, the Secretary shall conduct further studies that address the means of mitigating the effects of global climate change on crops of economic significance that shall, at a minimum—
(A)
 identify whether climate change tolerance can be bred into these crops, the amount of time necessary for any such breeding, and the effects on the income of farmers;




(B)

(C)
 assess the potential for the development of crop varieties that are tolerant to climate changes and other environmental stresses, such as drought, pests, and salinity.






(b)
 Forests
The Secretary shall conduct a study on the emissions of methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrocarbons from tropical and temperate forests, the manner in which such emissions may affect global climate change; the manner in which global climate change may affect such emissions; and the manner in which such emissions may be reduced through management practices. The study shall, at a minimum—

 identify and address alternative management strategies for temperate and tropical forests that may mitigate any negative effects of global climate change.




(c)
 Reports
The Secretary shall submit reports of the studies conducted under subsections (a) and (b) of this section within 3 and 6 years, respectively, after 
November 28, 1990
, to the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives, and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate. In addition, interim reports regarding such studies shall be provided by the Secretary to such Committees annually, with recommendations for actions which may be taken to mitigate the negative effects of global climate change and to adapt to global climate changes and related phenomena.
