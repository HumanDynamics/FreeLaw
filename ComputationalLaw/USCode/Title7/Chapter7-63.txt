Chapter 63
FARMER–TO–CONSUMER DIRECT MARKETING
 Congressional statement of purpose
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote, through appropriate means and on an economically sustainable basis, the development and expansion of direct marketing of agricultural commodities from farmers to consumers. To accomplish this objective, the Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter referred to as the “Secretary”) shall initiate and coordinate a program designed to facilitate direct marketing from farmers to consumers for the mutual benefit of consumers and farmers.
 Definitions
For purposes of this chapter, the term “direct marketing from farmers to consumers” shall mean the marketing of agricultural commodities at any marketplace (including, but not limited to, roadside stands, city markets, and vehicles used for house-to-house marketing of agricultural commodities) established and maintained for the purpose of enabling farmers to sell (either individually or through a farmers’ organization directly representing the farmers who produced the commodities being sold) their agricultural commodities directly to individual consumers, or organizations representing consumers, in a manner calculated to lower the cost and increase the quality of food to such consumers while providing increased financial returns to the farmers.
 Survey
The Secretary shall provide, through the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, or whatever agency or agencies the Secretary considers appropriate, an annual survey of existing methods of direct marketing from farmers to consumers in each State.
