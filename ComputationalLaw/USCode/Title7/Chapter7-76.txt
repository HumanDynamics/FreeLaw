Chapter 76
DAIRY RESEARCH AND PROMOTION
 Congressional findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 Congress finds that—
(1)
 dairy products are basic foods that are a valuable part of the human diet;




(2)
 the production of dairy products plays a significant role in the Nation’s economy, the milk from which dairy products are manufactured is produced by thousands of milk producers, and dairy products are consumed by millions of people throughout the United States;




(3)
 dairy products must be readily available and marketed efficiently to ensure that the people of the United States receive adequate nourishment;




(4)
 the maintenance and expansion of existing markets for dairy products are vital to the welfare of milk producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and producing dairy products, as well as to the general economy of the Nation; and




(5)
 dairy products move in interstate and foreign commerce, and dairy products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce of dairy products.




(b)
 It, therefore, is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided herein, of an orderly procedure for financing (through assessments on all milk produced in the United States for commercial use and on imported dairy products) and carrying out a coordinated program of promotion designed to strengthen the dairy industry’s position in the marketplace and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for fluid milk and dairy products. Nothing in this subchapter may be construed to provide for the control of production or otherwise limit the right of individual milk producers to produce milk or the right of any person to import dairy products.

 shall be certified by the Secretary. The Secretary shall certify any organization that the Secretary determines meets the eligibility criteria established by the Secretary under this section and the Secretary’s determination as to eligibility shall be final.

 functions of the organization; and




(6)

 Requirement of referendum
(a)
 Within the sixty-day period immediately preceding 
September 30, 1985
, the Secretary shall conduct a referendum among producers who, during a representative period (as determined by the Secretary), have been engaged in the production of milk for commercial use for the purpose of ascertaining whether the order then in effect shall be continued. Such order shall be continued only if the Secretary determines that it has been approved by not less than a majority of the producers voting in the referendum, who during a representative period (as determined by the Secretary) have been engaged in the production of milk for commercial use. If continuation of the order is not approved by a majority of the producers voting in the referendum, the Secretary shall terminate collection of assessments under the order within six months after the Secretary determines that such action is favored by a majority of the producers voting in the referendum and shall terminate the order in an orderly manner as soon as practicable after such determination.

 Referendum
After 
September 30, 1985
, the Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time, and shall hold a referendum on request of a representative group comprising 10 per centum or more of the number of producers and importers subject to the order, to determine whether the producers and importers favor the termination or suspension of the order. The Secretary shall suspend or terminate collection of assessments under the order within six months after the Secretary determines that suspension or termination of the order is favored by a majority of the producers voting in the referendum who, during a representative period (as determined by the Secretary), have been engaged in the production of milk for commercial use and importers voting in the referendum (who have been engaged in the importation of dairy products during the same representative period, as determined by the Secretary) and shall terminate the order in an orderly manner as soon as practicable after such determination.




(c)
 Action not considered an order
The termination or suspension of any order, or any provision thereof, shall not be considered an order within the meaning of this subchapter.




 Cooperative association representation
Whenever, under the provisions of this subchapter, the Secretary is required to determine the approval or disapproval of producers, the Secretary shall consider the approval or disapproval by any cooperative association of producers, engaged in a bona fide manner in marketing milk or the products thereof, as the approval or disapproval of the producers who are members of or under contract with such cooperative association of producers. If a cooperative association of producers elects to vote on behalf of its members, such cooperative association shall provide each producer, on whose behalf the cooperative association is expressing approval or disapproval, a description of the question presented in the referendum together with a statement of the manner in which the cooperative association intends to cast its vote on behalf of the membership.

After such hearing, the Secretary shall make a ruling on the petition, which shall be final if in accordance with law.


(b)
 The district courts of the United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant or carries on business are hereby vested with jurisdiction to review such ruling, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within twenty days from the date of the entry of such ruling. Service of process in such proceedings may be had on the Secretary by delivering a copy of the complaint to the Secretary. If the court determines that such ruling is not in accordance with law, it shall remand such proceedings to the Secretary with directions either (1) to make such ruling as the court shall determine to be in accordance with law, or (2) to take such further proceedings as, in its opinion, the law requires.


 Enforcement

(b)
 Civil penalties
Any person who willfully violates any provision of any order issued by the Secretary under this subchapter shall be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not more than $1,000 for each such violation and, in the case of a willful failure to pay, collect, or remit the assessment as required by the order, in addition to the amount due, a penalty equal to the amount of the assessment on the quantity of milk as to which the failure applies. The amount of any such penalty shall accrue to the United States and may be recovered in a civil suit brought by the United States.




(c)
 Availability of other remedies
The remedies provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, other remedies that may be available.




 Investigations; power to subpena and take oaths and affirmations; aid of courts
The Secretary may make such investigations as the Secretary deems necessary for the effective administration of this subchapter or to determine whether any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter has engaged or is about to engage in any act that constitutes or will constitute a violation of any provision of this subchapter or of any order, or rule or regulation issued under this subchapter. For the purpose of such investigation, the Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any records that are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena to, any person, the Secretary may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of records. The court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Secretary to produce records or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation.

Process in any such case may be served in the judicial district in which such person is an inhabitant or wherever such person may be found.
