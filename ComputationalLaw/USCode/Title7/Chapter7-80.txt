Chapter 80
WATERMELON RESEARCH AND PROMOTION
 Congressional findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 Congress finds that—
(1)
 the per capita consumption of watermelons in the United States has declined steadily in recent years;




(2)
 watermelons are an important cash crop to many farmers in the United States and are an economical, enjoyable, and healthful food for consumers;




(3)
 approximately 2,607,600,000 pounds of watermelons with a farm value of $158,923,000 were produced in 1981 in the United States;




(4)
 watermelons move in the channels of interstate commerce, and watermelons that do not move in such channels directly affect interstate commerce;




(5)
 the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the establishment of new or improved markets and uses for watermelons are vital to the welfare of watermelon growers and those concerned with marketing, using, handling, and importing watermelons, as well as the general economic welfare of the Nation; and




(6)
 the development and implementation of coordinated programs of research, development, advertising, and promotion are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets and establish new or improved markets and uses for watermelons.




(b)
 It is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is essential in the public interest, through the exercise of the powers provided herein, to authorize the establishment of an orderly procedure for the development, financing (through adequate assessments on watermelons harvested in the United States, or imported into the United States, for commercial use), and carrying out of an effective, continuous, and coordinated program of research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon’s competitive position in the marketplace, and establish, maintain, and expand domestic and foreign markets for watermelons. The purpose of this chapter is to so authorize the establishment of such procedure and the development, financing, and carrying out of such program. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to dictate quality standards nor provide for the control of production or otherwise limit the right of individual watermelon producers to produce watermelons.


 Definitions
 Issuance of plans
To effectuate the declared policy of this chapter, the Secretary shall, under the provisions of this chapter, issue, and from time to time may amend, orders (applicable to producers, handlers, and importers of watermelons) authorizing the collection of assessments on watermelons under this chapter and the use of such funds to cover the costs of research, development, advertising, and promotion with respect to watermelons under this chapter. Any plan shall be applicable to watermelons produced in the United States or imported into the United States.
 Notice and hearings
(a)
 When sufficient evidence, as determined by the Secretary, is presented to the Secretary by watermelon producers, handlers, and importers, or whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that a plan will tend to effectuate the declared policy of this chapter, the Secretary shall give due notice and opportunity for a hearing on a proposed plan. Such hearing may be requested by watermelon producers, handlers, or importers or by any other interested person, including the Secretary, when the request for such hearing is accompanied by a proposal for a plan.


(b)
 After notice and opportunity for hearing as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall issue a plan if the Secretary finds, and sets forth in such plan, on the evidence introduced at the hearing that the issuance of the plan and all the terms and conditions thereof will tend to effectuate the declared policy of this chapter.

 of this title.


 Enforcement
(a)
 The several district courts of the United States are vested with jurisdiction specifically to enforce, and to prevent and restrain any person from violating, any plan or regulation made or issued under this chapter. The facts relating to any civil action that may be brought under this subsection shall be referred to the Attorney General for appropriate action, except that nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the Secretary to refer to the Attorney General violations of this chapter whenever the Secretary believes that the administration and enforcement of the plan or regulation would be adequately served by administrative action under subsection (b) of this section or suitable written notice or warning to any person committing the violations.


(b)
(1)
 Any person who violates any provision of any plan or regulation issued by the Secretary under this chapter, or who fails or refuses to pay, collect, or remit any assessment or fee required of the person thereunder, may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not less than $500 nor more than $5,000 for each violation. Each violation shall be a separate offense. In addition to or in lieu of such civil penalty, the Secretary may issue an order requiring the person to cease and desist from continuing the violation. No penalty shall be assessed nor cease and desist order issued unless the person is given notice and opportunity for a hearing before the Secretary with respect to the violation. The order of the Secretary assessing a penalty or imposing a cease and desist order shall be final and conclusive unless the person affected by the order files an appeal from the Secretary’s order with the appropriate United States court of appeals.




(2)
 Any person against whom a violation is found and a civil penalty assessed or cease and desist order issued under paragraph (1) may obtain review in the court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which such person resides or carries on business or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by filing a notice of appeal in such court within thirty days after the date of the order and by simultaneously sending a copy of the notice by certified mail to the Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record on which the violation was found. The findings of the Secretary shall be set aside only if found to be unsupported by substantial evidence.




(3)
 Any person who fails to obey a cease and desist order after it has become final and unappealable, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered a final judgment in favor of the Secretary, shall be subject to a civil penalty assessed by the Secretary, after opportunity for a hearing and for judicial review under the procedures specified in paragraphs (1) and (2), of not more than $500 for each offense. Each day during which the failure continues shall be deemed a separate offense.




(4)
 If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General for recovery of the amount assessed in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.




 Investigation and power to subpoena
(a)
 The Secretary may make such investigations as the Secretary deems necessary to carry out effectively the Secretary’s responsibilities under this chapter or to determine whether a person has engaged or is engaging in any acts or practices that constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, or of any plan or regulation issued under this chapter. For the purpose of an investigation, the Secretary may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents that are relevant to the inquiry. The attendance of witnesses and the production of records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any person, including a handler (or an importer who is subject to the plan), the Secretary may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring the person to appear before the Secretary, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district in which the person is an inhabitant or wherever the person may be found. The site of any hearing held under this subsection shall be within the judicial district in which the person is an inhabitant or in which the person’s principal place of business is located.


(b)
 No person shall be excused from attending and testifying or from producing books, papers, and documents before the Secretary, or in obedience to the subpoena of the Secretary, or in any cause or proceeding, criminal or otherwise, based on, or growing out of, any alleged violation of this chapter, or of any plan or regulation issued thereunder, on the grounds that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture. However, no person shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which the person is compelled, after having claimed the person’s privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, except that any individual so testifying shall not be exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.

The ballots and other information or reports that reveal or tend to reveal the vote of any producer, handler, or importer or the person’s volume of watermelons produced, handled, or imported shall be held strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed. Any officer or employee of the Department of Agriculture violating the provisions hereof shall be subject to the penalties provided in 
section 4908(c) of this title
