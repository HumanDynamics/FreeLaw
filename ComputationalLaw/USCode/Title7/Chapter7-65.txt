Chapter 65
WHEAT AND WHEAT FOODS RESEARCH AND NUTRITION EDUCATION
 Congressional findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 Wheat is basic to the American diet and the American economy. It is grown by thousands of farmers and consumed, in various forms, by millions of people in the United States.


(b)
 The size of the American wheat crop and how it is marketed and ultimately consumed determines whether many Americans receive adequate nourishment. Wheat has a strong impact on the Nation’s well-being. Additional research on the optimal use of wheat products can improve the American diet. Consumer education about the nutritional value and economic use of wheat products can enhance the national welfare.


(c)
 It has long been recognized that it is in the national interest to have a regular, adequate, and high quality wheat supply. It would be extremely difficult, without an effective coordinated research and nutrition education effort, to accomplish this objective. A programed effort of research and nutrition education is of great importance to wheat producers, processors, end product manufacturers, and consumers.


(d)
 It is the purpose of this chapter and in the public interest to authorize and enable the creation of an orderly procedure, adequately financed through an assessment, for the development and initiation of an effective and continuous coordinated program of research and nutrition education, designed to improve and enhance the quality, and make the most efficient use, of American wheat, processed wheat, and wheat end products to ensure an adequate diet for the people of the United States. The maximum rate of assessment authorized hereunder represents an infinitesimal proportion of the overall cost of manufacturing wheat end products. Therefore, such assessment will not significantly affect the retail prices of those products. Furthermore, any price effect will be more than offset by the increased efficiency in end product manufacture and increased consumer acceptance, due to nutritional improvements in wheat products, which may be expected to follow from adoption of a plan under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to provide for control of production or otherwise limit the right of individual wheat producers to produce wheat.

Qualified end product manufacturers may register with the Secretary by mail to vote in such referendum during a period ending not less than thirty days prior to the date of the referendum. Within ten days thereafter, the Secretary shall determine which end product manufacturers are eligible to vote in such referendum and cause to be published the list of such eligible voters. The Secretary shall issue ballots to all such persons who have so registered and been declared eligible to vote. No order issued pursuant to this chapter shall be effective unless the Secretary determines (1) that votes were cast by at least 50 per centum of such registered end product manufacturers, and (2) that the issuance of such order is approved or favored by not less than two-thirds of the end product manufacturers voting in such referendum or by a majority of the end product manufacturers voting in such referendum if such majority manufactured end products containing not less than two-thirds of the total processed wheat contained in all end products manufactured by those voting in the referendum, during the representative period defined by the Secretary: 
 Refund of processed wheat assessment
(a)
 Election of end product manufacturers to seek refunds
Subsequent to the approval by the Secretary of the annual budget of the Council or amendments thereto, a summary of such budget or amendments thereto, including a brief general description of the proposed research and nutrition education programs contemplated therein, shall be published in the Federal Register. All end product manufacturers not exempt hereunder shall have sixty days from the date of such publication within which to elect, under such conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, by so indicating to the Council in writing, by registered or certified mail, to reserve the right to seek refunds under subsection (b) of this section. Only those end product manufacturers who make such an election, under the described procedure, shall be eligible for refunds of assessments paid during the one-year period immediately following the expiration of such sixty-day period.




(b)
 Refund demand; rules and regulations
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any end product manufacturer who has been subject to and has paid an assessment, but who has reserved the right, under subsection (a) of this section, to seek a refund, and who is not in favor of supporting the programs as provided for herein, shall have the right to demand and receive from the Council a refund of such assessment: 
Provided
, That such demand shall be made by such end product manufacturer in accordance with regulations, and on a form and within a time period, prescribed by the Council and approved by the Secretary and upon submission of proof satisfactory to the Council that the end product manufacturer paid the assessment for which refund is sought, and any such refund shall be made within sixty days after demand is received therefor.

After such hearing, the Secretary shall make a ruling upon the prayer of such petition which shall be final, if in accordance with law.




(b)
 Judicial review; jurisdiction; process; remand
The district courts of the United States in any district in which such person is an inhabitant, or has his principal place of business, are hereby vested with jurisdiction to review such ruling, provided a complaint for that purpose is filed within twenty days from the date of the entry of such ruling.

(b)
 Referendum
The Secretary may conduct a referendum at any time, and shall hold a referendum on request of 10 per centum or more of the number of end product manufacturers subject to the order, to determine whether such manufacturers favor the termination or suspension of the order, and the Secretary shall suspend or terminate such order within six months after the Secretary determines that suspension or termination of the order is approved or favored by a majority of the end product manufacturers voting in such referendum who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the manufacture of end products or by end product manufacturers who produced end products containing more than 50 per centum of the total processed wheat contained in all end products manufactured during such period by the end product manufacturers voting in the referendum.
