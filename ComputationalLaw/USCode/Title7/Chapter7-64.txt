March 2, 1887
 (
7 U.S.C. 361a
 et seq.), commonly known as the Hatch Act of 1887;




(B)
 the Act of 
October 10, 1962
 (
16 U.S.C. 582a
 et seq.), commonly known as the McIntire-Stennis Act of 1962;




(C)
 subchapter V of this chapter; and




(D)
 subchapter VI of this chapter;






(2)
 extension programs under subchapter VI of this chapter and the Act of 
May 8, 1914
 (
7 U.S.C. 341
 et seq.), commonly known as the Smith-Lever Act;




(3)
 teaching programs under—

 Congressional statement of purpose
It is the purpose of this subchapter to promote the general welfare through improved productivity of the Nation’s rangelands, which comprise 60 per centum of the land area of the United States. Most of these rangelands are unsuited for cultivation, but produce a great volume of forage that is inedible by humans but readily converted, through an energy efficient process, to high quality food protein by grazing animals. These native grazing lands are located throughout the United States and are important resources for major segments of the Nation’s livestock industry. In addition to the many livestock producers directly dependent on rangelands, other segments of agriculture are indirectly dependent on range-fed livestock and on range-produced forage that can be substituted for grain in times of grain scarcity. Recent resource assessments indicate that forage production of rangeland can be increased at least 100 per centum through development and application of improved range management practices while simultaneously enhancing wildlife, watershed, recreational, and aesthetic values and reducing hazards of erosion and flooding.
 Program; development, purposes, scope, etc.
The Secretary may develop and implement a cooperative rangeland research program in coordination with the program carried out under the Renewable Resources Extension Act of 1978 [
