Chapter 91
LIME PROMOTION, RESEARCH, AND CONSUMER INFORMATION
 Findings, purposes, and limitations
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
 domestically produced limes are grown by many individual producers;




(2)
 virtually all domestically produced limes are grown in the States of Florida and California;




(3)
 limes move in interstate and foreign commerce, and limes that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce in limes;




(4)
 in recent years, large quantities of limes have been imported into the United States;




(5)
 the maintenance and expansion of existing domestic and foreign markets for limes and the development of additional and improved markets for limes are vital to the welfare of lime producers and other persons concerned with producing, marketing, or processing limes;




(6)
 a coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer information regarding limes is necessary for the maintenance and development of such markets; and




(7)
 lime producers, lime producer-handlers, lime handlers, and lime importers are unable to implement and finance such a program without cooperative action.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are—
(1)
 to authorize the establishment of an orderly procedure for the development and financing (through an adequate assessment) of an effective and coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer information regarding limes designed—
(A)
 to strengthen the position of the lime industry in domestic and foreign markets, and




(B)
 to maintain, develop, and expand markets for limes; and






(2)
 to treat domestically produced and imported limes equitably.




(c)
 Limitations
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require quality standards for limes, control the production of limes, or otherwise limit the right of the individual producers to produce limes.




“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress finds the following:
“(1)
 The Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act of 1990 [
7 U.S.C. 6201
 et seq.] was enacted on 
November 28, 1990
, for the purpose of establishing an orderly procedure for the development and financing of an effective and coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer information to strengthen the domestic and foreign markets for limes.




“(2)
 The lime research, promotion, and consumer information order required by such Act became effective on 
January 27, 1992
.




“(3)
 Although the intent of such Act was to cover seedless limes, the definition of the term ‘lime’ in section 1953(6) of such Act [
7 U.S.C. 6202(6)
] applies to seeded limes. Therefore, the Act and the order need to be revised before a research, promotion, and consumer information program on seedless limes can go into effect.




“(4)
 Since the enactment of the Lime Research, Promotion, and Consumer Information Act of 1990, the United States production of fresh market limes has plummeted and the volume of imports has risen dramatically. The drop in United States production is primarily due to damage to lime orchards in the State of Florida by Hurricane Andrew in August 1992. United States production is not expected to reach pre-Hurricane Andrew levels for possibly two to three years because a majority of the United States production of limes is in Florida.




“(b)
 
Purposes
.—
The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note above] is—
“(1)
 to revise the definition of the term ‘lime’ in order to cover seedless and not seeded limes;




“(2)
 to increase the exemption level;




“(3)
 to delay the initial referendum date; and




“(4)
 to alter the composition of the Lime Board.”
