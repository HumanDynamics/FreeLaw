Chapter 89
PECAN PROMOTION AND RESEARCH
 Findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
 pecans are a native American nut that is an important food, and is a valuable part of the human diet;




(2)
 the production of pecans plays a significant role in the economy of the United States in that pecans are produced by thousands of pecan producers, shelled and processed by numerous shellers and processors, and pecans produced in the United States are consumed by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign countries;




(3)
 pecans must be high quality, readily available, handled properly, and marketed efficiently to ensure that consumers have an adequate supply of pecans;




(4)
 the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and development of new markets for pecans are vital to the welfare of pecan producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and producing pecans, as well as to the general economy of the United States, and necessary to ensure the ready availability and efficient marketing of pecans;




(5)
 there exist established State organizations conducting pecan promotion, research, and industry and consumer education programs that are invaluable to the efforts of promoting the consumption of pecans;




(6)
 the cooperative development, financing, and implementation of a coordinated national program of pecan promotion, research, industry information, and consumer information are necessary to maintain and expand existing markets and develop new markets for pecans; and




(7)
 pecans move in interstate and foreign commerce, and pecans that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce in pecans.




(b)
 Policy
It is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided in this chapter, of an orderly procedure for developing, financing (through adequate assessments on pecans produced or imported into the United States), and carrying out an effective, continuous, coordinated program of promotion, research, industry information, and consumer information designed to—
(1)
 strengthen the pecan industry’s position in the marketplace;




(2)
 maintain and expand existing domestic and foreign markets and uses for pecans; and




(3)
 develop new markets and uses for pecans.
