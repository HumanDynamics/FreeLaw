 To attain the goal of installing solar energy systems in 20,000 Federal buildings by 2010, as contained in the Federal Government’s Million Solar Roof Initiative of 1997.




(D)
 To stimulate the general use within the Federal Government of life-cycle costing and innovative procurement methods.




(E)
 To develop program performance data to support policy decisions on future incentive programs with respect to energy.






(3)
 Acquisition of photovoltaic solar electric systems.—
(A)
 
In general
.—
The program shall provide for the acquisition of photovoltaic solar electric systems and associated storage capability for use in public buildings.




(B)
 
Acquisition levels
.—
The acquisition of photovoltaic electric systems shall be at a level substantial enough to allow use of low-cost production techniques with at least 150 megawatts (peak) cumulative acquired during the 5 years of the program.






(4)
 
Administration
.—
The Administrator shall administer the program and shall—
(A)
 issue such rules and regulations as may be appropriate to monitor and assess the performance and operation of photovoltaic solar electric systems installed pursuant to this subsection;
