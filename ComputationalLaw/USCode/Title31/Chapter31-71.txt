Chapter 71
JOINT FUNDING SIMPLIFICATION
 Purposes
 Definitions
 Authority of the President and heads of executive agencies
(a)
 The President shall prescribe necessary regulations to carry out 
section 7101 of this title
 and to ensure that this chapter is applied by all executive agencies consistently. The regulations may require executive agencies to adopt or prescribe procedures requiring applicants for assistance for a project to be jointly financed under this chapter to take steps to—
(1)
 get the views and recommendations of States and local governments that may be significantly affected by the project; and




(2)
 resolve questions of common interest to those States and local governments before making application.




(b)
 Subject to regulations prescribed under subsection (a) of this section and other law, the head of an executive agency may do the following by an order of the agency head or by agreement with another executive agency:
(1)
 identify related programs likely to be particularly suitable in providing joint financing for specific kinds of projects.




(2)
 to assist in planning and developing a project financed from different programs, develop and prescribe—
(A)
 guidelines;




(B)
 model or illustrative projects;




(C)
 joint or common application forms; and




(D)
 other materials or guidance.






(3)
 review administrative program requirements to identify requirements that may impede joint financing of a project and modify the requirements when appropriate.




(4)
 establish common technical or administrative regulations for related programs to assist in providing joint financing to support a specific project or class of projects.




(5)
 establish joint or common application processing and project supervision procedures, including procedures for designating—
(A)
 a lead agency responsible for processing applications; and




(B)
 a managing agency responsible for project supervision.






(c)
 The head of an executive agency shall—
(1)
 take maximum action to carry out 
section 7101 of this title
 in conducting an assistance program of the agency; and




(2)
 consult and cooperate with the heads of other executive agencies to carry out 
section 7101 of this title
 in conducting assistance programs of different executive agencies that may be used jointly to finance projects undertaken by States, local governments, or private nonprofit organizations.




 Processing project requests to be financed by at least 2 assistance programs
 Prescribing uniform technical and administrative provisions
(a)
 To make participation in a project easier than would be possible because of varying or conflicting technical or administrative regulations and procedures not required by law, the head of an executive agency may prescribe uniform provisions about inconsistent or conflicting requirements on—
(1)
 financial administration of the project (including accounting, reporting and auditing, and maintaining a separate bank account), to the extent consistent with 
section 7108 of this title
;




(2)
 the timing of payments by the United States Government for the project when one schedule or a combined schedule is to be established for the project;




(3)
 providing assistance by grant rather than procurement contract or by procurement contract rather than by grant; and




(4)
 accountability for, or the disposition of, records, property, or structures acquired or constructed with assistance from the Government when common regulations are established for the project.




(b)
 To make easier the processing of applications for assistance, the head of an executive agency may provide for review of proposals for a project by one panel, board, or committee where reviews by separate panels, boards, or committees are not specifically required by law.


(c)
 Notwithstanding a requirement that one public agency or a specific public agency be established or designated to carry out or supervise that part of the assistance from the Government under an assistance program for a jointly financed project, the head of the executive agency carrying out the program may waive the requirement when—
(1)
 administration by another public agency is consistent with State or local law and the objectives of the assistance program; and




(2)
(A)
 the waiver is requested by the head of a unit of general government certifying jurisdiction over the public agencies concerned; or




(B)
 the State or local public agencies concerned agree to the waiver.






 Delegation of supervision of assistance
 Joint management funds
(a)
 In supporting a project, a joint management fund may be established to administer more effectively amounts received from more than one assistance program or appropriation. A proportional share of the amount required to pay a grantee shall be transferred periodically to the fund from each program or appropriation. When a project is completed, the grantee shall return to the fund an amount not expended.


(b)
 An account in a joint management fund is subject to an agreement made by the heads of the executive agencies providing assistance for the project about the responsibilities of each agency. An agreement shall—
(1)
 ensure the availability of necessary information to the executive agencies and Congress;




(2)
 provide that the agency administering a fund is responsible and accountable by program and appropriation for the amounts provided for the purposes of each account in the fund; and




(3)
 include procedures for returning, subject to fiscal year limitations, an excess amount to participating executive agencies under the applicable appropriation. An excess amount of an expired appropriation lapses from the fund.




(c)
 For each project financed through an account in a joint management fund, a recipient of an amount from the fund shall keep records prescribed by the head of the executive agency responsible for administering the fund. The records shall include—
(1)
 the amount and disposition by the recipient of assistance received under each program and appropriation;




(2)
 the total cost of the project for which assistance was given or used;




(3)
 that part of the cost of the project provided from other sources; and




(4)
 other records that will make it easier to carry out an audit.




(d)
 Records of a recipient related to an amount received from a joint management fund shall be made available to the head of the executive agency responsible for administering the fund and the Comptroller General for inspection and audit.


(e)
 For a project subject to a joint management fund, one non-Government share may be established conforming to—
(1)
 the proportional shares applicable to the assistance programs involved; and




(2)
 the proportional shares of an amount transferred to the project account from each of the programs.




 Limitation on authority under sections 7105–7107
 Appropriations available for joint financing
An appropriation available for technical assistance or personnel training under an assistance program is available for technical assistance and training for a project proposed or approved for joint financing involving the program and another assistance program.
 Use of joint financing provisions for Federal-State assisted projects
Under regulations prescribed by the President, the head of an executive agency may make an agreement with a State to extend the benefits of this chapter to a project involving assistance from at least one executive agency and at least one State agency. The agreement may include arrangements to process requests or administer assistance on a joint basis.
