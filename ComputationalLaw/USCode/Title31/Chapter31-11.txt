 Federal managers are seriously disadvantaged in their efforts to improve program efficiency and effectiveness, because of insufficient articulation of program goals and inadequate information on program performance; and

 congressional policymaking, spending decisions and program oversight are seriously handicapped by insufficient attention to program performance and results.




“(b)
 
Purposes

“(1)
 improve the confidence of the American people in the capability of the Federal Government, by systematically holding Federal agencies accountable for achieving program results;




“(2)
 initiate program performance reform with a series of pilot projects in setting program goals, measuring program performance against those goals, and reporting publicly on their progress;




“(3)
 improve Federal program effectiveness and public accountability by promoting a new focus on results, service quality, and customer satisfaction;

 help Federal managers improve service delivery, by requiring that they plan for meeting program objectives and by providing them with information about program results and service quality;

 improve congressional decisionmaking by providing more objective information on achieving statutory objectives, and on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of Federal programs and spending; and
