(d)
 On October 1 of each year after the date of enactment of the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall adjust each dollar amount specified in subsections (b) and (c) to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor, for the 12 months ending the preceding June 30.


 Additional payments
(a)
 In addition to payments the Secretary of the Interior makes under 
section 6902 of this title
, the Secretary shall make a payment for each fiscal year to a unit of general local government collecting and distributing real property taxes (including a unit in Alaska outside the boundaries of an organized borough) in which is located an interest in land that—
(1)
 the United States Government acquires for—
(A)
 the National Park System; or




(B)
 the National Forest Wilderness Areas; and






(2)
 was subject to local real property taxes within the 5-year period before the interest is acquired.




(b)
 The Secretary shall make payments only for the 5 fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the interest in land is acquired. Under guidelines the Secretary prescribes, the unit of general local government receiving the payment from the Secretary shall distribute payments proportionally to units and school districts that lost real property taxes because of the acquisition of the interest. A unit receiving a distribution may use a payment for any governmental purpose.


(c)
 Each yearly payment by the Secretary under this section is equal to one percent of the fair market value of the interest in land on the date the Government acquires the interest. However, a payment may not be more than the amount of real property taxes levied on the property during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest is acquired. A decision on fair market value under this section may not include an increase in the value of an interest because the land is rezoned when the rezoning causes the increase after the date of enactment of a law authorizing the acquisition of an interest under subsection (a) of this section.


(d)
 The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments may be made to units of general local government when subsections (a) and (b) of this section will not carry out the purpose of subsections (a) and (b).


 Redwood National Park and the Lake Tahoe Basin
(a)
 The Secretary of the Interior shall make a payment for each fiscal year to each unit of general local government in which an interest in land owned by the United States Government in the Redwood National Park is located. A unit may use the payment for any governmental purpose. The payment shall be made as provided in 
section 6903 of this title
 and shall include an amount payable under section 6903.


(b)
(1)
 In addition to payments the Secretary makes under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall make a payment for each fiscal year to each unit of general local government in which is located an interest in land—
(A)
 owned by the Government in the Redwood National Park; or




(B)
 acquired in the Lake Tahoe Basin under the Act of 
December 23, 1980
 (
Public Law 96–586
, 
94 Stat. 3383
).






(2)
 The payment shall be made as provided in 
section 6904 of this title
 and shall include an amount payable under section 6904. However, an amount computed but not paid because of the first sentence of subsection (b) and the 2d sentence of subsection (c) of section 6904 shall be carried forward and applied to future years in which the payment would not otherwise equal the amount of real property taxes assessed and levied on the land during the last fiscal year before the fiscal year in which the interest was acquired until the amount is applied completely.




(3)
 The unit of general local government may use the payment for any governmental purpose.




(4)
 The Redwoods Community College District is a school district under 
section 6904(b) of this title
.




 Funding
 State legislation requiring reallocation or redistribution of payments to smaller units of general purpose government
(a)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a State may enact legislation which requires that any payments which would be made to units of general local government pursuant to this chapter be reallocated and redistributed in whole or part to other smaller units of general purpose government which (1) are located within the boundaries of the larger unit of general local government, (2) provide general governmental services and (3) contain entitlement lands within their boundaries. Such reallocation or redistribution shall generally reflect the level of services provided by, and the number of entitlement acres within, the smaller unit of general local government.


(b)
 Upon enactment of legislation by a State, described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall make one payment to such State equaling the aggregate amount of payments which he otherwise would have made to units of general local government within such State pursuant to this chapter. It shall be the responsibility of such State to make any further distribution of the payment pursuant to subsection (a). Such redistribution shall be made within 30 days after receipt of such payment. No payment, or portion thereof, made by the Secretary shall be used by any State for the administration of this subsection or subsection (a).


(c)
 Appropriations made for payments in lieu of taxes for a fiscal year may be used to correct underpayments in the previous fiscal year to achieve equity among all qualified recipients.
