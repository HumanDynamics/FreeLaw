 Except as provided in this subchapter, an appropriation available for obligation for a definite period shall be apportioned to prevent obligation or expenditure at a rate that would indicate a necessity for a deficiency or supplemental appropriation for the period.

section 1512 of this title
 shall apportion the appropriation in writing. An appropriation shall be apportioned not later than the later of the following:

 30 days after the date of enactment of the law by which the appropriation is made available.

The system shall be designed to—
(1)
 restrict obligations or expenditures from each appropriation to the amount of apportionments or reapportionments of the appropriation; and

(1)
 Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, an official may make, and the head of an executive agency may request, an apportionment under

(A)
 a law enacted after submission to Congress of the estimates for an appropriation that requires an expenditure beyond administrative control; or




(B)
 an emergency involving the safety of human life, the protection of property, or the immediate welfare of individuals when an appropriation that would allow the United States Government to pay, or contribute to, amounts required to be paid to individuals in specific amounts fixed by law or under formulas prescribed by law, is insufficient.

(1)
 credited to an applicable existing or new appropriation account;




(2)
 merged with the amount in an account to which the balance is credited; and
