Chapter 39
PROMPT PAYMENT
 Definitions and application
(a)
 In this chapter—
(1)
 “agency” has the same meaning given that term in 
section 551(1) of title 5
 and includes an entity being operated, and the head of the agency identifies the entity as being operated, only as an instrumentality of the agency to carry out a program of the agency.




(2)
 “business concern” means—
(A)
 a person carrying on a trade or business; and




(B)
 a nonprofit entity operating as a contractor.






(3)
 “proper invoice” is an invoice containing or accompanied by substantiating documentation the Director of the Office of Management and Budget may require by regulation and the head of the appropriate agency may require by regulation or contract.




(4)
 for the purposes of determining a payment due date and the date upon which any late payment interest penalty shall begin to accrue, the head of the agency is deemed to receive an invoice—
(A)
 on the later of—
(i)
 the date on which the place or person designated by the agency to first receive such invoice actually receives a proper invoice; or




(ii)
 on the 7th day after the date on which, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, the property is actually delivered or performance of the services is actually completed, as the case may be, unless—
(I)
 the agency has actually accepted such property or services before such 7th day; or




(II)
 the contract (except in the case of a contract for the procurement of a brand-name commercial item for authorized resale) specifies a longer acceptance period, as determined by the contracting officer to be required to afford the agency a practicable opportunity to inspect and test the property furnished or evaluate the services performed; or








(B)
 on the date of the invoice, if the agency has failed to annotate the invoice with the date of receipt at the time of actual receipt by the place or person designated by the agency to first receive such invoice.






(5)
 a payment is deemed to be made on the date a check for payment is dated or an electronic fund transfer is made.




(6)
 a contract to rent property is deemed to be a contract to acquire the property.




(b)
 This chapter applies to the Tennessee Valley Authority. However, regulations prescribed under this chapter do not apply to the Authority, and the Authority alone is responsible for carrying out this chapter as it applies to contracts of the Authority.


(c)
 This chapter applies to the United States Postal Service. However, the Postmaster General shall be responsible for issuing the implementing procurement regulations, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses for the United States Postal Service.


(d)
(1)
 Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, this chapter, except 
section 3907 of this title
, applies to the District of Columbia Courts.




(2)
 A claim for an interest penalty not paid under this chapter may be filed in the same manner as claims are filed with respect to contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts.




(3)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B), an interest penalty under this chapter does not continue to accrue for more than one year or after a claim for an interest penalty is filed in the manner described in paragraph (2), whichever is earlier.




(B)
 If a claim for an interest penalty is filed in the manner described in paragraph (2) and interest is not available for such claims under the laws and regulations governing claims under contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts, interest will accrue under this chapter as provided in paragraph (A) and from the date the claim is filed until the date the claim is paid.






(4)
 Paragraph (3) of this subsection does not prevent an interest penalty from accruing on a claim if such interest is available for such claim under the laws and regulations governing claims under contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts. Such interest may accrue on an unpaid contract payment and on the unpaid penalty under this chapter.




(5)
 Except as provided in 
section 3904 of this title
, this chapter does not require an interest penalty on a payment that is not made because of a dispute between the head of an agency and a business concern over the amount of payment or compliance with the contract. A claim related to the dispute, and any interest payable for the period during which the dispute is being resolved, is subject to the laws and regulations governing claims under contracts to provide property or services for the District of Columbia Courts.




 Interest penalties
(a)
 Under regulations prescribed under 
section 3903 of this title
, the head of an agency acquiring property or service from a business concern, who does not pay the concern for each complete delivered item of property or service by the required payment date, shall pay an interest penalty to the concern on the amount of the payment due. The interest shall be computed at the rate of interest established by the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the Federal Register, for interest payments under section 7109(a)(1) and (b) of title 41, which is in effect at the time the agency accrues the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty.


(b)
 The interest penalty shall be paid for the period beginning on the day after the required payment date and ending on the date on which payment is made.


(c)
(1)
 A business concern shall be entitled to an interest penalty of $1.00 or more which is owed such business concern under this section, and such penalty shall be paid without regard to whether the business concern has requested payment of such penalty.




(2)
 Each payment subject to this chapter for which a late payment interest penalty is required to be paid shall be accompanied by a notice stating the amount of the interest penalty included in such payment and the rate by which, and period for which, such penalty was computed.




(3)
 If a business concern—
(A)
 is owed an interest penalty by an agency;




(B)
 is not paid the interest penalty in a payment made to the business concern by the agency on or after the date on which the interest penalty becomes due;




(C)
 is not paid the interest penalty by the agency within 10 days after the date on which such payment is made; and




(D)
 makes a written demand, not later than 40 days after the date on which such payment is made, that the agency pay such a penalty,





such business concern shall be entitled to an amount equal to the sum of the late payment interest penalty to which the contractor is entitled and an additional penalty equal to a percentage of such late payment interest penalty specified by regulation by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, subject to such maximum as may be specified in such regulations.




(d)
 The temporary unavailability of funds to make a timely payment due for property or services does not relieve the head of an agency from the obligation to pay interest penalties under this section.


(e)
 An amount of an interest penalty unpaid after any 30-day period shall be added to the principal amount of the debt, and a penalty accrues thereafter on the added amount.


(f)
 This section does not authorize the appropriation of additional amounts to pay an interest penalty. The head of an agency shall pay a penalty under this section out of amounts made available to carry out the program for which the penalty is incurred.


(g)
 A recipient of a grant from the head of an agency may provide in a contract for the acquisition of property or service from a business concern that, consistent with the usual business practices of the recipient and applicable State and local law, the recipient will pay an interest penalty on amounts overdue under the contract under conditions agreed to by the recipient and the concern. The recipient may not pay the penalty from amounts received from an agency. Amounts expended for the penalty may not be counted toward a matching requirement applicable to the grant. An obligation to pay the penalty is not an obligation of the United States Government.


(h)
(1)
 This section shall apply to contracts for the procurement of property or services entered into pursuant to 
section 4(h) of the Act of June 29, 1948
 (
15 U.S.C. 714b(h)
).




(2)
(A)
 In the case of a payment to which producers on a farm are entitled under the terms of an agreement entered into under the Agricultural Act of 1949 (
7 U.S.C. 1421
 et seq.), an interest penalty shall be paid to the producers if the payment has not been made by the required payment or loan closing date. The interest penalty shall be paid—
(i)
 on the amount of payment or loan due; and




(ii)
 for the period beginning on the first day beginning after the required payment or loan closing date and ending on the date the amount is paid or loaned.






(B)
 As used in this subsection, the “required payment or loan closing date” means—
(i)
 for a purchase agreement, the 30th day after delivery of the warehouse receipt for the commodity subject to the purchase agreement;




(ii)
 for a loan agreement, the 30th day beginning after the date of receipt of an application with all requisite documentation and signatures, unless the applicant requests that the disbursement be deferred;




(iii)
 for refund of amounts received greater than the amount required to repay a commodity loan, the first business day after the Commodity Credit Corporation receives payment for such loan;




(iv)

(v)
 for an advance land diversion payment, 30 days after the date the Commodity Credit Corporation executes the contract with the producer;




(vi)
 for a deficiency payment (other than advance payments) based upon a 12-month or 5-month period, 91 days after the end of such period; or




(vii)
 for an advance deficiency payment, 30 days after the date the Commodity Credit Corporation executes the contract with the producer.








(3)
 Payment of the interest penalty under this subsection shall be made out of funds available under 
section 8 of the Act of June 29, 1948
 (
15 U.S.C. 714f
).




(4)
 
Section 3907 of this title

 Payment provisions relating to construction contracts
(a)
 In the event that a contractor, after making a certified payment request to an agency pursuant to 
section 3903(b) of this title
, discovers that a portion or all of such payment request constitutes a payment for performance by such contractor that fails to conform to the specifications, terms, and conditions of its contract (hereafter in this subsection referred to as the “unearned amount”), then the contractor shall—
(1)
 notify the agency of such performance deficiency; and




(2)
 be obligated to pay the Government an amount equal to interest on the unearned amount (computed in the manner provided in 
section 3903(c) of this title
), from the date of the contractor’s receipt of such unearned amount until—
(A)
 the date the contractor notifies the agency that the performance deficiency has been corrected; or




(B)
 the date the contractor reduces the amount of any subsequent certified application for payment to such agency by an amount equal to the unearned amount.






(b)
 Each construction contract awarded by an agency shall include a clause that requires the prime contractor to include in each subcontract for property or services entered into by the prime contractor and a subcontractor (including a material supplier) for the purpose of performing such construction contract—

 a payment clause which obligates the prime contractor to pay the subcontractor for satisfactory performance under its subcontract within 7 days out of such amounts as are paid to the prime contractor by the agency under such contract; and

(B)
 computed at the rate specified by 
section 3902(a) of this title

 The construction contract awarded by the agency shall further require the prime contractor to include in each of its subcontracts (for the purpose of performance of such construction contract) a provision requiring the subcontractor to include a payment clause and an interest penalty clause conforming to the standards of subsection (b) of this section in each of its subcontracts and to require each of its subcontractors to include such clauses in their subcontracts with each lower-tier subcontractor or supplier.


(d)
 The clauses required by subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not be construed to impair the right of a prime contractor or a subcontractor at any tier to negotiate, and to include in their subcontract, provisions which—
(1)
 permit the prime contractor or a subcontractor to retain (without cause) a specified percentage of each progress payment otherwise due to a subcontractor for satisfactory performance under the subcontract, without incurring any obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed to by the parties to the subcontract, giving such recognition as the parties deem appropriate to the ability of a subcontractor to furnish a performance bond and a payment bond;




(2)
 permit the contractor or subcontractor to make a determination that part or all of the subcontractor’s request for payment may be withheld in accordance with the subcontract agreement; and

 a notice conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this section has been previously furnished to the subcontractor; and




(B)
 a copy of any notice issued by a prime contractor pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph has been furnished to the Government.






(e)

(1)
 furnish to the subcontractor a notice conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this section as soon as practicable upon ascertaining the cause giving rise to a withholding, but prior to the due date for subcontractor payment;




(2)
 furnish to the Government, as soon as practicable, a copy of the notice furnished to the subcontractor pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection;

(B)
 incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty computed at the rate specified by

 the dates that such withholding began and ended; and








(6)
 be obligated to pay to the Government an amount equal to interest on the withheld payments (computed in the manner provided in 
section 3903(c) of this title

(A)
 the day the identified subcontractor performance deficiency is corrected; or




(B)
 the date that any subsequent payment is reduced under paragraph (5)(A).






(f)
(1)
 If a prime contractor, after making payment to a first-tier subcontractor, receives from a supplier or subcontractor of the first-tier subcontractor (hereafter referred to as a “second-tier subcontractor”) a written notice in accordance with 
section 3133(b) of title 40
, asserting a deficiency in such first-tier subcontractor’s performance under the contract for which the prime contractor may be ultimately liable, and the prime contractor determines that all or a portion of future payments otherwise due such first-tier subcontractor is subject to withholding in accordance with the subcontract agreement, then the prime contractor may, without incurring an obligation to pay an interest penalty under subsection (e)(6) of this section—
(A)
 furnish to the first-tier subcontractor a notice conforming to the standards of subsection (g) of this section as soon as practicable upon making such determination; and




(B)
 withhold from the first-tier subcontractor’s next available progress payment or payments an amount not to exceed the amount specified in the notice of withholding furnished under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.






(2)
 As soon as practicable, but not later than 7 days after receipt of satisfactory written notification that the identified subcontract performance deficiency has been corrected, the prime contractor shall pay the amount withheld under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection to such first-tier subcontractor, or shall incur an obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty to such first-tier subcontractor computed at the rate specified by

(i)
 A dispute between a contractor and subcontractor relating to the amount or entitlement of a subcontractor to a payment or a late payment interest penalty under a clause included in the subcontract pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section does not constitute a dispute to which the United States is a party.
