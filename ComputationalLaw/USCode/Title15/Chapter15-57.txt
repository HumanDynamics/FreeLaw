Chapter 57
INTERSTATE HORSERACING
 Congressional findings and policy
(a)
 The Congress finds that—
(1)
 the States should have the primary responsibility for determining what forms of gambling may legally take place within their borders;




(2)
 the Federal Government should prevent interference by one State with the gambling policies of another, and should act to protect identifiable national interests; and




(3)
 in the limited area of interstate off-track wagering on horseraces, there is a need for Federal action to ensure States will continue to cooperate with one another in the acceptance of legal interstate wagers.




(b)
 It is the policy of the Congress in this chapter to regulate interstate commerce with respect to wagering on horseracing, in order to further the horseracing and legal off-track betting industries in the United States.


“(a)
 The provisions of this Act [this chapter] shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act [
Oct. 25, 1978
], and, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall apply to any interstate off-track wager accepted on or after such date of enactment.


“(b)
(1)
 The provisions of this Act [this chapter] shall not apply to any interstate off-track wager which is accepted pursuant to a contract existing on 
May 1, 1978
.




“(2)
 The provisions of this Act shall not apply to any form of legal non-parimutuel off-track betting existing in a State on 
May 1, 1978
.




“(3)
 The provisions of subsection (b) of section 5 of this Act [
section 3004(b) of this title
] shall not apply to any parimutuel off-track betting system existing on 
May 1, 1978
, in a State which does not conduct parimutuel horseracing on the date of enactment of this Act [
Oct. 25, 1978
].”




 Definitions
 Acceptance of interstate off-track wager
No person may accept an interstate off-track wager except as provided in this chapter.
 Regulation of interstate off-track wagering
(a)
 Consent of host racing association, host racing commission, and off-track racing commission as prerequisite to acceptance of wager
An interstate off-track wager may be accepted by an off-track betting system only if consent is obtained from—
(1)
 the host racing association, except that—
(A)
 as a condition precedent to such consent, said racing association (except a not-for-profit racing association in a State where the distribution of off-track betting revenues in that State is set forth by law) must have a written agreement with the horsemen’s group, under which said racing association may give such consent, setting forth the terms and conditions relating thereto; provided,




(B)
 that where the host racing association has a contract with a horsemen’s group at the time of enactment of this chapter which contains no provisions referring to interstate off-track betting, the terms and conditions of said then-existing contract shall be deemed to apply to the interstate off-track wagers and no additional written agreement need be entered into unless the parties to such then-existing contract agree otherwise. Where such provisions exist in such existing contract, such contract shall govern. Where written consents exist at the time of enactment of this chapter between an off-track betting system and the host racing association providing for interstate off-track wagers, or such written consents are executed by these parties prior to the expiration of such then-existing contract, upon the expiration of such then-existing contract the written agreement of such horsemen’s group shall thereafter be required as such condition precedent and as a part of the regular contractual process, and may not be withdrawn or varied except in the regular contractual process. Where no such written consent exists, and where such written agreement occurs at a racing association which has a regular contractual process with such horsemen’s group, said agreement by the horsemen’s group may not be withdrawn or varied except in the regular contractual process;






(2)
 the host racing commission;




(3)
 the off-track racing commission.




(b)
 Approval of tracks as prerequisite to acceptance of wager; exceptions
(1)
 In addition to the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any off-track betting office shall obtain the approval of—
(A)
 all currently operating tracks within 60 miles of such off-track betting office; and




(B)
 if there are no currently operating tracks within 60 miles then the closest currently operating track in an adjoining State.






(2)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, any off-track betting office in a State with at least 250 days of on-track parimutuel horseracing a year, may accept interstate off-track wagers for a total of 60 racing days and 25 special events a year without the approval required by paragraph (1), if with respect to such 60 racing days, there is no racing of the same type at the same time of day being conducted within the off-track betting State within 60 miles of the off-track betting office accepting the wager, or such racing program cannot be completed. Excluded from such 60 days and from the consent required by subsection (b)(1) of this section may be dark days which occur during a regularly scheduled race meeting in said off-track betting State. In order to accept any interstate off-track wager under the terms of the preceding sentence the off-track betting office shall make identical offers to any racing association described in subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(1) of this section. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed to reduce or eliminate the necessity of obtaining all the approvals required by subsection (a) of this section.




(c)
 Takeout amount
No parimutuel off-track betting system may employ a takeout for an interstate wager which is greater than the takeout for corresponding wagering pools of off-track wagers on races run within the off-track State except where such greater takeout is authorized by State law in the off-track State.




 Liability and damages
 Civil action
(a)
 Parties; remedies
The host State, the host racing association, or the horsemen’s group may commence a civil action against any person alleged to be in violation of this chapter, for injunctive relief to restrain violations and for damages in accordance with 
section 3005 of this title
.




(b)
 Intervention
In any civil action under this section, the host State, the host racing association and horsemen’s group, if not a party, shall be permitted to intervene as a matter of right.




(c)
 Limitations
A civil action may not be commenced pursuant to this section more than 3 years after the discovery of the alleged violation upon which such civil action is based.




(d)
 State as defendant
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit a State to be sued under this section other than in accordance with its applicable laws.




 Jurisdiction and venue
(a)
 District court jurisdiction
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over any civil action under this chapter, without regard to the citizenship of the parties or the amount in controversy.




(b)
 Venue; service of process
A civil action under this chapter may be brought in any district court of the United States for a district located in the host State or the off-track State, and all process in any such civil action may be served in any judicial district of the United States.




(c)
 Concurrent State court jurisdiction
The jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States pursuant to this section shall be concurrent with that of any State court of competent jurisdiction located in the host State or the off-track State.
