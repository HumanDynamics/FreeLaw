(b)
 Proposal criteria
Each proposal shall—

 demonstrate the support of the metal casting industry by describing—
(A)
 how industry has participated in deciding what research activities will be undertaken;




(B)
 how industry will participate in the evaluation of the applicant’s progress in research and development activities; and




(C)
 the extent to which industry funds are committed to the applicant’s proposal;






(2)
 have a commitment for matching funds from non-Federal sources, which shall consist of:
(A)
 cash, or




(B)
 as determined by the Secretary, the fair market value of equipment, services, materials, appropriate technology transfer activities, and other assets directly related to the proposal’s cost;






(3)
 include a single or multiyear management plan that outlines how the research and development activities will be administered and carried out;




(4)
 state the annual cost of the proposal and a breakdown of those costs; and




(5)
 describe the technology transfer mechanisms the applicant will use to make available research results to industry and to other researchers.




(c)
 Content of management plan
The management plan set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section shall—
(1)
 outline the basic research and development activities expected to be performed;




(2)
 outline who will conduct those research activities;

 identifying managerial, organizational and administrative procedures and responsibilities;




(B)
 outlining how the coordination of research and development between the individuals and organizations involved will be achieved;




(C)
 demonstrating how implementation and monitoring of the progress of research projects after receipt of funding from the Secretary will be achieved;




(D)
 demonstrating how recommendations and implementations on modifications to the plan will be achieved; and




(E)
 providing sufficient rationale to support the plan’s costs.






(d)
 Selection of proposals
From the proposals submitted, the Secretary shall select proposals for funding. The Secretary shall attempt to select at least four proposals. The Secretary shall select the proposals that—
(1)
 will best result in carrying out needed metal casting research and development in one or more of the following general areas—
(A)
 solidification and casting technologies;




(B)
 computational modeling and design;




(C)
 processing technologies and design for energy efficiency, material conservation, environmental protection, or industrial productivity; and




(D)
 other areas of research, which in the judgment of the Secretary, after consulting with the Board established in 
section 5306 of this title
, further the purposes of this chapter;






(2)
 represent research and development in specific areas identified in the “Metal Casting Research Priorities” developed annually by the Board pursuant to 
section 5306(b)(1) of this title
;




(3)
 to the greatest extent possible and subject to available appropriations, ensure that at least one applicant is selected from each of the four census regions of the country where the metal casting industry is concentrated;




(4)
 demonstrate strong industry support;




(5)
 ensure the timely transfer of technology to industry; and




(6)
 otherwise best carry out the purposes of this chapter.




(e)
 Funding of program
From amounts made available in separate appropriation Acts, the Secretary shall provide to each applicant selected the financial and technical assistance and other incentives that are necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.




(f)
 National Metal Casting Research Institute
Each recipient of financial assistance under subsection (d) of this section shall be known as a “National Metal Casting Research Institute”.




 Review
(a)
 Evaluation of research activities
The Secretary shall regularly monitor and evaluate the research activities of the applicants selected. After considering the reports of the Board provided for in 
section 5306(b)(2) of this title

(c)
 Discontinuation of funding
In the event a selected applicant has substantially failed in the implementation of the management plan and research activities, the Secretary shall discontinue funding.




(d)
 Solicitation of new proposals
Upon completion or discontinuance of any research activity authorized in 
section 5304 of this title
, the Secretary shall, using available funds appropriated pursuant to this chapter, solicit new research proposals as set forth under the terms of this chapter.




 Industrial Advisory Board
(a)
 Establishment of Board
Within 120 days after 
October 15, 1990
, the Secretary, after consulting with representatives of trade and technical associations of the metal casting industry, shall establish an Industrial Advisory Board (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the “Board”) to provide guidance and oversight in implementing the selection criteria and operation of the program. The Board shall be composed of nine members who are selected by the Secretary, a majority of whom shall be individuals from the metal casting industry or individuals affiliated with the industry. At least one member of the Board shall be chosen from each of the four census regions of the country.

section 5304(d) of this title
 and submit to the Secretary a list of Metal Casting Research Priorities. Such list shall, to the greatest extent possible, identify specific areas of research that would be considered of a priority nature to the United States metal casting industry.




(2)
 On an annual basis the Board shall—
(A)
 review the Secretary’s solicitation and selection of research proposals and make recommendations as to how each such activity can be altered so as to better achieve the purposes of this chapter; and
