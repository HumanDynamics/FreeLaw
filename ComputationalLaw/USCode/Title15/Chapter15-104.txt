(1)
 directly or indirectly recruit or solicit a student athlete to enter into an agency contract, by—
(A)
 giving any false or misleading information or making a false promise or representation; or




(B)
 providing anything of value to a student athlete or anyone associated with the student athlete before the student athlete enters into an agency contract, including any consideration in the form of a loan, or acting in the capacity of a guarantor or co-guarantor for any debt;

 Required disclosure by athlete agents to student athletes
(1)
 In general
In conjunction with the entering into of an agency contract, an athlete agent shall provide to the student athlete, or, if the student athlete is under the age of 18, to such student athlete’s parent or legal guardian, a disclosure document that meets the requirements of this subsection. Such disclosure document is separate from and in addition to any disclosure which may be required under State law.






(2)
 Signature of student athlete
The disclosure document must be signed by the student athlete, or, if the student athlete is under the age of 18, by such student athlete’s parent or legal guardian, prior to entering into the agency contract.

 Required language
The disclosure document must contain, in close proximity to the signature of the student athlete, or, if the student athlete is under the age of 18, the signature of such student athlete’s parent or legal guardian, a conspicuous notice in boldface type stating: “Warning to Student Athlete: If you agree orally or in writing to be represented by an agent now or in the future you may lose your eligibility to compete as a student athlete in your sport. Within 72 hours after entering into this contract or before the next athletic event in which you are eligible to participate, whichever occurs first, both you and the agent by whom you are agreeing to be represented must notify the athletic director of the educational institution at which you are enrolled, or other individual responsible for athletic programs at such educational institution, that you have entered into an agency contract.”

).




(b)

 shall be construed to prevent an attorney general of a State from exercising the powers conferred on the attorney general by the laws of that State to—

 administer oaths or affirmations; or




(3)
 compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of documentary and other evidence.

 Civil remedy
(1)
 In general
An educational institution has a right of action against an athlete agent for damages caused by a violation of this chapter.

 Damages
Damages of an educational institution may include and are limited to actual losses and expenses incurred because, as a result of the conduct of the athlete agent, the educational institution was injured by a violation of this chapter or was penalized, disqualified, or suspended from participation in athletics by a national association for the promotion and regulation of athletics, by an athletic conference, or by reasonable self-imposed disciplinary action taken to mitigate actions likely to be imposed by such an association or conference.

 Sense of Congress
It is the sense of Congress that States should enact the Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, to protect student athletes and the integrity of amateur sports from unscrupulous sports agents. In particular, it is the sense of Congress that States should enact the provisions relating to the registration of sports agents, the required form of contract, the right of the student athlete to cancel an agency contract, the disclosure requirements relating to record maintenance, reporting, renewal, notice, warning, and security, and the provisions for reciprocity among the States.
