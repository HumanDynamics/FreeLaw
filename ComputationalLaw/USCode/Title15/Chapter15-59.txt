Chapter 59
RETAIL POLICIES FOR NATURAL GAS UTILITIES
 Purposes; coverage
(a)
 Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are to encourage—
(1)
 conservation of energy supplied by gas utilities;




(2)
 the optimization of the efficiency of use of facilities and resources by gas utility systems; and




(3)
 equitable rates to gas consumers of natural gas.




(b)
 Volume of total retail sales
This chapter applies to each gas utility in any calendar year, and to each proceeding relating to each gas utility in such year, if the total sales of natural gas by such utility for purposes other than resale exceeded 10 billion cubic feet during any calendar year beginning after 
December 31, 1975
, and before the immediately preceding calendar year.




(c)
 Exclusion of wholesale sales
The requirements of this chapter do not apply to the operations of a gas utility, or to proceedings respecting such operations, to the extent that such operations or proceedings relate to sales of natural gas for purposes of resale.




(d)
 List of covered utilities
Before the beginning of each calendar year, the Secretary shall publish a list identifying each gas utility to which this chapter applies during such calendar year. Promptly after publication of such list, each State regulatory authority shall notify the Secretary of each gas utility on the list for which such State regulatory authority has ratemaking authority.




 Definitions
 Adoption of certain standards
(a)
 Adoption of standards
Not later than 2 years after 
November 9, 1978
 (or after 
October 24, 1992
, in the case of standards under paragraphs (3),

 So in original. The comma probably should not appear.
 and (4) of subsection (b) of this section), each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility shall provide public notice and conduct a hearing respecting the standards established by subsection (b) of this section, and, on the basis of such hearing, shall—
(1)
 adopt the standard established by subsection (b)(1) of this section, if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law, and




(2)
 adopt the standards established by paragraphs (2), (3)

 So in original. A comma probably should appear.
 (4), (5), and (6) of subsection (b) of this section, if, and to the extent, such authority or nonregulated utility determines that such adoption is appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter, is otherwise appropriate, and is consistent with otherwise applicable State law.





For purposes of any determination under paragraphs (1) and (2) and any review of such determination in any court under 
section 3207 of this title
, the purposes of this chapter supplement State law. Nothing in this subsection prohibits any State regulatory authority or non­regulated utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to implement any such standard, pursuant to its authority under otherwise applicable State law.


(b)
 Establishment
The following Federal standards are hereby established:
(1)
 Procedures for termination of natural gas service
No gas utility may terminate natural gas service to any gas consumer except pursuant to procedures described in 
section 3204(a) of this title
.






(2)
 Advertising
No gas utility may recover from any person other than the shareholders (or other owners) of such utility any direct or indirect expenditure by such utility for promotional or political advertising as defined in 
section 3204(b) of this title
.






(3)
 Integrated resource planning
Each gas utility shall employ, in order to provide adequate and reliable service to its gas customers at the lowest system cost. All plans or filings of a State regulated gas utility before a State regulatory authority to meet the requirements of this paragraph shall (A) be updated on a regular basis, (B) provide the opportunity for public participation and comment, (C) provide for methods of validating predicted performance, and (D) contain a requirement that the plan be implemented after approval of the State regulatory authority. Subsection (c) of this section shall not apply to this paragraph to the extent that it could be construed to require the State regulatory authority to extend the record of a State proceeding in submitting reports to the Federal Government.






(4)
 Investments in conservation and demand management
The rates charged by any State regulated gas utility shall be such that the utility’s prudent investments in, and expenditures for, energy conservation and load shifting programs and for other demand-side management measures which are consistent with the findings and purposes of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 are at least as profitable (taking into account the income lost due to reduced sales resulting from such programs) as prudent investments in, and expenditures for, the acquisition or construction of supplies and facilities. This objective requires that (A) regulators link the utility’s net revenues, at least in part, to the utility’s performance in implementing cost-effective programs promoted by this section; and (B) regulators ensure that, for purposes of recovering fixed costs, including its authorized return, the utility’s performance is not affected by reductions in its retail sales volumes.






(5)
 Energy efficiency
Each natural gas utility shall—
(A)
 integrate energy efficiency resources into the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility; and




(B)
 adopt policies that establish energy efficiency as a priority resource in the plans and planning processes of the natural gas utility.






(6)
 Rate design modifications to promote energy efficiency investments
(A)
 In general
The rates allowed to be charged by a natural gas utility shall align utility incentives with the deployment of cost-effective energy efficiency.






(B)
 Policy options
In complying with subparagraph (A), each State regulatory authority and each nonregulated utility shall consider—
(i)
 separating fixed-cost revenue recovery from the volume of transportation or sales service provided to the customer;




(ii)
 providing to utilities incentives for the successful management of energy efficiency programs, such as allowing utilities to retain a portion of the cost-reducing benefits accruing from the programs;




(iii)
 promoting the impact on adoption of energy efficiency as 1 of the goals of retail rate design, recognizing that energy efficiency must be balanced with other objectives; and




(iv)
 adopting rate designs that encourage energy efficiency for each customer class.





For purposes of applying the provisions of this chapter

 to this paragraph, any reference in this chapter 
3
 to 
November 9, 1978
, shall be treated as a reference to 
December 19, 2007
.






(c)
 Procedural requirements
Each State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) and each nonregulated gas utility, within the 2-year period specified in subsection (a) of this section, shall adopt, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, each of the standards established by subsection (b) of this section, or, with respect to any such standard which is not adopted, such authority or nonregulated gas utility shall state in writing that it has determined not to adopt such standard, together with the reasons for such determination. Such statement of reasons shall be available to the public.




(d)
 Small business impacts
If a State regulatory authority implements a standard established by subsection (b)(3) or (4) of this section, such authority shall—
(1)
 consider the impact that implementation of such standard would have on small businesses engaged in the design, sale, supply, installation, or servicing of energy conservation, energy efficiency, or other demand-side management measures, and




(2)
 implement such standard so as to assure that utility actions would not provide such utilities with unfair competitive advantages over such small businesses.




 Special rules for standards
(a)
 Procedures for termination of gas service
The procedures for termination of service referred to in 
section 3203(b)(1) of this title

(1)
 no gas service to a gas consumer may be terminated unless reasonable prior notice (including notice of rights and remedies) is given to such consumer and such consumer has a reasonable opportunity to dispute the reasons for such termination, and




(2)
 during any period when termination of service to a gas consumer would be especially dangerous to health, as determined by the State regulatory authority (with respect to each gas utility for which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated gas utility, and such consumer establishes that—
(A)
 he is unable to pay for such service in accordance with the requirements of the utility’s billing, or
