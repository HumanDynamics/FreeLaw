Congressional Findings

Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the United States steel industry has been severely harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of steel imports into the United States since 1998, caused by the world financial crisis;




“(2)
 this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than 10,000 steel worker jobs since 1998, and was the imminent cause of three bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;




“(3)
 the crisis also forced almost all United States steel companies into—
“(A)
 reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and




“(B)
 an inability to obtain credit for continued operations and reinvestment in facilities;






“(4)
 the crisis also has affected the willingness of private banks and investment institutions to make loans to the United States steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in facilities;




“(5)
 these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential health, education, and municipal services that these government entities provide to their citizens; and




“(6)
 a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate defense preparedness of the United States in order to have sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, and armaments necessary for the national defense.
