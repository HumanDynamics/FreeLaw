 Definitions
 Sale of fasteners
(a)
 General rule
It shall be unlawful for a manufacturer or distributor, in conjunction with the sale or offer for sale of fasteners from a single lot, to knowingly misrepresent or falsify—
(1)
 the record of conformance for the lot of fasteners;




(2)
 the identification, characteristics, properties, mechanical or performance marks, chemistry, or strength of the lot of fasteners; or




(3)
 the manufacturer’s insignia.




(b)
 Representations
A direct or indirect reference to a consensus standard to represent that a fastener conforms to particular requirements of the consensus standard shall not be construed as a representation that the fastener meets all the requirements of the consensus standard.




(c)
 Specifications
A direct or indirect contractual reference to a consensus standard for the purpose of identifying particular requirements of the consensus standard that serve as specifications shall not be construed to require that the fastener meet all the requirements of the consensus standard.




(d)
 Use of accredited laboratories
In the case of fasteners manufactured solely to a consensus standard or standards, end-of-line testing required by the consensus standard or standards, if any, for the purpose of verifying that a lot of fasteners conforms with the grade identification marking called for in the consensus standard or standards to which the lot of fasteners has been manufactured shall be conducted by an accredited laboratory.




 Repealed. 
 Manufacturers’ insignias
(a)
 General rule
Unless the specifications provide otherwise, fasteners that are required by the applicable consensus standard or standards to bear an insignia identifying their manufacturer shall not be offered for sale or sold in commerce unless—

 the fasteners bear such insignia; and




(2)
 the manufacturer has complied with the insignia recordation requirements established under subsection (b) of this section.
