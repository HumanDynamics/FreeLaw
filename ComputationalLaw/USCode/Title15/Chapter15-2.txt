Chapter 2
 
 
 (a)
 
Short Title
.—
This chapter may be cited as the ‘Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program Act’.


“(b)
 
Findings
.—
Congress finds that—
“(1)
 consumption of foreign oil in the United States is estimated to equal 56 percent of all oil consumed, and that percentage could reach 68 percent by 2010 if current prices prevail;




“(2)
 the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United States is at its lowest since 1944, when records of this tally began;




“(3)
 if prices do not increase soon, the United States could lose at least half its marginal wells, which in aggregate produce as much oil as the United States imports from Saudi Arabia;




“(4)
 oil and gas prices are unlikely to increase for at least several years;




“(5)
 declining production, well abandonment, and greatly reduced exploration and development are shrinking the domestic oil and gas industry;




“(6)
 the world’s richest oil producing regions in the Middle East are experiencing increasingly greater political instability;




“(7)
 United Nations policy may make Iraq the swing oil producing nation, thereby granting Saddam Hussein tremendous power;




“(8)
 reliance on foreign oil for more than 60 percent of our daily oil and gas consumption is a national security threat;




“(9)
 the level of United States oil security is directly related to the level of domestic production of oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas; and




“(10)
 a national security policy should be developed that ensures that adequate supplies of oil are available at all times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile acts.
