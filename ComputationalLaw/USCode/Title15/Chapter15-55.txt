section 2804(a) of this title
; or

 such determination—
(I)
 was made after the date such franchise was entered into or renewed, and




(II)
 was based upon the occurrence of changes in relevant facts and circumstances after such date;

(I)
 the franchisor, during the 180-day period after notification was given pursuant to

(i)
 such changes or additions are the result of determinations made by the franchisor in good faith and in the normal course of business; and

 there exist sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make such questions a fair ground for litigation; and

 the court determines that, on balance, the hardships imposed upon the franchisor by the issuance of such preliminary injunctive relief will be less than the hardship which would be imposed upon such franchisee if such preliminary injunctive relief were not granted.

(A)
 consistent with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to actual damages;




(B)
 in the case of any such action which is based upon conduct of the franchisor which was in willful disregard of the requirements of section 2802, 2803, or 2807 of this title, or the rights of the franchisee thereunder, to exemplary damages, where appropriate; and




(C)
 to reasonable attorney and expert witness fees to be paid by the franchisor, unless the court determines that only nominal damages are to be awarded to such franchisee, in which case the court, in its discretion, need not direct that such fees be paid by the franchisor.

 the requirements of 
section 2804 of this title
 have been complied with.
