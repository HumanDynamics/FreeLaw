Chapter 14A
AID TO SMALL BUSINESS
 Declaration of policy
(a)
 Aid, counsel, assistance, etc., to small business concerns
The essence of the American economic system of private enterprise is free competition. Only through full and free competition can free markets, free entry into business, and opportunities for the expression and growth of personal initiative and individual judgment be assured. The preservation and expansion of such competition is basic not only to the economic well-being but to the security of this Nation. Such security and well-being cannot be realized unless the actual and potential capacity of small business is encouraged and developed. It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid, counsel, assist, and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small-business concerns in order to preserve free competitive enterprise, to insure that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts or subcontracts for property and services for the Government (including but not limited to contracts or subcontracts for maintenance, repair, and construction) be placed with small-business enterprises, to insure that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to such enterprises, and to maintain and strengthen the overall economy of the Nation.




(b)
 Assistance to compete in international markets
(1)
 It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Federal Government, through the Administrator of the Small Business Administration, acting through the Associate Administrator for International Trade, and in cooperation with the Department of Commerce and other relevant State and Federal agencies, should aid and assist small businesses, as defined under this chapter, to increase their ability to compete in international markets by—
(A)
 enhancing their ability to export;




(B)
 facilitating technology transfers;




(C)
 enhancing their ability to compete effectively and efficiently against imports;




(D)
 increasing the access of small businesses to long-term capital for the purchase of new plant and equipment used in the production of goods and services involved in international trade;




(E)
 disseminating information concerning State, Federal, and private programs and initiatives to enhance the ability of small businesses to compete in international markets; and




(F)
 ensuring that the interests of small businesses are adequately represented in bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations.






(2)
 The Congress recognizes that the Department of Commerce is the principal Federal agency for trade development and export promotion and that the Department of Commerce and the Small Business Administration work together to advance joint interests. It is the purpose of this chapter to enhance, not alter, their respective roles.




(c)
 Aid for agriculturally related industries; financial assistance
It is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government, through the Small Business Administration, should aid and assist small business concerns which are engaged in the production of food and fiber, ranching, and raising of livestock, aquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related industries; and the financial assistance programs authorized by this chapter are also to be used to assist such concerns.




(d)
 Use of assistance programs to establish, preserve, and strengthen small business concerns
(1)
 The assistance programs authorized by sections 636(i) and 636(j) of this title are to be utilized to assist in the establishment, preservation, and strengthening of small business concerns and improve the managerial skills employed in such enterprises, with special attention to small business concerns (1) located in urban or rural areas with high proportions of unemployed or low-income individuals; or (2) owned by low-income individuals; and to mobilize for these objectives private as well as public managerial skills and resources.




(2)
(A)
 With respect to the programs authorized by 
section 636(j) of this title
, the Congress finds—
(i)
 that ownership and control of productive capital is concentrated in the economy of the United States and certain groups, therefore, own and control little productive capital;




(ii)
 that certain groups in the United States own and control little productive capital because they have limited opportunities for small business ownership;




(iii)
 that the broadening of small business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital is essential to provide for the well-being of this Nation by promoting their increased participation in the free enterprise system of the United States;




(iv)
 that such development of business ownership among groups that presently own and control little productive capital will be greatly facilitated through the creation of a small business ownership development program, which shall provide services, including, but not limited to, financial, management, and technical assistance.

 So in original. The period probably should be a semicolon.




(v)
 that the power to let Federal contracts pursuant to 
section 637(a) of this title
 can be an effective procurement assistance tool for development of business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital; and




(vi)
 that the procurement authority under 
section 637(a) of this title
 shall be used only as a tool for developing business ownership among groups that own and control little productive capital.






(B)
 It is therefore the purpose of the programs authorized by 
section 636(j) of this title
 to—
(i)
 foster business ownership and development by individuals in groups that own and control little productive capital; and




(ii)
 promote the competitive viability of such firms in the marketplace by creating a small business and capital ownership development program to provide such available financial, technical, and management assistance as may be necessary.








(e)
 Assistance to victims of floods, etc., and those displaced as result of federally aided construction programs
Further, it is the declared policy of the Congress that the Government should aid and assist victims of floods and other catastrophes, and small-business concerns which are displaced as a result of federally aided construction programs.




(f)
 Findings; purpose
(1)
 with

 So in original. Probably should be capitalized.
 respect to the Administration’s business development programs the Congress finds—
(A)
 that the opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by socially and economically disadvantaged persons is essential if we are to obtain social and economic equality for such persons and improve the functioning of our national economy;




(B)
 that many such persons are socially disadvantaged because of their identification as members of certain groups that have suffered the effects of discriminatory practices or similar invidious circumstances over which they have no control;




(C)
 that such groups include, but are not limited to, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Indian tribes, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Hawaiian Organizations, and other minorities;




(D)
 that it is in the national interest to expeditiously ameliorate the conditions of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;




(E)
 that such conditions can be improved by providing the maximum practicable opportunity for the development of small business concerns owned by members of socially and economically disadvantaged groups;




(F)
 that such development can be materially advanced through the procurement by the United States of articles, equipment, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from such concerns; and




(G)
 that such procurements also benefit the United States by encouraging the expansion of suppliers for such procurements, thereby encouraging competition among such suppliers and promoting economy in such procurements.






(2)
 It is therefore the purpose of 
section 637(a) of this title
 to—
(A)
 promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals so that such concerns can compete on an equal basis in the American economy;




(B)
 promote the competitive viability of such concerns in the marketplace by providing such available contract, financial, technical, and mangement

 assistance as may be necessary; and




(C)
 clarify and expand the program for the procurement by the United States of articles, supplies, services, materials, and construction work from small business concerns owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.






(g)
 Assistance to disaster victims under disaster loan program
In administering the disaster loan program authorized by 
section 636 of this title
, to the maximum extent possible, the Administration shall provide assistance and counseling to disaster victims in filing applications, providing information relevant to loan processing, and in loan closing and prompt disbursement of loan proceeds and shall give the disaster program a high priority in allocating funds for administrative expenses.




(h)
 Assistance to women owned business
(1)
 With respect to the programs and activities authorized by this chapter, the Congress finds that—
(A)
 women owned business has become a major contributor to the American economy by providing goods and services, revenues, and jobs;




(B)
 over the past two decades there have been substantial gains in the social and economic status of women as they have sought economic equality and independence;




(C)
 despite such progress, women, as a group, are subjected to discrimination in entrepreneurial endeavors due to their gender;




(D)
 such discrimination takes many overt and subtle forms adversely impacting the ability to raise or secure capital, to acquire managerial talents, and to capture market opportunities;




(E)
 it is in the national interest to expeditiously remove discriminatory barriers to the creation and development of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;




(F)
 the removal of such barriers is essential to provide a fair opportunity for full participation in the free enterprise system by women and to further increase the economic vitality of the Nation;




(G)
 increased numbers of small business concerns owned and controlled by women will directly benefit the United States Government by expanding the potential number of suppliers of goods and services to the Government; and




(H)
 programs and activities designed to assist small business concerns owned and controlled by women must be implemented in such a way as to remove such discriminatory barriers while not adversely affecting the rights of socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.






(2)
 It is, therefore, the purpose of those programs and activities conducted under the authority of this chapter that assist women entrepreneurs to—
(A)
 vigorously promote the legitimate interests of small business concerns owned and controlled by women;




(B)
 remove, insofar as possible, the discriminatory barriers that are encountered by women in accessing capital and other factors of production; and




(C)
 require that the Government engage in a systematic and sustained effort to identify, define and analyze those discriminatory barriers facing women and that such effort directly involve the participation of women business owners in the public/private sector partnership.






(i)
 Prohibition on use of funds for individuals not lawfully within United States
None of the funds made available pursuant to this chapter may be used to provide any direct benefit or assistance to any individual in the United States if the Administrator or the official to which the funds are made available receives notification that the individual is not lawfully within the United States.




(j)
 Contract bundling
In complying with the statement of congressional policy expressed in subsection (a) of this section, relating to fostering the participation of small business concerns in the contracting opportunities of the Government, each Federal agency, to the maximum extent practicable, shall—
(1)
 comply with congressional intent to foster the participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers;




(2)
 structure its contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns, taking all reasonable steps to eliminate obstacles to their participation; and




(3)
 avoid unnecessary and unjustified bundling of contract requirements that precludes small business participation in procurements as prime contractors.

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the Capital Ownership Development Program administered by the Small Business Administration and the award of contracts pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act [
15 U.S.C. 637(a)
] remain a primary tool for improving opportunities for small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals in the Federal procurement process and bringing such concerns into the nation’s economic mainstream;




“(2)
 although some progress has resulted from the Program, it has generally failed to meet its objectives, which remain as valid now as when the Program was initiated;




“(3)
 too few concerns that have exited the Program have been prepared to compete successfully in the open marketplace on competitive procurements, and many concerns have developed an unhealthy dependency on sole-source contracts by the time they are required to leave the Program;




“(4)
 the application and certification process for admitting new participants to the Program is inordinately lengthy and burdensome;




“(5)
 the Administration has often not efficiently and equitably administered and managed the Program in a manner that provided clear lines of responsibility for implementing and monitoring many of the administrative duties under the Program;




“(6)
 the Administration and some program participants have given insufficient attention and support to the business development goals of the Program and instead have focused almost entirely on the size of contract awards or the number of firms certified to participate in the Program;




“(7)
 many Federal procuring agencies have failed to identify and offer the necessary amount of contract support in order to allow for diversification and growth of disadvantaged businesses participating in the Program;




“(8)
 contract support as well as business development expenses have been misused both by the Administration and Program participants and have not been equitably distributed pursuant to objective criteria;




“(9)
 the widespread perception of undue political influence in the operation and administration of the Program has significantly contributed to the Program’s poor image and has deterred utilization of the Program by socially and economically disadvantaged concerns and by Federal procuring agencies; and




“(10)
 it is imperative that increased competition and other substantial reforms be accomplished in the Program in order to promote the Congressionally mandated business development objectives and purposes.




“(b)
 
Purposes
.—
The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under 
section 631 of this title
] therefore are to—
“(1)
 affirm that the Capital Ownership Development Program and the section 8(a) [
15 U.S.C. 637(a)
] authority shall be used exclusively for business development purposes to help small businesses owned and controlled by the socially and economically disadvantaged to compete on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy;




“(2)
 affirm that the measure of success of the Capital Ownership Development Program, and the section 8(a) authority, shall be the number of competitive firms that exit the Program without being unreasonably reliant on section 8(a) contracts and that are able to compete on an equal basis in the mainstream of the American economy;




“(3)
 ensure that program benefits accrue to individuals who are both socially and economically disadvantaged;




“(4)
 increase the number of small businesses owned and controlled by such individuals from which the United States may purchase products and services (including construction work); and




“(5)
 ensure integrity, competence, and efficiency in the administration of business development services and the Federal contracting opportunities made available to eligible small businesses.”




“(a)
 
Training Requirements for Business Opportunity Specialists
.—
(1)
 In each Small Business Administration field office responsible for assisting one or more Program Participants there shall be a position designated as a Business Opportunity Specialist. To the maximum extent practicable the Administration shall assure that an adequate number of Business Opportunity Specialists are assigned to each district office to carry out the responsibilities of sections 7(j) and 8(a) of the Small Business Act (
15 U.S.C. 636(j)
, 637(a)) and to assist Program Participants.




“(2)
 The Administration shall take such actions as may be appropriate to ensure that any person employed as a Business Opportunity Specialist receives adequate periodic training to assure such employee is capable of assisting Program Participants to fully utilize the Program and to meet the requirements of the Small Business Act [
15 U.S.C. 631
 et seq.], as amended by this Act.




“(b)
 
Pilot Program
.—
(1)
 Within 180 days after the effective date of this subsection [
Nov. 15, 1988
] the Administrator shall designate three regions of the Administration to conduct a pilot program pursuant to the provisions of this subsection. The designated regions shall contain approximately 30 per centum of the total number of Program Participants as of the time of designation.




“(2)
 A Business Opportunity Specialist employed in a Region designated pursuant to paragraph (1), in addition to other assigned duties and responsibilities, shall—
“(A)
 conduct contract negotiations on behalf of the Administration for contracts awarded pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (
15 U.S.C. 637(a)
) when performance will be rendered by one or more firms in such Specialist’s assigned portfolio;




“(B)
 facilitate and otherwise assist such firms in negotiating for the receipt of contracts to be let pursuant to such section.






“(3)
 The Administration shall take such actions as may be appropriate to train and qualify such Specialists to perform the negotiations required pursuant to paragraph (2).




“(4)
 To the extent practicable, the Administrator shall ensure that the performance appraisal system applicable to a Business Opportunity Specialist employed in a region designated pursuant to paragraph (1) affords substantial recognition to how well such Specialist’s assigned portfolio of concerns participating in the program established by section 7(j)(10) of the Small Business Act (
15 U.S.C. 636(j)(10)
) are achieving competitiveness and furthering the business development purposes of the program.




“(5)
 The Administration shall establish personnel positions for Business Opportunity Specialists employed in the regions designated pursuant to paragraph (1) that are classified at a grade level of the General Schedule that are sufficient, in the opinion of the Administrator, to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.




“(c)
 
Report and Pilot Program Termination
.—
(1)
 Within 120 days after the termination of the pilot program conducted pursuant to subsection (b), the Administration shall issue a report to the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and of the House of Representatives [Committee on Small Business of Senate now Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of Senate] on the effectiveness of the pilot. Such report shall contain such recommendations for administrative or legislative change as may be appropriate.




“(2)
 The pilot program conducted pursuant to subsection (b) shall be terminated three years after the date on which the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and of the House of Representatives [Committee on Small Business of Senate now Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship of Senate] receive written notification from the Administrator that the pilot is in full operation in each of the three designated pilot regions.”




 (a)
 The purposes of this title [enacting sections 632(c) and 636(a)(8) of this title and provisions set out as notes under sections 631 and 636 of this title] are—
“(1)
 to provide that a qualified employee trust shall be eligible for loan guarantees under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act [subsec. (a) of this section] with respect to a small business concern, regardless of the percentage of stock of the concern held by the trust, and




“(2)
 to provide in section 505 of this Act [enacting subsec. (a)(8) of this section] authority to address the specific case in which the Small Business Administration guarantees loans under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act [subsec. (a) of this section] for purposes of providing funds to a qualified employee trust (and other employee organizations which are treated as qualified employee trusts) for the purchase, by at least 51 percent of the employees, of at least 51 percent of the stock of business which is operated for profit and which is—
“(A)
 a small business concern, or




“(B)
 a corporation which is controlled by another person if, after the plan for the purchase of such corporation is carried out, such corporation would be a small business concern.






“(b)
 Nothing in this title shall be construed to prohibit the Small Business Administration from making loan guarantees under section 7(a) of the Small Business Act [subsec. (a) of this section] to qualified employee trusts which own less than 51 percent of the stock of a continuing business.”


“(a)
 Within sixty days after the enactment of this Act [
Aug. 21, 1958
], each Federal Reserve bank shall pay to the United States the aggregate amount which the Secretary of the Treasury has heretofore paid to such bank under the provisions of section 13b of the Federal Reserve Act [
12 U.S.C. 352a
]; and such payment shall constitute a full discharge of any obligation or liability of the Federal Reserve bank to the United States or to the Secretary of the Treasury arising out of subsection (e) of said section 13b [
12 U.S.C. 352a(e)
] or out of any agreement thereunder.

In any case in which the Administration certifies to any officer of the Government having procurement powers that the Administration is competent and responsible to perform any specific Government procurement contract to be let by any such officer, such officer shall be authorized in his discretion to let such procurement contract to the Administration upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon between the Administration and the procurement officer. Whenever the Administration and such procurement officer fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. Not later than 5 days from the date the Administration is notified of a procurement officer’s adverse decision, the Administration may notify the contracting officer of the intent to appeal such adverse decision, and within 15 days of such date the Administrator shall file a written request for a reconsideration of the adverse decision with the Secretary of the department or agency head. For the purposes of this subparagraph, a procurement officer’s adverse decision includes a decision not to make available for award pursuant to this subsection a particular procurement requirement or the failure to agree on the terms and conditions of a contract to be awarded noncompetitively under the authority of this subsection. Upon receipt of the notice of intent to appeal, the Secretary of the department or the agency head shall suspend further action regarding the procurement until a written decision on the Administrator’s request for reconsideration has been issued by such Secretary or agency head, unless such officer makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances which significantly affect interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a reconsideration of the adverse decision. If the Administrator’s request for reconsideration is denied, the Secretary of the department or agency head shall specify the reasons why the selected firm was determined to be incapable to perform the procurement requirement, and the findings supporting such determination, which shall be made a part of the contract file for the requirement. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price;




(B)
 to arrange for the performance of such procurement contracts by negotiating or otherwise letting subcontracts to socially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns for construction work, services, or the manufacture, supply, assembly of such articles, equipment, supplies, materials, or parts thereof, or servicing or processing in connection therewith, or such management services as may be necessary to enable the Administration to perform such contracts;




(C)
 to make an award to a small business concern owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals which has completed its period of Program Participation as prescribed by 
section 636(j)(15) of this title
, if—
(i)
 the contract will be awarded as a result of an offer (including price) submitted in response to a published solicitation relating to a competition conducted pursuant to subparagraph (D); and




(ii)
 the prospective contract awardee was a Program Participant eligible for award of the contract on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation; and






(D)
(i)
 A contract opportunity offered for award pursuant to this subsection shall be awarded on the basis of competition restricted to eligible Program Participants if—
(I)
 there is a reasonable expectation that at least two eligible Program Participants will submit offers and that award can be made at a fair market price, and




(II)
 the anticipated award price of the contract (including options) will exceed $5,000,000 in the case of a contract opportunity assigned a standard industrial classification code for manufacturing and $3,000,000 (including options) in the case of all other contract opportunities.






(ii)
 The Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development, on a nondelegable basis, is authorized to approve a request from an agency to award a contract opportunity under this subsection on the basis of a competition restricted to eligible Program Participants even if the anticipated award price is not expected to exceed the dollar amounts specified in clause (i)(II). Such approvals shall be granted only on a limited basis.








(2)
 Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (e) of 
section 3131 of title 40
, no small business concern shall be required to provide any amount of any bond as a condition of receiving any subcontract under this subsection if the Administrator determines that such amount is inappropriate for such concern in performing such contract: 
Provided
, That the Administrator shall exercise the authority granted by the paragraph only if—
(A)
 the Administration takes such measures as it deems appropriate for the protection of persons furnishing materials and labor to a small business receiving any benefit pursuant to this paragraph;




(B)
 the Administration assists, insofar as practicable, a small business receiving the benefits of this paragraph to develop, within a reasonable period of time, such financial and other capability as may be needed to obtain such bonds as the Administration may subsequently require for the successful completion of any program conducted under the authority of this subsection;




(C)
 the Administration finds that such small business is unable to obtain the requisite bond or bonds from a surety and that no surety is willing to issue bond or bonds subject to the guarantee provisions of Title IV of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 [
15 U.S.C. 692
 et seq.]; and




(D)
 the small business is determined to be a start-up concern and such concern has not been participating in any program conducted under the authority of this subsection for a period exceeding one year.





The authority to waive bonds provided in this paragraph (2) may not be exercised after 
September 30, 1988
.




(3)
(A)
 Any Program Participant selected by the Administration to perform a contract to be let noncompetitively pursuant to this subsection shall, when practicable, participate in any negotiation of the terms and conditions of such contract.




(B)
(i)
 For purposes of paragraph (1) a “fair market price” shall be determined by the agency offering the procurement requirement to the Administration, in accordance with clauses (ii) and (iii).




(ii)
 The estimate of a current fair market price for a new procurement requirement, or a requirement that does not have a satisfactory procurement history, shall be derived from a price or cost analysis. Such analysis may take into account prevailing market conditions, commercial prices for similar products or services, or data obtained from any other agency. Such analysis shall consider such cost or pricing data as may be timely submitted by the Administration.




(iii)
 The estimate of a current fair market price for a procurement requirement that has a satisfactory procurement history shall be based on recent award prices adjusted to insure comparability. Such adjustments shall take into account differences in quantities, performance times, plans, specifications, transportation costs, packaging and packing costs, labor and materials costs, overhead costs, and any other additional costs which may be deemed appropriate.






(C)
 An agency offering a procurement requirement for potential award pursuant to this subsection shall, upon the request of the Administration, promptly submit to the Administration a written statement detailing the method used by the agency to estimate the current fair market price for such contract, identifying the information, studies, analyses, and other data used by such agency. The agency’s estimate of the current fair market price (and any supporting data furnished to the Administration) shall not be disclosed to any potential offeror (other than the Administration).




(D)
 A small business concern selected by the Administration to perform or negotiate a contract to be let pursuant to this subsection may request the Administration to protest the agency’s estimate of the fair market price for such contract pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).

(6)
(A)
 Economically disadvantaged individuals are those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged. In determining the degree of diminished credit and capital opportunities the Administration shall consider, but not be limited to, the assets and net worth of such socially disadvantaged individual. In determining the economic disadvantage of an Indian tribe, the Administration shall consider, where available, information such as the following: the per capita income of members of the tribe excluding judgment awards, the percentage of the local Indian population below the poverty level, and the tribe’s access to capital markets.




(B)
 Each Program Participant shall annually submit to the Administration—
(i)
 a personal financial statement for each disadvantaged owner;




(ii)
 a record of all payments made by the Program Participant to each of its disadvantaged owners or to any person or entity affiliated with such owners; and




(iii)
 such other information as the Administration may deem necessary to make the determinations required by this paragraph.






(C)
(i)
 Whenever, on the basis of information provided by a Program Participant pursuant to subparagraph (B) or otherwise, the Administration has reason to believe that the standards to establish economic disadvantage pursuant to subparagraph (A) have not been met, the Administration shall conduct a review to determine whether such Program Participant and its disadvantaged owners continue to be impaired in their ability to compete in the free enterprise system due to diminished capital and credit opportunities when compared to other concerns in the same business area, which are not socially disadvantaged.




(ii)
 If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that a Program Participant and its disadvantaged owners are no longer economically disadvantaged for the purpose of receiving assistance under this subsection, the Program Participant shall be graduated pursuant to 
section 636(j)(10)(G) of this title
 subject to the right to a hearing as provided for under paragraph (9).






(D)
(i)
 Whenever, on the basis of information provided by a Program Participant pursuant to subparagraph (B) or otherwise, the Administration has reason to believe that the amount of funds or other assets withdrawn from a Program Participant for the personal benefit of its disadvantaged owners or any person or entity affiliated with such owners may have been unduly excessive, the Administration shall conduct a review to determine whether such withdrawal of funds or other assets was detrimental to the achievement of the targets, objectives, and goals contained in such Program Participant’s business plan.




(ii)
 If the Administration determines, pursuant to such review, that funds or other assets have been withdrawn to the detriment of the Program Participant’s business, the Administration shall—
(I)
 initiate a proceeding to terminate the Program Participant pursuant to 
section 636(j)(10)(F) of this title
, subject to the right to a hearing under paragraph (9); or




(II)
 require an appropriate reinvestment of funds or other assets and such other steps as the Administration may deem necessary to ensure the protection of the concern.








(E)

 the value of investments that disadvantaged owners have in their concerns, except that such value shall be taken into account under this paragraph when comparing such concerns to other concerns in the same business area that are owned by other than socially disadvantaged persons;




(ii)
 the equity that disadvantaged owners have in their primary personal residences, except that any portion of such equity that is attributable to unduly excessive withdrawals from a Program Participant or a concern applying for program participation shall be taken into account.








(7)
(A)
 No small business concern shall be deemed eligible for any assistance pursuant to this subsection unless the Administration determines that with contract, financial, technical, and management support the small business concern will be able to perform contracts which may be awarded to such concern under paragraph (1)(C) and has reasonable prospects for success in competing in the private sector.




(B)
 Limitations established by the Administration in its regulations and procedures restricting the award of contracts pursuant to this subsection to a limited number of standard industrial classification codes in an approved business plan shall not be applied in a manner that inhibits the logical business progression by a participating small business concern into areas of industrial endeavor where such concern has the potential for success.






(8)
 All determinations made pursuant to paragraph (5) with respect to whether a group has been subjected to prejudice or bias shall be made by the Administrator after consultation with the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development. All other determinations made pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5), (6), and (7) shall be made by the Associate Administrator for Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development under the supervision of, and responsible to, the Administrator.

 has been decided by or is the subject of an adjudication before a court of competent jurisdiction over such matters.

(10)
 The Administration shall develop and implement an outreach program to inform and recruit small business concerns to apply for eligibility for assistance under this subsection. Such program shall make a sustained and substantial effort to solicit applications for certification from small business concerns located in areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas and within States having relatively few Program Participants and from small disadvantaged business concerns in industry categories that have not substantially participated in the award of contracts let under the authority of this subsection.

 Contracting activities receiving capability statements shall, within 60 days after receipt, contact the relevant Business Opportunity Specialist to indicate the number, type, and approximate dollar value of contract opportunities that such activities may be awarding over the succeeding 12-month period and which may be appropriate to consider for award to those concerns for which it has received capability statements.

 Research and development
(a)
 Declaration of policy
Research and development are major factors in the growth and progress of industry and the national economy. The expense of carrying on research and development programs is beyond the means of many small-business concerns, and such concerns are handicapped in obtaining the benefits of research and development programs conducted at Government expense. These small-business concerns are thereby placed at a competitive disadvantage. This weakens the competitive free enterprise system and prevents the orderly development of the national economy. It is the policy of the Congress that assistance be given to small-business concerns to enable them to undertake and to obtain the benefits of research and development in order to maintain and strengthen the competitive free enterprise system and the national economy.

It shall be the duty of the Administration, and it is empowered—

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the small business innovation research program established under the Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982 [see Short Title of 1982 Amendment note set out under 
section 631 of this title
] (hereafter in this Act [see Short Title of 1992 Amendments note set out under 
section 631 of this title
] referred to as the ‘SBIR’ program) has been a successful method of involving small business concerns in Federal research and development;




“(2)
 the small business innovation research program has been an effective catalyst for the development of technological innovations by small business concerns;




“(3)
 small business innovation research program participants have provided high quality research and development in a cost-effective manner;




“(4)
 the innovative products and services developed by small business concerns participating in the small business innovation research program have been important to the national defense, as well as to the missions of the other participating Federal agencies;




“(5)
 the small business innovation research program has effectively stimulated the commercialization of technology developed through Federal research and development, benefiting both the public and private sectors of the Nation;




“(6)
 by encouraging the development and commercialization of technological innovations, the small business innovation research program has created jobs, expanded business opportunities for small firms, stimulated the development of new products and services, and improved the competitiveness of the Nation’s high technology industries;




“(7)
 the small business innovation research program has also helped to increase exports from small business concerns;




“(8)
 despite the general success of the small business innovation research program, the proportion of Federal research and development funds received by small business concerns has not increased over the life of the program, but has remained at 3 percent; and




“(9)

 The Committee on Small Business of either the Senate or the House of Representatives may request that the Office of the Inspector General of the Administration conduct an investigation of any program or activity conducted under the authority of section 636(j) or 637(a) of this title. Not later than thirty days after the receipt of such a request, the Inspector General shall inform the committee, in writing, of the disposition of the request by such office.




(f)
 Consultation and cooperation with Government departments and agencies
To the extent deemed necessary by the Administrator to protect and preserve small-business interests, the Administration shall consult and cooperate with other departments and agencies of the Federal Government in the formulation by the Administration of policies affecting small-business concerns. When requested by the Administrator, each department and agency of the Federal Government shall consult and cooperate with the Administration in the formulation by such department or agency of policies affecting small-business concerns, in order to insure that small-business interests will be recognized, protected, and preserved. This subsection shall not require any department or agency to consult or cooperate with the Administration in any case where the head of such department or agency determines that such consultation or cooperation would unduly delay action which must be taken by such department or agency to protect the national interest in an emergency.




(g)
 Annual report of employee conduct complaints received or acted upon and investigations undertaken by Administration
The Administration shall transmit, not later than December 31 of each year, to the Senate Select Committee on Small Business and Committee on Small Business of the House of Representatives a sealed report with respect to—
(1)
 complaints alleging illegal conduct by employees of the Administration which were received or acted upon by the Administration during the preceding fiscal year; and




(2)
 investigations undertaken by the Administration, including external and internal audits and security and investigation reports.




(h)
 Report to Congress on secondary market operations
The Administration shall transmit, not later than March 31 of each year, to the Committees on Small Business of the Senate and House of Representatives a report on the secondary market operations during the preceding calendar year. This report shall include, but not be limited to, (1) the number and the total dollar amount of loans sold into the secondary market and the distribution of such loans by size of loan, size of lender, geographic location of lender, interest rate, maturity, lender servicing fees, whether the rate is fixed or variable, and premium paid; (2) the number and dollar amount of loans resold in the secondary market with a distribution by size of loan, interest rate, and premiums; (3) the number and total dollar amount of pools formed; (4) the number and total dollar amount of loans in each pool; (5) the dollar amount, interest rate, and terms on each loan in each pool and whether the rate is fixed or variable; (6) the number, face value, interest rate, and terms of the trust certificates issued for each pool; (7) to the maximum extent possible, the use by the lender of the proceeds of sales of loans in the secondary market for additional lending to small business concerns; and (8) an analysis of the information reported in (1) through (7) to assess small businesses’ access to capital at reasonable rates and terms as a result of secondary market operations.




 Review of loan program; submission of estimated needs for additional authorization
It is the sense of the Congress that the regular business loan program of the Small Business Administration should be reviewed by the Congress at least once every two years. It is further the sense of the Congress that the Small Business Administration should submit its estimated needs for additional authorization for such program to the Congress at least one year in advance of the date on which such authorization is to be provided, in order to assure an orderly and recurring review of such program and to avoid emergency appeals for additional authorization. Compliance by the Small Business Administration with the foregoing policy will enable the Congress on and after 
 Voluntary agreements among small-business concerns
(a)
 Consultation with President
The President is authorized to consult with representatives of small-business concerns with a view to encouraging the making by such persons with the approval of the President of voluntary agreements and programs to further the objectives of this chapter.




(b)

No act or omission to act pursuant to this chapter which occurs while this chapter is in effect, if requested by the President pursuant to a voluntary agreement or program approved under subsection (a) of this section and found by the President to be in the public interest as contributing to the national defense, shall be construed to be within the prohibitions of the antitrust laws or the Federal Trade Commission Act [
15 U.S.C. 41
 et seq.] of the United States. A copy of each such request intended to be within the coverage of this section, and any modification or withdrawal thereof, shall be furnished to the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission when made, and it shall be published in the Federal Register unless publication thereof would, in the opinion of the President, endanger the national security.




(c)
 Delegation of authority; consultation; approval of requests
The authority granted in subsection (b) of this section shall be delegated only (1) to an official who shall for the purpose of such delegation be required to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, (2) upon the condition that such official consult with the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission not less than ten days before making any request or finding thereunder, and (3) upon the condition that such official obtain the approval of the Attorney General to any request thereunder before making the request.




(d)

 Transfer to Administration of other functions, powers, and duties
The President may transfer to the Administration any functions, powers, and duties of any department or agency which relate primarily to small-business problems. In connection with any such transfer, the President may provide for appropriate transfers of records, property, necessary personnel, and unexpended balances of appropriations and other funds available to the department or agency from which the transfer is made.
 Requirements for loans
No loan shall be made or equipment, facilities, or services furnished by the Administration under this chapter to any business enterprise unless the owners, partners, or officers of such business enterprise (1) certify to the Administration the names of any attorneys, agents, or other persons engaged by or on behalf of such business enterprise for the purpose of expediting applications made to the Administration for assistance of any sort, and the fees paid or to be paid to any such persons; (2) execute an agreement binding any such business enterprise for a period of two years after any assistance is rendered by the Administration to such business enterprise, to refrain from employing, tendering any office or employment to, or retaining for professional services, any person who, on the date such assistance or any part thereof was rendered, or within one year prior thereto, shall have served as an officer, attorney, agent, or employee of the Administration occupying a position or engaging in activities which the Administration shall have determined involve discretion with respect to the granting of assistance under this chapter; and (3) furnish the names of lending institutions to which such business enterprise has applied for loans together with dates, amounts, terms, and proof of refusal.
 Fair charge for use of Government-owned property
To the fullest extent the Administration deems practicable, it shall make a fair charge for the use of Government-owned property and make and let contracts on a basis that will result in a recovery of the direct costs incurred by the Administration.
 Awards or contracts
(a)
 Determination
To effectuate the purposes of this chapter, small-business concerns within the meaning of this chapter shall receive any award or contract or any part thereof, and be awarded any contract for the sale of Government property, as to which it is determined by the Administration and the contracting procurement or disposal agency (1) to be in the interest of maintaining or mobilizing the Nation’s full productive capacity, (2) to be in the interest of war or national defense programs, (3) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total purchases and contracts for property and services for the Government in each industry category are placed with small-business concerns, or (4) to be in the interest of assuring that a fair proportion of the total sales of Government property be made to small-business concerns; but nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to change any preferences or priorities established by law with respect to the sale of electrical power or other property by the Government or any agency thereof. These determinations may be made for individual awards or contracts or for classes of awards or contracts. If a proposed procurement includes in its statement of work goods or services currently being performed by a small business, and if the proposed procurement is in a quantity or estimated dollar value the magnitude of which renders small business prime contract participation unlikely, or if a proposed procurement for construction seeks to package or consolidate discrete construction projects, or the solicitation involves an unnecessary or unjustified bundling of contract requirements, as determined by the Administration, the Procurement Activity shall provide a copy of the proposed procurement to the Procurement Activity’s Small Business Procurement Center Representative at least 30 days prior to the solicitation’s issuance along with a statement explaining (1) why the proposed acquisition cannot be divided into reasonably small lots (not less than economic production runs) to permit offers on quantities less than the total requirement, (2) why delivery schedules cannot be established on a realistic basis that will encourage small business participation to the extent consistent with the actual requirements of the Government, (3) why the proposed acquisition cannot be offered so as to make small business participation likely, (4) why construction cannot be procured as separate discrete projects, or (5) why the agency has determined that the bundled contract (as defined in section 632(
o
) of this title) is necessary and justified. The thirty-day notification process shall occur concurrently with other processing steps required prior to issuance of the solicitation. Within 15 days after receipt of the proposed procurement and accompanying statement, if the Procurement Center Representative believes that the procurement as proposed will render small business prime contract participation unlikely, the Representative shall recommend to the Procurement Activity alternative procurement methods which would increase small business prime contracting opportunities. Whenever the Administration and the contracting procurement agency fail to agree, the matter shall be submitted for determination to the Secretary or the head of the appropriate department or agency by the Administrator. For purposes of clause (3) of the first sentence of this subsection, an industry category is a discrete group of similar goods and services. Such groups shall be determined by the Administration in accordance with the definition of a “United States industry” under the North American Industry Classification System, as established by the Office of Management and Budget, except that the Administration shall limit such an industry category to a greater extent than provided under such classification codes if the Administration receives evidence indicating that further segmentation for purposes of this paragraph is warranted due to special capital equipment needs or special labor or geographic requirements or to recognize a new industry. A market for goods or services may not be segmented under the preceding sentence due to geographic requirements unless the Government typically designates the area where work for contracts for such goods or services is to be performed and Government purchases comprise the major portion of the entire domestic market for such goods or services and, due to the fixed location of facilities, high mobilization costs, or similar economic factors, it is unreasonable to expect competition from business concerns located outside of the general areas where such concerns are located. A contract may not be awarded under this subsection if the award of the contract would result in a cost to the awarding agency which exceeds a fair market price.




(b)
 Placement of contracts by contracting procurement agency
With respect to any work to be performed the amount of which would exceed the maximum amount of any contract for which a surety may be guaranteed against loss under 
section 694b of this title
, the contracting procurement agency shall, to the extent practicable, place contracts so as to allow more than one small business concern to perform such work.




(c)
 Programs for blind and handicapped individuals
(1)
 As used in this subsection:
(A)
 The term “Committee” means the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled established under 
section 8502 of title 41
.




(B)
 The term “public or private organization for the handicapped” has the same meaning given such term in 
section 632(e) of this title
.




(C)
 The term “handicapped individual” has the same meaning given such term in 
section 632(f) of this title
.






(2)
(A)
 During fiscal year 1995, public or private organizations for the handicapped shall be eligible to participate in programs authorized under this section in an aggregate amount not to exceed $40,000,000.




(B)
 None of the amounts authorized for participation by subparagraph (A) may be placed on the procurement list maintained by the Committee pursuant to 
section 8503 of title 41
.






(3)
 The Administrator shall monitor and evaluate such participation.




(4)
(A)
 Not later than ten days after the announcement of a proposed award of a contract by an agency or department to a public or private organization for the handicapped, a for-profit small business concern that has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award may file an appeal of the proposed award with the Administrator.




(B)
 If such a concern files an appeal of a proposed award under subparagraph (A) and the Administrator, after consultation with the Executive Director of the Committee, finds that the concern has experienced or is likely to experience severe economic injury as the result of the proposed award, not later than thirty days after the filing of the appeal, the Administration shall require each agency and department having procurement powers to take such action as may be appropriate to alleviate economic injury sustained or likely to be sustained by the concern.






(5)
 Each agency and department having procurement powers shall report to the Office of Federal Procurement Policy each time a contract subject to paragraph (2)(A) is entered into, and shall include in its report the amount of the next higher bid submitted by a for-profit small business concern. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy shall collect data reported under the preceding sentence through the Federal procurement data system and shall report to the Administration which shall notify all such agencies and departments when the maximum amount of awards authorized under paragraph (2)(A) has been made during any fiscal year.




(6)
 For the purpose of this subsection, a contract may be awarded only if at least 75 per centum of the direct labor performed on each item being produced under the contract in the sheltered workshop or performed in providing each type of service under the contract by the sheltered workshop is performed by handicapped individuals.




(7)
 Agencies awarding one or more contracts to such an organization pursuant to the provisions of this subsection may use multiyear contracts, if appropriate.




(d)
 Priority
For purposes of this section priority shall be given to the awarding of contracts and the placement of subcontracts to small business concerns which shall perform a substantial proportion of the production on those contracts and subcontracts within areas of concentrated unemployment or underemployment or within labor surplus areas. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, total labor surplus area set-asides pursuant to Defense Manpower Policy Number 4 (32A C.F.R. Chapter 1) or any successor policy shall be authorized if the Secretary or his designee specifically determines that there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from a sufficient number of eligible concerns so that awards will be made at reasonable prices. As soon as practicable and to the extent possible, in determining labor surplus areas, consideration shall be given to those persons who would be available for employment were suitable employment available. Until such definition reflects such number, the present criteria of such policy shall govern.




(e)
 Procurement strategies; contract bundling
(1)
 In general
To the maximum extent practicable, procurement strategies used by a Federal department or agency having contracting authority shall facilitate the maximum participation of small business concerns as prime contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers, and each such Federal department or agency shall—
(A)
 provide opportunities for the participation of small business concerns during acquisition planning processes and in acquisition plans; and




(B)
 invite the participation of the appropriate Director of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization in acquisition planning processes and provide that Director access to acquisition plans.






(2)
 Market research
(A)
 In general
Before proceeding with an acquisition strategy that could lead to a contract containing consolidated procurement requirements, the head of an agency shall conduct market research to determine whether consolidation of the requirements is necessary and justified.






(B)
 Factors
For purposes of subparagraph (A), consolidation of the requirements may be determined as being necessary and justified if, as compared to the benefits that would be derived from contracting to meet those requirements if not consolidated, the Federal Government would derive from the consolidation measurably substantial benefits, including any combination of benefits that, in combination, are measurably substantial. Benefits described in the preceding sentence may include the following:
(i)
 Cost savings.




(ii)
 Quality improvements.




(iii)
 Reduction in acquisition cycle times.




(iv)
 Better terms and conditions.




(v)
 Any other benefits.






(C)
 Reduction of costs not determinative
The reduction of administrative or personnel costs alone shall not be a justification for bundling of contract requirements unless the cost savings are expected to be substantial in relation to the dollar value of the procurement requirements to be consolidated.








(3)
 Strategy specifications
If the head of a contracting agency determines that a proposed procurement strategy for a procurement involves a substantial bundling of contract requirements, the proposed procurement strategy shall—
(A)
 identify specifically the benefits anticipated to be derived from the bundling of contract requirements;




(B)
 set forth an assessment of the specific impediments to participation by small business concerns as prime contractors that result from the bundling of contract requirements and specify actions designed to maximize small business participation as subcontractors (including suppliers) at various tiers under the contract or contracts that are awarded to meet the requirements; and




(C)
 include a specific determination that the anticipated benefits of the proposed bundled contract justify its use.






(4)
 Contract teaming
In the case of a solicitation of offers for a bundled contract that is issued by the head of an agency, a small-business concern may submit an offer that provides for use of a particular team of subcontractors for the performance of the contract. The head of the agency shall evaluate the offer in the same manner as other offers, with due consideration to the capabilities of all of the proposed subcontractors. If a small business concern teams under this paragraph, it shall not affect its status as a small business concern for any other purpose.

(D)
 After establishing goals under this paragraph for a fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall develop a plan for achieving such goals at both the prime contract and the subcontract level, which shall apportion responsibilities among the agency’s acquisition executives and officials. In establishing goals under this paragraph, the head of each Federal agency shall make a consistent effort to annually expand participation by small business concerns from each industry category in procurement contracts and subcontracts of such agency, including participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women.

section 637(a) of this title
.

 First tier subcontracts that are awarded by Management and Operating contractors sponsored by the Department of Energy to small business concerns, small businesses concerns owned and controlled by service disabled veterans, qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women, shall be considered toward the annually established agency and Government-wide goals for procurement contracts awarded.




(h)

(1)
 Agency reports
At the conclusion of each fiscal year, the head of each Federal agency shall submit to the Administrator a report describing—
(A)
 the extent of the participation by small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by veterans (including service-disabled veterans), qualified HUBZone small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and small business concerns owned and controlled by women in the procurement contracts of such agency during such fiscal year;
