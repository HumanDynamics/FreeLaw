COMPETITIVENESS POLICY COUNCIL
 Findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—
(1)
 efforts to reverse the decline of United States industry has been hindered by—

 a serious erosion in the institutions and policies which foster United States competitiveness including a lack of high quality domestic and international economic and scientific data needed to—
(i)
 reveal sectoral strengths and weaknesses;




(ii)
 identify potential new markets and future technological and economic trends; and




(iii)
 provide necessary information regarding the competitive strategies of foreign competitors;






(B)
 the lack of a coherent and consistent government competitiveness policy, including policies with respect to—

 international trade, finance, and investment,




(ii)
 research, science, and technology,




(iii)
 education, labor retraining, and adjustment,




(iv)
 macroeconomic and budgetary issues,

 the United States economy benefits when business, labor, government, academia, and public interest groups work together cooperatively;

(4)
 the world is moving rapidly toward the creation of an integrated and interdependent economy, a world economy in which the policies of one nation have a major impact on other nations;

 integrated solutions to such issues as trade and investment research, science, and technology, education, and labor retraining and adjustments help the United States compete more effectively in the world economy; and
