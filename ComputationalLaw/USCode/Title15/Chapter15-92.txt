Chapter 92
YEAR 2000 COMPUTER DATE CHANGE
 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1)
(A)
 Many information technology systems, devices, and programs are not capable of recognizing certain dates in 1999 and after 
December 31, 1999
, and will read dates in the year 2000 and thereafter as if those dates represent the year 1900 or thereafter or will fail to process dates after 
December 31, 1999
.




(B)
 If not corrected, the problem described in subparagraph (A) and resulting failures could incapacitate systems that are essential to the functioning of markets, commerce, consumer products, utilities, Government, and safety and defense systems, in the United States and throughout the world.






(2)
 It is in the national interest that producers and users of technology products concentrate their attention and resources in the time remaining before 
January 1, 2000
, on assessing, fixing, testing, and developing contingency plans to address any and all outstanding year 2000 computer date-change problems, so as to minimize possible disruptions associated with computer failures.




(3)
(A)
 Because year 2000 computer date-change problems may affect virtually all businesses and other users of technology products to some degree, there is a substantial likelihood that actual or potential year 2000 failures will prompt a significant volume of litigation, much of it insubstantial.




(B)
 The litigation described in subparagraph (A) would have a range of undesirable effects, including the following:
(i)
 It would threaten to waste technical and financial resources that are better devoted to curing year 2000 computer date-change problems and ensuring that systems remain or become operational.




(ii)
 It could threaten the network of valued and trusted business and customer relationships that are important to the effective functioning of the national economy.




(iii)
 It would strain the Nation’s legal system, causing particular problems for the small businesses and individuals who already find that system inaccessible because of its complexity and expense.




(iv)
 The delays, expense, uncertainties, loss of control, adverse publicity, and animosities that frequently accompany litigation of business disputes could exacerbate the difficulties associated with the date change and work against the successful resolution of those difficulties.








(4)
 It is appropriate for the Congress to enact legislation to assure that the year 2000 problems described in this section do not unnecessarily disrupt interstate commerce or create unnecessary caseloads in Federal courts and to provide initiatives to help businesses prepare and be in a position to withstand the potentially devastating economic impact of such problems.




(5)
 Resorting to the legal system for resolution of year 2000 problems described in this section is not feasible for many businesses and individuals who already find the legal system inaccessible, particularly small businesses and individuals who already find the legal system inaccessible, because of its complexity and expense.




(6)
 Concern about the potential for liability—in particular, concern about the substantial litigation expense associated with defending against even the most insubstantial lawsuits—is prompting many persons and businesses with technical expertise to avoid projects aimed at curing year 2000 computer date-change problems.




(7)
 A proliferation of frivolous lawsuits relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems by opportunistic parties may further limit access to courts by straining the resources of the legal system and depriving deserving parties of their legitimate rights to relief.




(8)
 Congress encourages businesses to approach their disputes relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems responsibly, and to avoid unnecessary, time-consuming, and costly litigation about Y2K failures, particularly those that are not material. Congress supports good faith negotiations between parties when there is such a dispute, and, if necessary, urges the parties to enter into voluntary, nonbinding mediation rather than litigation.




(b)
 Purposes
Based upon the power of the Congress under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the Constitution of the United States, the purposes of this chapter are—
(1)
 to establish uniform legal standards that give all businesses and users of technology products reasonable incentives to solve year 2000 computer date-change problems before they develop;




(2)
 to encourage continued remediation and testing efforts to solve such problems by providers, suppliers, customers, and other contracting partners;




(3)
 to encourage private and public parties alike to resolve disputes relating to year 2000 computer date-change problems by alternative dispute mechanisms in order to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation, to initiate those mechanisms as early as possible, and to encourage the prompt identification and correction of such problems; and




(4)
 to lessen the burdens on interstate commerce by discouraging insubstantial lawsuits while preserving the ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real injury to obtain complete relief.

(3)
 Nondisclosure to jury
The standard for allocation of damages under subsection (a) of this section and subsection (b)(1) of this section, and the procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under paragraph (1) of this subsection, shall not be disclosed to members of the jury.

 In general
A defendant who is jointly and severally liable for damages in any Y2K action that is not a contract action may recover contribution from any other person who, if joined in the original action, would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of responsibility of the claimant and of each person against whom a claim for contribution is made.






(2)

 if the prospective defendant has designated a person to receive prelitigation notices on a Year 2000 Internet Website (as defined in section 3(7) of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act), to the designated person, if the prospective plaintiff has reasonable access to the Internet.




(c)
 Response to notice
(1)
 In general

 Effect of contractual or statutory waiting periods
In cases in which a contract, or a statute enacted before 
January 1, 1999

 Required state of mind
In any Y2K action in which a claim is asserted on which the plaintiff may prevail only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, there shall be filed with the complaint, with respect to each element of that claim, a statement of the facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.




 Duty to mitigate
(a)
 In general
Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, aware, including information made available by the defendant to purchasers or users of the defendant’s product or services concerning means of remedying or avoiding the Y2K failure involved in the action.

 Exception for intentional fraud
Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to damages suffered by reason of the plaintiff’s justifiable reliance upon an affirmative material misrepresentation by the defendant, made by the defendant with actual knowledge of its falsity, concerning the potential for Y2K failure of the device or system used or sold by the defendant that experienced the Y2K failure alleged to have caused the plaintiff’s harm.




 Application of existing impossibility or commercial impracticability doctrines

 Damages limitation by contract
 Damages in tort claims
(a)
 In general
A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim, other than a claim of intentional tort arising independent of a contract, may not recover damages for economic loss unless—
(1)
 the recovery of such losses is provided for in a contract to which the party seeking to recover such losses is a party; or




(2)
 such losses result directly from damage to tangible personal or real property caused by the Y2K failure involved in the action (other than damage to property that is the subject of the contract between the parties to the Y2K action or, in the event there is no contract between the parties, other than damage caused only to the property that experienced the Y2K failure),





and such damages are permitted under applicable Federal or State law.


(b)
 Economic loss
For purposes of this section only, and except as otherwise specifically provided in a valid and enforceable written contract between the plaintiff and the defendant in a Y2K action, the term “economic loss” means amounts awarded to compensate an injured party for any loss, and includes amounts awarded for damages such as—
(1)
 lost profits or sales;




(2)
 business interruption;




(3)
 losses indirectly suffered as a result of the defendant’s wrongful act or omission;




(4)
 losses that arise because of the claims of third parties;




(5)
 losses that must be pled as special damages; and




(6)
 consequential damages (as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code or analogous State commercial law).




(c)
 Certain other actions
A person liable for damages, whether by settlement or judgment, in a civil action to which this chapter does not apply because of 
section 6603(c) of this title
 whose liability, in whole or in part, is the result of a Y2K failure may, notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, pursue any remedy otherwise available under Federal or State law against the person responsible for that Y2K failure to the extent of recovering the amount of those damages.




 State of mind; bystander liability; control
(a)
 Defendant’s state of mind
In a Y2K action other than a claim for breach or repudiation of contract, and in which the defendant’s actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim, the defendant is not liable unless the plaintiff establishes that element of the claim by the standard of evidence under applicable State law in effect on the day before 
January 1, 1999
.




(b)
 Limitation on bystander liability for Y2K failures
(1)
 In general
With respect to any Y2K action for money damages in which—
(A)
 the defendant is not the manufacturer, seller, or distributor of a product, or the provider of a service, that suffers or causes the Y2K failure at issue;




(B)
 the plaintiff is not in substantial privity with the defendant; and




(C)
 the defendant’s actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim under applicable law,





the defendant shall not be liable unless the plaintiff, in addition to establishing all other requisite elements of the claim, proves, by the standard of evidence under applicable State law in effect on the day before 
January 1, 1999
, that the defendant actually knew, or recklessly disregarded a known and substantial risk, that such failure would occur.




(2)
 Substantial privity
For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), a plaintiff and a defendant are in substantial privity when, in a Y2K action arising out of the performance of professional services, the plaintiff and the defendant either have contractual relations with one another or the plaintiff is a person who, prior to the defendant’s performance of such services, was specifically identified to and acknowledged by the defendant as a person for whose special benefit the services were being performed.






(3)
 Certain claims excluded
For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), claims in which the defendant’s actual or constructive awareness of an actual or potential Y2K failure is an element of the claim under applicable law do not include claims for negligence but do include claims such as fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract or economic advantage.






(c)
 Control not determinative of liability
The fact that a Y2K failure occurred in an entity, facility, system, product, or component that was sold, leased, rented, or otherwise within the control of the party against whom a claim is asserted in a Y2K action shall not constitute the sole basis for recovery of damages in that action. A claim in a Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract for such a failure is governed by the terms of the contract.




(d)
 Protections of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act apply
The protections for the exchanges of information provided by section 4 of the Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act (
Public Law 105–271
) shall apply to any Y2K action.




 Appointment of special masters or magistrate judges for Y2K actions
Any district court of the United States in which a Y2K action is pending may appoint a special master or a magistrate judge to hear the matter and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
 Y2K actions as class actions
(a)
 Material defect requirement

(2)
 the court finds that the defect in a product or service as alleged would be a material defect for the majority of the members of the class.




(b)
 Notification
In any Y2K action that is maintained as a class action, the court, in addition to any other notice required by applicable Federal or State law, shall direct notice of the action to each member of the class, which shall include—

 a concise and clear description of the nature of the action;




(2)
 the jurisdiction where the case is pending; and




(3)
 the fee arrangements with class counsel, including the hourly fee being charged, or, if it is a contingency fee, the percentage of the final award which will be paid, including an estimate of the total amount that would be paid if the requested damages were to be granted.

 Dismissal or remand
A United States district court shall dismiss, or, if after removal, strike the class allegations and remand, any Y2K action brought or removed under this subsection as a class action if—
(i)
 the action is subject to the jurisdiction of the court solely under this subsection; and




(ii)
 the court determines the action may not proceed as a class action based on a failure to satisfy the conditions of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.






(B)
 Amendment; removal
Nothing in paragraph (A) shall prohibit plaintiffs from filing an amended class action in Federal or State court. A defendant shall have the right to remove such an amended class action to a United States district court under this subsection.
