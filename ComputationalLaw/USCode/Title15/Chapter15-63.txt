section 209 of title 35
, may grant a license to an invention which is federally owned, for which a patent application was filed before the signing of the agreement, and directly within the scope of the work under the agreement, for reasonable compensation when appropriate. The laboratory shall ensure, through such agreement, that the collaborating party has the option to choose an exclusive license for a pre-negotiated field of use for any such invention under the agreement or, if there is more than one collaborating party, that the collaborating parties are offered the option to hold licensing rights that collectively encompass the rights that would be held under such an exclusive license by one party. In consideration for the Government’s contribution under the agreement, grants under this paragraph shall be subject to the following explicit conditions:
(A)
 A nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license from the collaborating party to the laboratory to practice the invention or have the invention practiced throughout the world by or on behalf of the Government. In the exercise of such license, the Government shall not publicly disclose trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential within the meaning of 
section 552(b)(4) of title 5
 or which would be considered as such if it had been obtained from a non-Federal party.




(B)
 If a laboratory assigns title or grants an exclusive license to such an invention, the Government shall retain the right—
(i)
 to require the collaborating party to grant to a responsible applicant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license to use the invention in the applicant’s licensed field of use, on terms that are reasonable under the circumstances; or




(ii)
 if the collaborating party fails to grant such a license, to grant the license itself.






(C)
 The Government may exercise its right retained under subparagraph (B) only in exceptional circumstances and only if the Government determines that—
(i)
 the action is necessary to meet health or safety needs that are not reasonably satisfied by the collaborating party;




(ii)
 the action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations, and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the collaborating party; or




(iii)
 the collaborating party has failed to comply with an agreement containing provisions described in subsection (c)(4)(B) of this section.





This determination is subject to administrative appeal and judicial review under section 203(2)

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds and declares that—
“(1)
 the leadership of the United States in product and process quality has been challenged strongly (and sometimes successfully) by foreign competition, and our Nation’s productivity growth has improved less than our competitors over the last two decades;




“(2)
 American business and industry are beginning to understand that poor quality costs companies as much as 20 percent of sales revenues nationally, and that improved quality of goods and services goes hand in hand with improved productivity, lower costs, and increased profitability;




“(3)
 strategic planning for quality and quality improvement programs, through a commitment to excellence in manufacturing and services, are becoming more and more essential to the well-being of our Nation’s economy and our ability to compete effectively in the global marketplace;




“(4)
 improved management understanding of the factory floor, worker involvement in quality, and greater emphasis on statistical process control can lead to dramatic improvements in the cost and quality of manufactured products;




“(5)
 the concept of quality improvement is directly applicable to small companies as well as large, to service industries as well as manufacturing, and to the public sector as well as private enterprise;




“(6)
 in order to be successful, quality improvement programs must be management-led and customer-oriented and this may require fundamental changes in the way companies and agencies do business;




“(7)
 several major industrial nations have successfully coupled rigorous private sector quality audits with national awards giving special recognition to those enterprises the audits identify as the very best; and




“(8)
 a national quality award program of this kind in the United States would help improve quality and productivity by—
“(A)
 helping to stimulate American companies to improve quality and productivity for the pride of recognition while obtaining a competitive edge through increased profits,




“(B)
 recognizing the achievements of those companies which improve the quality of their goods and services and providing an example to others,




“(C)
 establishing guidelines and criteria that can be used by business, industrial, governmental, and other organizations in evaluating their own quality improvement efforts, and




“(D)
 providing specific guidance for other American organizations that wish to learn how to manage for high quality by making available detailed information on how winning organizations were able to change their cultures and achieve eminence.






“(b)
 
Purpose
.—
It is the purpose of this Act [enacting this section, amending 
section 3708 of this title
, and enacting provisions set out as a note under 
section 3701 of this title
] to provide for the establishment and conduct of a national quality improvement program under which (1) awards are given to selected companies and other organizations in the United States that practice effective quality management and as a result make significant improvements in the quality of their goods and services, and (2) information is disseminated about the successful strategies and programs.”
