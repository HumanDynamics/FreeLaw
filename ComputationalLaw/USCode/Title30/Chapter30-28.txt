Chapter 28
MATERIALS AND MINERALS POLICY, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT
 Congressional statement of findings; “materials” defined
(a)
 The Congress finds that—
(1)
 the availability of materials is essential for national security, economic well-being, and industrial production;




(2)
 the availability of materials is affected by the stability of foreign sources of essential industrial materials, instability of materials markets, international competition and demand for materials, the need for energy and materials conservation, and the enhancement of environmental quality;




(3)
 extraction, production, processing, use, recycling, and disposal of materials are closely linked with national concerns for energy and the environment;




(4)
 the United States is strongly interdependent with other nations through international trade in materials and other products;




(5)
 technological innovation and research and development are important factors which contribute to the availability and use of materials;




(6)
 the United States lacks a coherent national materials policy and a coordinated program to assure the availability of materials critical for national economic well-being, national defense, and industrial production, including interstate commerce and foreign trade; and




(7)
 notwithstanding the enactment of 
section 21a of this title
, the United States does not have a coherent national materials and minerals policy.




(b)
 As used in this chapter, the term “materials” means substances, including minerals, of current or potential use that will be needed to supply the industrial, military, and essential civilian needs of the United States in the production of goods or services, including those which are primarily imported or for which there is a prospect of shortages or uncertain supply, or which present opportunities in terms of new physical properties, use, recycling, disposal or substitution, with the exclusion of food and of energy fuels used as such.

 Program administration
(a)
 President; preparation of plan and submission to Congress of report
Within 1 year after

The plan shall include program and budget proposals and organizational structures providing for the following minimum elements:
(A)
 policy analysis and decision determination within the Executive Office of the President;




(B)
 continuing long-range analysis of materials use to meet national security, economic, industrial and social needs; the adequacy and stability of supplies; and the industrial and economic implications of supply shortages or disruptions;




(C)
 continuing private sector consultation in Federal materials programs; and




(D)
 interagency coordination at the level of the President’s Cabinet;






(2)
 recommendations for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information concerning domestic and international long-range materials demand, supply and needs, including consideration of the establishment of a separate materials information agency patterned after the Bureau of Labor Statistics; and




(3)
 recommendations for legislation and administrative initiatives necessary to reconcile policy conflicts and to establish programs and institutional structures necessary to achieve the goals of a national materials policy.




(b)
 Director of Office of Science and Technology Policy; coordination, etc., activities

(1)
 through the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology coordinate Federal materials research and development and related activities in accordance with the policies and objectives established in this chapter;




(2)
 place special emphasis on the long-range assessment of national materials needs related to scientific and technological concerns and the research and development, Federal and private, necessary to meet those needs; and




(3)
 prepare an assessment of national materials needs related to scientific and technological changes over the next five years. Such assessment shall be revised on an annual basis. Where possible, the Director shall extend the assessment in 10- and 25-year increments over the whole expected lifetime of such needs and technologies.




(c)
 Secretary of Commerce; consultative, etc., requirements; identification and assessment activities

(2)
 within 1 year after 
October 21, 1980
, submit to the Congress a report which assesses critical materials needs in the case identified in paragraph (1) of this subsection, and which recommends programs that would assist in meeting such needs, including an assessment of economic stockpiles; and
