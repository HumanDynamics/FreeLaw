GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
 Congressional statement of findings
 Loans for geothermal reservoir confirmation
(a)
 Authorization; purposes
The Secretary of Energy (hereafter in this chapter referred to as the “Secretary”) is authorized to make a loan to any person, from funds appropriated (pursuant to this subchapter) to the Geothermal Resources Development Fund established under 
section 1144 of this title
, to assist such person in undertaking and carrying out a project which (1) is designed to explore for or determine the economic viability of a geothermal reservoir and (2) consists of surface exploration and the drilling of one or more exploratory wells.




(b)
 Repayment rates
Subject to subsection (c) of this section and to 
section 1513(b) of this title
, any loan under subsection (a) of this section shall be repayable out of revenue from production of the geothermal energy reservoir with respect to which the loan was made, at a rate, in any year, not to exceed 20 per centum of the gross revenue from the reservoir in that year; except that if any disposition of the geothermal rights to the reservoir is made to one or more other persons by the borrower, the full amount of the loan balance outstanding, or so much of the loan balance outstanding as is equal to the full amount of the compensation realized by the borrower upon such disposition, whichever is less, shall be repaid immediately. In any case where the reservoir is confirmed (as determined by the Secretary), the Secretary may impute a reasonable revenue for purposes of determining repayment if—
(1)
 reasonable efforts are not made to put such reservoir in commercial operation,




(2)
 the borrower (or any such other person) utilizes the resources of the reservoir without a sale of the energy or geothermal energy resources therefrom, or




(3)
 a sale of energy or geothermal energy resources from the reservoir is made for an unreasonably low price;





except that no such imputation of revenue shall be made during the three-year period immediately following such reservoir confirmation. In the event of failure to begin production of revenue (or, where no sale of energy or geothermal energy resources is made, to begin production of energy for commercial use) within five years after the date of such reservoir confirmation, the Secretary may take action to recover the value, not to exceed the amount of the unpaid balance of the loan plus any accrued interest thereon, of any assets of the project in question, including resource rights.


(c)
 Cancellation of unpaid balance and accrued interest
The Secretary may at any time cancel the unpaid balance and any accrued interest on any loan made under this section if he determines, on the basis of evidence presented by the loan recipient or otherwise, that the geothermal energy reservoir with respect to which the loan was made has characteristics which make that reservoir economically or technically unacceptable for commercial development.




(d)
 “Person” defined
As used in this subchapter, the term “person” includes municipalities, electric cooperatives, industrial development agencies, nonprofit organizations, and Indian tribes, as well as the entities included within such term under 
section 1 of title 1
.




 Loan size limitation
The amount of any loan made under 
 Loan interest rates; repayment periods
(a)
 Each loan made under 
section 1511 of this title
 shall bear interest at a discount or interest rate equal to the rate in effect (at the time the loan is made) for water resources planning projects under section 80 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (
42 U.S.C. 1962(d)
–17(a)).

).”


(b)
 Each such loan shall be for a term which the Secretary deems appropriate, except that no loan term shall exceed twenty years beyond the date on which production of energy or geothermal energy resources begins from the reservoir involved. If revenues are inadequate (as determined by the Secretary) to fully repay the principal and accrued interest within twenty years after production begins, any remaining unpaid amounts shall be forgiven.


 Program termination
No new loans shall be made under this subchapter after 
 Regulations
The Secretary shall promulgate regulations to carry out this subchapter no later than six months after 
 Authorizations
There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for loans under this subchapter not to exceed $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1981, and not to exceed $20,000,000 for each of the four succeeding fiscal years. Amounts so appropriated shall be deposited in the Geothermal Resources Development Fund for purposes of this subchapter, and shall remain available for such purposes until expended.
 Reservoir insurance program study
The Secretary shall conduct a detailed study of the need for and feasibility of establishing a reservoir insurance and reinsurance program incorporating the terms, conditions, and provisions set forth in 
 Establishment of program
(a)
 Authorization; requirements; scope
If the report of the Secretary submitted pursuant to 
section 1521 of this title
 affirmatively recommends the establishment of the program and the Congress by law (after review of such recommendation) specifically authorizes the establishment of the program, the Secretary shall establish and implement within six months after the date of the enactment of such authorization a program, in cooperation with the insurance and reinsurance industry, to provide reservoir insurance to qualified eligible applicants in accordance with this section.

(3)
 the term “risk” means the hazard that a reservoir of geothermal resources will cease to provide sufficient quantities of geothermal resources at minimum conditions required to maintain an economically or technically viable operation for utilization of the geothermal resource;




(4)
 the term “reasonable premiums” means premium amounts determined by the Secretary to be reasonable in light of the amount of investment subject to the risk and premiums charged in similar or analogous situations by private insurers where private insurance is concerned and by insurers or guarantors, both public and private, where public insurance is concerned;
