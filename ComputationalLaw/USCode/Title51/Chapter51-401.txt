Approach
.—
The Administrator may establish a program of competitively awarded grants available to teams of researchers that may include the participation of individuals from universities, industry, and government for the conduct of this research.




“(a)
 
National Aero-Space Plane Program
.—
The Secretary of Defense (hereafter in this section referred to as the ‘Secretary’) and the Administrator shall jointly pursue on a high priority basis a National Aero-Space Plane program whose objective shall be the development and demonstration, by 1997, of a primarily air breathing single-stage-to-orbit and long range hypersonic cruise research flight vehicle.
