COOPERATION FOR SAFETY AMONG SPACEFARING NATIONS
 Common docking system standard to enable rescue
In order to maximize the ability to rescue astronauts whose space vehicles have become disabled, the Administrator shall enter into discussions with the appropriate representatives of spacefaring nations who have or plan to have crew transportation systems capable of orbital flight or flight beyond low Earth orbit for the purpose of agreeing on a common docking system standard.
 Information sharing to avoid physical or radio-frequency interference
The Administrator shall, in consultation with other agencies of the Federal Government as the Administrator considers appropriate, initiate discussions with the appropriate representatives of spacefaring nations to determine an appropriate frame-work under which information intended to promote safe access into outer space, operations in outer space, and return from outer space to Earth free from physical or radio-frequency interference can be shared among the nations.
