REMOTE SENSING
 Definitions
 General responsibilities
 Pilot projects to encourage public sector applications
(a)
 
In General
.—
The Administrator shall establish a program of grants for competitively awarded pilot projects to explore the integrated use of sources of remote sensing and other geospatial information to address State, local, regional, and tribal agency needs.


(b)
 
Preferred Projects
.—
In awarding grants under this section, the Administrator shall give preference to projects that—
(1)
 make use of commercial data sets, including high resolution commercial satellite imagery and derived satellite data products, existing public data sets where commercial data sets are not available or applicable, or the fusion of such data sets;




(2)
 integrate multiple sources of geospatial information, such as geographic information system data, satellite-provided positioning data, and remotely sensed data, in innovative ways;




(3)
 include funds or in-kind contributions from non-Federal sources;




(4)
 involve the participation of commercial entities that process raw or lightly processed data, often merging that data with other geospatial information, to create data products that have significant value added to the original data; and




(5)
 taken together demonstrate as diverse a set of public sector applications as possible.




(c)
 
Opportunities
.—
In carrying out this section, the Administrator shall seek opportunities to assist—
(1)
 in the development of commercial applications potentially available from the remote sensing industry; and




(2)
 State, local, regional, and tribal agencies in applying remote sensing and other geospatial information technologies for growth management.




(d)
 
Duration
.—
Assistance for a pilot project under subsection (a) shall be provided for a period not to exceed 3 years.


(e)
 
Report
.—
Each recipient of a grant under subsection (a) shall transmit a report to the Administrator on the results of the pilot project within 180 days of the completion of that project.


(f)
 
Workshop
.—
Each recipient of a grant under subsection (a) shall, not later than 180 days after the completion of the pilot project, conduct at least one workshop for potential users to disseminate the lessons learned from the pilot project as widely as feasible.


(g)
 
Regulations
.—
The Administrator shall issue regulations establishing application, selection, and implementation procedures for pilot projects, and guidelines for reports and workshops required by this section.


 Program evaluation
(a)
 
Advisory Committee
.—
The Administrator shall establish an advisory committee, consisting of individuals with appropriate expertise in State, local, regional, and tribal agencies, the university research community, and the remote sensing and other geospatial information industries, to monitor the program established under 
section 60303 of this title
. The advisory committee shall consult with the Federal Geographic Data Committee and other appropriate industry representatives and organizations. Notwithstanding section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 App. U.S.C.), the advisory committee established under this subsection shall remain in effect until the termination of the program under 
section 60303 of this title
.


(b)
 
Effectiveness Evaluation
.—
Not later than 
December 31, 2009
, the Administrator shall transmit to Congress an evaluation of the effectiveness of the program established under 
section 60303 of this title
 in exploring and promoting the integrated use of sources of remote sensing and other geospatial information to address State, local, regional, and tribal agency needs. Such evaluation shall have been conducted by an independent entity.


 Data availability
The Administrator shall ensure that the results of each of the pilot projects completed under 
 Education
The Administrator shall establish an educational outreach program to increase awareness at institutions of higher education and State, local, regional, and tribal agencies of the potential applications of remote sensing and other geospatial information and awareness of the need for geospatial workforce development.
