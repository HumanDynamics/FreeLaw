INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING
 Findings and policy
(a)
 Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1)
 Presidential Decision Directive 42, issued on 
October 21, 1995
, ordered agencies of the executive branch of the United States Government to, inter alia, increase the priority and resources devoted to the direct and immediate threat international crime presents to national security, work more closely with other governments to develop a global response to this threat, and use aggressively and creatively all legal means available to combat international crime.




(2)
 Executive Order No. 12978 of 
October 21, 1995
, provides for the use of the authorities in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (
