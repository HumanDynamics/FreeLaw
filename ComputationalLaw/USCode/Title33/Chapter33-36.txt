 Rate of interest
Whenever a non-Federal interest is required or elects to repay an amount under this Act over a period of time, the amount to be repaid shall include interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the average market yields on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the reimbursement period, during the month preceding the fiscal year in which costs for the construction of the project are first incurred (or in the case of recalculation the fiscal year in which the recalculation is made), plus a premium of one-eighth of one percentage point for transaction costs; except that such rates for hydroelectric power shall be in accordance with existing law.
 Limitation on applicability of certain provisions in reports
If any provision in any report designated by this Act recommends that a State contribute in cash 5 percent of the construction costs allocated to non-vendible project purposes and 10 percent of the construction costs allocated to vendible project purposes, such provision shall not apply to the project recommended in such report.
 General applicability of cost sharing
Unless otherwise specified, the cost sharing provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all projects in this Act. The Federal share of any cost of a project authorized by this Act for which cost a Federal share is not established in this subchapter, shall be the share of such cost otherwise provided by law.

 Fish and wildlife mitigation
(a)
 Steps to be taken prior to or concurrently with construction

 In the case of any water resources project which is authorized to be constructed by the Secretary before, on, or after 
November 17, 1986
, construction of which has not commenced as of 
November 17, 1986
, and which necessitates the mitigation of fish and wildlife losses, including the acquisition of lands or interests in lands to mitigate losses to fish and wildlife, as a result of such project, such mitigation, including acquisition of the lands or interests—
(A)
 shall be undertaken or acquired before any construction of the project (other than such acquisition) commences, or




(B)
 shall be undertaken or acquired concurrently with lands and interests in lands for project purposes (other than mitigation of fish and wildlife losses),





whichever the Secretary determines is appropriate, except that any physical construction required for the purposes of mitigation may be undertaken concurrently with the physical construction of such project.




(2)
 For the purposes of this subsection, any project authorized before 
November 17, 1986
, on which more than 50 percent of the land needed for the project, exclusive of mitigation lands, has been acquired shall be deemed to have commenced construction under this subsection.




(b)
 Acquisition of lands or interests in lands for mitigation
(1)
 After consultation with appropriate Federal and non-Federal agencies, the Secretary is authorized to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife resulting from any water resources project under his jurisdiction, whether completed, under construction, or to be constructed. Such mitigation may include the acquisition of lands, or interests therein, except that—
(A)
 acquisition under this paragraph shall not be by condemnation in the case of projects completed as of 
November 17, 1986

(B)
 acquisition of water, or interests therein, under this paragraph, shall not be by condemnation.





The Secretary, shall, under the terms of this paragraph, obligate no more than $30,000,000 in any fiscal year. With respect to any water resources project, the authority under this subsection shall not apply to measures that cost more than $7,500,000 or 10 percent of the cost of the project, whichever is greater.




(2)
 Whenever, after his review, the Secretary determines that such mitigation features under this subsection are likely to require condemnation under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall transmit to Congress a report on such proposed modification, together with his recommendations.




(c)
 Allocation of mitigation costs
Costs incurred after 
November 17, 1986
, including lands, easements, rights-of-way, and relocations, for implementation and operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation to mitigate damages to fish and wildlife shall be allocated among authorized project purposes in accordance with applicable cost allocation procedures, and shall be subject to cost sharing or reimbursement to the same extent as such other project costs are shared or reimbursed, except that when such costs are covered by contracts entered into prior to 
November 17, 1986
