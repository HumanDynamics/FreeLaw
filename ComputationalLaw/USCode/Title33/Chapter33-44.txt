(2)
 Coordination with the National Ocean Research Leadership Council (
10 U.S.C. 7902(a)
) to ensure that any integrated ocean and coastal observing system provides information necessary to monitor and reduce marine public health problems including health-related data on biological populations and detection of contaminants in marine waters and seafood.




(3)
 Development through partnerships among Federal agencies, States, academic institutions, or non-profit research organizations of new technologies and approaches for detecting and reducing hazards to human health from ocean sources and to strengthen understanding of the value of marine biodiversity to biomedicine, including—
(A)
 genomics and proteomics to develop genetic and immunological detection approaches and predictive tools and to discover new biomedical resources;




(B)
 biomaterials and bioengineering;




(C)
 in situ and remote sensors used to detect, quantify, and predict the presence and spread of contaminants in marine waters and organisms and to identify new genetic resources for biomedical purposes;




(D)
 techniques for supplying marine resources, including chemical synthesis, culturing and aquaculturing marine organisms, new fermentation methods and recombinant techniques; and




(E)
 adaptation of equipment and technologies from human health fields.






(4)
 Support for scholars, trainees and education opportunities that encourage an interdisciplinary and international approach to exploring the diversity of life in the oceans.




(d)
 Annual report
Beginning with the first year occurring more than 24 months after 
December 8, 2004
, the National Science and Technology Council, through the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall prepare and submit to the President and the Congress not later than January 31st of each year an annual report on the activities conducted pursuant to this title during the preceding fiscal year, including—
(1)
 a summary of the achievements of Federal oceans and human health research, including Federally supported external research, during the preceding fiscal year;




(2)
 an analysis of the progress made toward achieving the goals and objectives of the plan developed under subsection (b), including identification of trends and emerging trends;




(3)
 a copy or summary of the plan and any changes made in the plan;




(4)
 a summary of agency budgets for oceans and human health activities for that preceding fiscal year; and




(5)
 any recommendations regarding additional action or legislation that may be required to assist in achieving the purposes of this chapter.




 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Oceans and Human Health Initiative
(a)
 Establishment
As part of the interagency oceans and human health research program, the Secretary of Commerce is authorized to establish an Oceans and Human Health Initiative to coordinate and implement research and activities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration related to the role of the oceans, the coasts, and the Great Lakes in human health. In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall consult with other Federal agencies conducting integrated oceans and human health research and research in related areas, including the National Science Foundation. The Oceans and Human Health Initiative is authorized to provide support for—
(1)
 centralized program and research coordination;




(2)
 an advisory panel;




(3)
 one or more National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration national centers of excellence;




(4)
 research grants; and




(5)
 distinguished scholars and traineeships.




(b)
 Advisory panel
The Secretary is authorized to establish an oceans and human health advisory panel to assist in the development and implementation of the Oceans and Human Health Initiative. Membership of the advisory group shall provide for balanced representation of individuals with multi-disciplinary expertise in the marine and biomedical sciences. The Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to the oceans and human health advisory panel.




(c)
 National centers
(1)
 The Secretary is authorized to identify and provide financial support through a competitive process to develop, within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for one or more centers of excellence that strengthen the capabilities of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to carry out its programs and activities related to the oceans’ role in human health.




(2)
 The centers shall focus on areas related to agency missions, including use of marine organisms as indicators for marine environmental health, ocean pollutants, marine toxins and pathogens, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, seafood testing, identification of potential marine products, and biology and pathobiology of marine mammals, and on disciplines including marine genomics, marine environmental microbiology, ecological chemistry and conservation medicine.
