 conduct scientific voyages to locate, define, and document historic shipwrecks, submerged sites, and other ocean exploration activities that combine archaeology and oceanographic sciences;




(4)
 develop and implement, in consultation with the National Science Foundation, a transparent, competitive process for merit-based peer-review and approval of proposals for activities to be conducted under this program, taking into consideration advice of the Board established under 
section 3405 of this title
;




(5)
 enhance the technical capability of the United States marine science community by promoting the development of improved oceanographic research, communication, navigation, and data collection systems, as well as underwater platforms and sensor and autonomous vehicles; and




(6)
 establish an ocean exploration forum to encourage partnerships and promote communication among experts and other stakeholders in order to enhance the scientific and technical expertise and relevance of the national program.




(b)
 Donations
The Administrator may accept donations of property, data, and equipment to be applied for the purpose of exploring the oceans or increasing knowledge of the oceans.




 Ocean exploration and undersea research technology and infrastructure task force
(a)
 In general
The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in coordination with the National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the United States Geological Survey, the Department of the Navy, the Mineral Management Service, and relevant governmental, non-governmental, academic, industry, and other experts, shall convene an ocean exploration and undersea research technology and infrastructure task force to develop and implement a strategy—
(1)
 to facilitate transfer of new exploration and undersea research technology to the programs authorized under this subchapter and subchapter II of this chapter;




(2)
 to improve availability of communications infrastructure, including satellite capabilities, to such programs;




(3)
 to develop an integrated, workable, and comprehensive data management information processing system that will make information on unique and significant features obtained by such programs available for research and management purposes;




(4)
 to conduct public outreach activities that improve the public understanding of ocean science, resources, and processes, in conjunction with relevant programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and other agencies; and




(5)
 to encourage cost-sharing partnerships with governmental and nongovernmental entities that will assist in transferring exploration and undersea research technology and technical expertise to the programs.




(b)
 Budget coordination
The task force shall coordinate the development of agency budgets and identify the items in their annual budget that support the activities identified in the strategy developed under subsection (a).




 Ocean Exploration Advisory Board
(a)
 Establishment
The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall appoint an Ocean Exploration Advisory Board composed of experts in relevant fields—
(1)
 to advise the Administrator on priority areas for survey and discovery;




(2)
 to assist the program in the development of a 5-year strategic plan for the fields of ocean, marine, and Great Lakes science, exploration, and discovery;




(3)
 to annually review the quality and effectiveness of the proposal review process established under 
section 3403(a)(4) of this title
; and




(4)
 to provide other assistance and advice as requested by the Administrator.




(b)
 Federal Advisory Committee Act
Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.) shall not apply to the Board appointed under subsection (a).




(c)
 Application with Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act

 supersedes, or limits the authority of the Secretary of the Interior under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (
43 U.S.C. 1331
 et seq.).




 Authorization of appropriations
 Program established
(a)
 In general
The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall establish and maintain an undersea research program and shall designate a Director of that program.




(b)
 Purpose
The purpose of the program is to increase scientific knowledge essential for the informed management, use, and preservation of oceanic, marine, and coastal areas and the Great Lakes.




 Powers of program Director
 Administrative structure
(a)
 In general
The program shall be conducted through a national headquarters, a network of extramural regional undersea research centers that represent all relevant National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration regions, and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology.




(b)
 Direction
The Director shall develop the overall direction of the program in coordination with a Council of Center Directors comprised of the directors of the extramural regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology. The Director shall publish a draft program direction document not later than 1 year after 
March 30, 2009
, in the Federal Register for a public comment period of not less than 120 days. The Director shall publish a final program direction, including responses to the comments received during the public comment period, in the Federal Register within 90 days after the close of the comment period. The program director shall update the program direction, with opportunity for public comment, at least every 5 years.




 Research, exploration, education, and technology programs
(a)
 In general
The following research, exploration, education, and technology programs shall be conducted through the network of regional centers and the National Institute for Undersea Science and Technology:
