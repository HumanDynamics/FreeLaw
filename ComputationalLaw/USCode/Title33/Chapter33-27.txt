In considering appropriate locations, he shall, to the maximum extent feasible, utilize the recommended sites designated by the Administrator pursuant to 
section 1412(c) of this title
. In any case in which the use of a designated site is not feasible, the Secretary may, with the concurrence of the Administrator, select an alternative site. The criteria and factors established in 
section 1412(a) of this title
 relating to site selection shall be used in selecting the alternative site in a manner consistent with the application of such factors and criteria pursuant to 
section 1412(c) of this title
. Disposal at or in the vicinity of an alternative site shall be limited to a period of not greater than 5 years unless the site is subsequently designated pursuant to 
section 1412(c) of this title
; except that an alternative site may continue to be used for an additional period of time that shall not exceed 5 years if—
(1)
 no feasible disposal site has been designated by the Administrator;




(2)
 the continued use of the alternative site is necessary to maintain navigation and facilitate interstate or international commerce; and

Unless the Administrator grants a waiver pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, any permit issued by the Secretary shall require compliance with such criteria and restrictions.






(d)
 Waiver of requirements
If, in any case, the Secretary finds that, in the disposition of dredged material, there is no economically feasible method or site available other than a dumping site the utilization of which would result in non-compliance with the criteria established pursuant to 
section 1412(a) of this title
 relating to the effects of dumping or with the restrictions established pursuant to 
section 1412(c) of this title
 relating to critical areas, he shall so certify and request a waiver from the Administrator of the specific requirements involved. Within thirty days of the receipt of the waiver request, unless the Administrator finds that the dumping of the material will result in an unacceptably adverse impact on municipal water supplies, shell-fish beds, wildlife, fisheries (including spawning and breeding areas), or recreational areas, he shall grant the waiver.




(e)
 Federal projects involving dredged material
