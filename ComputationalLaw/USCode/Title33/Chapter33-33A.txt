Chapter 33A
MARINE DEBRIS RESEARCH, PREVENTION, AND REDUCTION
 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to address the adverse impacts of marine debris on the United States economy, the marine environment, and navigation safety through the identification, determination of sources, assessment, prevention, reduction, and removal of marine debris.
 NOAA Marine Debris Program
(a)
 Establishment of Program
There is established, within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Marine Debris Program to identify, determine sources of, assess, prevent, reduce, and remove marine debris and address the adverse impacts of marine debris on the economy of the United States, the marine environment, and navigation safety.




(b)
 Program components
The Administrator, acting through the Program and subject to the availability of appropriations, shall—
(1)
 identify, determine sources of, assess, prevent, reduce, and remove marine debris, with a focus on marine debris posing a threat to living marine resources and navigation safety;




(2)
 provide national and regional coordination to assist States, Indian tribes, and regional organizations in the identification, determination of sources, assessment, prevention, reduction, and removal of marine debris;




(3)
 undertake efforts to reduce the adverse impacts of lost and discarded fishing gear on living marine resources and navigation safety, including—
(A)
 research and development of alternatives to gear posing threats to the marine environment and methods for marking gear used in certain fisheries to enhance the tracking, recovery, and identification of lost and discarded gear; and




(B)
 the development of effective nonregulatory measures and incentives to cooperatively reduce the volume of lost and discarded fishing gear and to aid in gear recovery;






(4)
 undertake outreach and education activities for the public and other stakeholders on sources of marine debris, threats associated with marine debris, and approaches to identifying, determining sources of, assessing, preventing, reducing, and removing marine debris and its adverse impacts on the United States economy, the marine environment, and navigation safety, including outreach and education activities through public-private initiatives; and




(5)
 develop, in consultation with the Interagency Committee, interagency plans for the timely response to events determined by the Administrator to be severe marine debris events, including plans to—
(A)
 coordinate across agencies and with relevant State, tribal, and local governments to ensure adequate, timely, and efficient response;




(B)
 assess the composition, volume, and trajectory of marine debris associated with a severe marine debris event; and




(C)
 estimate the potential impacts of a severe marine debris event, including economic impacts on human health, navigation safety, natural resources, tourism, and livestock, including aquaculture.






(c)
 Grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts
(1)
 In general
The Administrator, acting through the Program, shall enter into cooperative agreements and contracts and provide financial assistance in the form of grants for projects to accomplish the purpose set forth in 
section 1951 of this title
.






(2)
 Grant cost sharing requirement
(A)
 In general
Except as provided in subparagraph (B), Federal funds for any grant under this section may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of such project. For purposes of this subparagraph, the non-Federal share of project costs may be provided by in-kind contributions and other noncash support.






(B)
 Waiver
The Administrator may waive all or part of the matching requirement under subparagraph (A) if the Administrator determines that no reasonable means are available through which applicants can meet the matching requirement and the probable benefit of such project outweighs the public interest in such matching requirement.








(3)
 Amounts paid and services rendered under consent
(A)
 Consent decrees and orders
If authorized by the Administrator or the Attorney General, as appropriate, the non-Federal share of the cost of a project carried out under this chapter may include money paid pursuant to, or the value of any in-kind service performed under, an administrative order on consent or judicial consent decree that will remove or prevent marine debris.






(B)
 Other decrees and orders
The non-Federal share of the cost of a project carried out under this chapter may not include any money paid pursuant to, or the value of any in-kind service performed under, any other administrative order or court order.








(4)
 Eligibility
Any State, local, or tribal government whose activities affect research or regulation of marine debris, and any institution of higher education, nonprofit organization, or commercial organization with expertise in a field related to marine debris, is eligible to submit to the Administrator a marine debris proposal under the grant program.






(5)
 Project review and approval
The Administrator shall—
(A)
 review each marine debris project proposal to determine if it meets the grant criteria and supports the goals of this chapter;




(B)
 after considering any written comments and recommendations based on the review, approve or disapprove the proposal; and




(C)
 provide notification of that approval or disapproval to the person who submitted the proposal.






(6)
 Project reporting
Each grantee under this section shall provide periodic reports as required by the Administrator. Each report shall include all information required by the Administrator for evaluating the progress and success in meeting its stated goals, and impact of the grant activities on the marine debris problem.

(d)
 Monitoring
The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, in cooperation with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall utilize the marine debris data derived under title V of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (
