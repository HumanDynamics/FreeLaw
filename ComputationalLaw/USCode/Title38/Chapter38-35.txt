Chapter 35
SURVIVORS’ AND DEPENDENTS’ EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE
 Purpose
The Congress hereby declares that the educational program established by this chapter is for the purpose of providing opportunities for education to children whose education would otherwise be impeded or interrupted by reason of the disability or death of a parent from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in the Armed Forces after the beginning of the Spanish-American War, and for the purpose of aiding such children in attaining the educational status which they might normally have aspired to and obtained but for the disability or death of such parent. The Congress further declares that the educational program extended to the surviving spouses of veterans who died of service-connected disabilities and to spouses of veterans with a service-connected total disability permanent in nature is for the purpose of assisting them in preparing to support themselves and their families at a standard of living level which the veteran, but for the veteran’s death or service disability, could have expected to provide for the veteran’s family.

(b)
 If any eligible person pursuing a program of education, or of special restorative training, under this chapter ceases to be an “eligible person” because—

 the parent or spouse from whom eligibility is derived is found no longer to have a “total disability permanent in nature”, as defined in 
section 3501(a)(8) of this title
,




(2)
 the parent or spouse from whom eligibility is derived based upon

 the parent or spouse from whom such eligibility is derived based upon subparagraph (E) of 
section 3501(a)(1) of this title
 no longer meets a requirement under clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of that subparagraph,





then such eligible person (if such person has sufficient remaining entitlement) may, nevertheless, be afforded educational assistance under this chapter until the end of the quarter or semester for which enrolled if the educational institution in which such person is enrolled is operated on a quarter or semester system, or if the educational institution is not so operated until the end of the course, or until 12 weeks have expired, whichever first occurs.

 the Secretary approves that beginning date;




(B)
 the eligible person elects that beginning date by not later than the end of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the Secretary provides written notice to that person of that person’s opportunity to make such election, such notice including a statement of the deadline for the election imposed under this subparagraph; and




(C)
 that beginning date—
(i)
 in the case of a person whose eligibility is based on a parent who has a service-connected total disability permanent in nature, is the date determined pursuant to subsection (d), or any date between the two dates described in subsection (d); and

 if the person otherwise eligible under paragraph (3) fails to elect a beginning date of entitlement in accordance with that paragraph, the beginning date of the person’s entitlement shall be the date of the Secretary’s decision that the parent has a service-connected total disability permanent in nature, or that the parent’s death was service-connected, whichever is applicable;




(5)
 if the person serves on duty with the Armed Forces as an eligible person after the person’s eighteenth birthday but before the person’s twenty-sixth birthday, then such period shall end 8 years after the person’s first discharge or release from such duty with the Armed Forces (excluding from such 8 years all periods during which the eligible person served on active duty before

 if the person becomes eligible by reason of a parent being listed in one of the categories referred to in

(A)
 if such person is enrolled in an educational institution regularly operated on the quarter or semester system and such period ends during a quarter or semester, such period shall be extended to the end of the quarter or semester; or




(B)
 if such person is enrolled in an educational institution operated on other than a quarter or semester system and such period ends after a major portion of the course is completed, such period shall be extended to the end of the course, or until 12 weeks have expired, whichever first occurs; and






(8)
 if the person is pursuing a preparatory course described in 
section 3002(3)(B) of this title
, such period may begin on the date that is the first day of such course pursuit, notwithstanding that such date may be before the person’s eighteenth birthday, except that in no case may such person be afforded educational assistance under this chapter for pursuit of secondary schooling unless such course pursuit would otherwise be authorized under this subsection.

 by reason of a service-connected disability that was determined to be a total disability permanent in nature not later than three years after discharge from service may be afforded educational assistance under this chapter during the 20-year period beginning on the date the disability was so determined to be a total disability permanent in nature, but only if the eligible person remains the spouse of the disabled person throughout the period.






(2)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in the case of any eligible person (as defined in section 3501(a)(1)(B), (C), (D), or (E) of this title) whose eligibility is based on the death or disability of a spouse or on a spouse being listed in one of the categories referred to in

October 1, 1980
, whichever is the latest, be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period for such length of time as the Secretary determines, from the evidence, that such person was so prevented from initiating or completing such program of education. When an extension of the applicable delimiting period is granted under the exception in the preceding sentence, the delimiting period will again begin running on the first day following such eligible person’s recovery from such disability on which it is reasonably feasible, as determined in accordance with regulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, for such eligible person to initiate or resume pursuit of a program of education with educational assistance under this chapter.

(1)
 Notwithstanding subsection (a) and subject to paragraph (2), an eligible person may be afforded educational assistance beyond the age limitation applicable to the person under such subsection if—

 the person suspends pursuit of such person’s program of education after having enrolled in such program within the time period applicable to such person under such subsection;




(B)
 the person is unable to complete such program after the period of suspension and before attaining the age limitation applicable to the person under such subsection; and

section 1720G(a) of this title
.




(ii)
 Conditions otherwise beyond the control of the person.

 Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the period of an individual as a primary provider of personal care services if the period concludes with the revocation of the individual’s designation as such a primary provider under 
section 1720G(a)(7)(D) of this title
.




(3)
 Educational assistance may not be afforded a person under paragraph (1) after the earlier of—
(A)
 the age limitation applicable to the person under subsection (a), plus a period of time equal to the period the person was required to suspend pursuit of the person’s program of education as described in paragraph (1); or




(B)
 the date of the person’s thirty-first birthday.

(e)
 No person made eligible by 
section 3501(a)(1)(C) of this title
