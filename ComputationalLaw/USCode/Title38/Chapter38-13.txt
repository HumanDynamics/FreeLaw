 Definitions
As used in this chapter—
 Determination of pay grade
(a)
 With respect to a veteran who died in the active military, naval, or air service, such veteran’s pay grade shall be determined as of the date of such veteran’s death or as of the date of a promotion after death while in a missing status.


(b)
 With respect to a veteran who did not die in the active military, naval, or air service, such veteran’s pay grade shall be determined as of—
(1)
 the time of such veteran’s last discharge or release from active duty under conditions other than dishonorable; or




(2)
 the time of such veteran’s discharge or release from any period of active duty for training or inactive duty training, if such veteran’s death results from service-connected disability incurred during such period and if such veteran was not thereafter discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable from active duty.




(c)
 The pay grade of any veteran described in 
section 106(b) of this title
 shall be that to which such veteran would have been assigned upon final acceptance or entry upon active duty.


(d)
 If a veteran has satisfactorily served on active duty for a period of six months or more in a pay grade higher than that specified in subsection (a) or (b) and any subsequent discharge or release from active duty was under conditions other than dishonorable, the higher pay grade shall be used if it will result in greater monthly payments to such veteran’s surviving spouse under this chapter. The determination as to whether an individual has served satisfactorily for the required period in a higher pay grade shall be made by the Secretary of the department in which such higher pay grade was held.


(e)
 The pay grade of any person not otherwise described in this section, but who had a compensable status on the date of such person’s death under laws administered by the Secretary, shall be determined by the head of the department under which such person performed the services by which such person obtained such status (taking into consideration such person’s duties and responsibilities) and certified to the Secretary. For the purposes of this chapter, such person shall be deemed to have been on active duty while performing such services.


 Cost-of-living adjustments
(a)
 In the computation of cost-of-living adjustments for fiscal years 1998 through 2013 in the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation payable under this chapter, such adjustments (except as provided in subsection (b)) shall be made by a uniform percentage that is no more than the percentage equal to the social security increase for that fiscal year, with all increased monthly rates (other than increased rates equal to a whole dollar amount) rounded down to the next lower whole dollar amount.


(b)
 For purposes of this section, the term “social security increase” means the percentage by which benefit amounts payable under title II of the Social Security Act (
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.) are increased for any fiscal year as a result of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (
42 U.S.C. 415(i)

 Deaths entitling survivors to dependency and indemnity compensation
(a)
 When any veteran dies after

(b)
 Dependency and indemnity compensation shall not be paid to the surviving spouse, children, or parents of any veteran dying after 
December 31, 1956
, unless such veteran (1) was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable from the period of active military, naval, or air service in which the disability causing such veteran’s death was incurred or aggravated, or (2) died while in the active military, naval, or air service.

(e)
 In the case of an individual who is eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation under this section by reason of 
section 103(d)(2)(B) of this title
 who is also eligible for benefits under another provision of law by reason of such individual’s status as the surviving spouse of a veteran, then, notwithstanding any other provision of law (other than

(2)
 Dependency and indemnity compensation shall be increased under this subsection only for months occurring during the two-year period beginning on the date on which entitlement to dependency and indemnity compensation commenced.




(3)

(4)

42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.) as a result of a determination made under section 215(i) of such Act (
42 U.S.C. 415(i)

 whose death occurs—

42 U.S.C. 402
) on the basis of such veteran’s wages and self-employment income but who would, upon application therefor, be entitled to such benefits if such veteran had been fully and currently insured at the time of such veteran’s death;





the Secretary shall pay for such month benefits under this section to each such survivor in an amount equal to the amount of the benefits which would have been paid for such month to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act (
42 U.S.C. 401
 et seq.), if such veteran had been both fully and currently insured at the time of such veteran’s death and if such survivor had filed application therefor on the same date on which application for benefits under this section is filed with the Secretary.


(b)
 In any case where the amount of dependency and indemnity compensation payable under this chapter to a surviving spouse who has children is less than the amount of pension which would be payable to (1) such surviving spouse, or (2) such children if the surviving spouse were not entitled, under chapter 15 of this title had the death occurred under circumstances authorizing payment of death pension, the Secretary shall pay dependency and indemnity compensation to such surviving spouse in an amount equal to such amount of pension.

 In the case of a child entitled to dependency and indemnity compensation who has attained the age of eighteen and who, while under such age, became permanently incapable of self-support, the dependency and indemnity compensation paid monthly to such child shall be increased by $286.


(b)
 If dependency and indemnity compensation is payable monthly to a person as a surviving spouse and there is a child (of such person’s deceased spouse) who has attained the age of eighteen and who, while under such age, became permanently incapable of self-support, dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid monthly to each such child, concurrently with the payment of dependency and indemnity compensation to the surviving spouse, in the amount of $488.

.




(4)
 If there is only one parent and such parent has remarried and is living with such parent’s spouse, dependency and indemnity compensation shall be paid to such parent under either paragraph (1) of this subsection or under subsection (d) of this section, whichever will result in the greater amount of such compensation being paid to such parent. In such a case of remarriage the total combined annual income of the parent and such parent’s spouse shall be counted in determining the monthly rate of dependency and indemnity compensation under the appropriate formula.




(c)
(1)
