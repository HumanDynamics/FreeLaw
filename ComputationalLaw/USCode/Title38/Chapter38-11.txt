(r)
 Subject to 
section 5503(c) of this title
, if any veteran, otherwise entitled to compensation authorized under subsection (
o
) of this section, at the maximum rate authorized under subsection (p) of this section, or at the intermediate rate authorized between the rates authorized under subsections (n) and (
o
) of this section and at the rate authorized under subsection (k) of this section, is in need of regular aid and attendance, then, in addition to such compensation—
(1)
 the veteran shall be paid a monthly aid and attendance allowance at the rate of $2,002; or




(2)
 if the veteran, in addition to such need for regular aid and attendance, is in need of a higher level of care, such veteran shall be paid a monthly aid and attendance allowance at the rate of $2,983, in lieu of the allowance authorized in clause (1) of this subsection, if the Secretary finds that the veteran, in the absence of the provision of such care, would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential institutional care.





For the purposes of clause (2) of this subsection, need for a higher level of care shall be considered to be need for personal health-care services provided on a daily basis in the veteran’s home by a person who is licensed to provide such services or who provides such services under the regular supervision of a licensed health-care professional. The existence of the need for such care shall be determined by a physician employed by the Department or, in areas where no such physician is available, by a physician carrying out such function under contract or fee arrangement based on an examination by such physician. For the purposes of 
section 1134 of this title
, such allowance shall be considered as additional compensation payable for disability.

For the purpose of this subsection, the requirement of “permanently housebound” will be considered to have been met when the veteran is substantially confined to such veteran’s house (ward or clinical areas, if institutionalized) or immediate premises due to a service-connected disability or disabilities which it is reasonably certain will remain throughout such veteran’s lifetime.


(t)
 Subject to 
section 5503(c) of this title
, if any veteran, as the result of service-connected disability, is in need of regular aid and attendance for the residuals of traumatic brain injury, is not eligible for compensation under subsection (r)(2), and in the absence of such regular aid and attendance would require hospitalization, nursing home care, or other residential institutional care, the veteran shall be paid, in addition to any other compensation under this section, a monthly aid and attendance allowance equal to the rate described in subsection (r)(2), which for purposes of 
section 1134 of this title
 shall be considered as additional compensation payable for disability. An allowance authorized under this subsection shall be paid in lieu of any allowance authorized by subsection (r)(1).

“(1)
 establish guidelines and (where appropriate) standards and criteria for the resolution of claims for benefits under laws administered by the Veterans’ Administration [now Department of Veterans Affairs] where the criteria for eligibility for a benefit include a requirement that a death or disability be service connected and the claim of service connection is based on a veteran’s exposure during service in connection with such veteran’s participation in atmospheric nuclear tests or with the American occupation of Hiroshima or Nagasaki, Japan, prior to 
July 1, 1946
, to ionizing radiation from the detonation of a nuclear device; and




“(2)
 ensure that, with respect to those claims, the policy of the United States described in section 2(13) [set out above] is carried out.




“(b)
(1)
(A)
 The guidelines required to be established in regulations prescribed under this section shall include guidelines governing the evaluation of the findings of scientific studies relating to the possible increased risk of adverse health effects of exposure to ionizing radiation. Those guidelines shall require that, in the evaluation of those studies, the Administrator [now Secretary] shall take into account whether the results are statistically significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review.




“(B)
 The evaluations described in subparagraph (A) shall be made by the Administrator of Veterans’ Affairs [now Secretary of Veterans Affairs] after receiving the advice of the Scientific Council of the Veterans’ Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards (established under section 6).

“(ii)
 If the Administrator [now Secretary] makes a determination, pursuant to this subparagraph, that service connection shall be granted in the case of a disease described in subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall specify in such regulations that, in the adjudication of individual cases, service connection shall not be granted where there is sufficient affirmative evidence to the contrary or evidence to establish that an intercurrent injury or disease which is a recognized cause of the described disease has been suffered between the date of separation from service and the onset of such disease or that the disability is due to the veteran’s own willful misconduct.




“(iii)
 With regard to each disease described in subparagraph (B), the Administrator [now Secretary] shall include in the regulations prescribed under this section provisions specifying the factors to be considered in adjudicating issues relating to whether or not service connection should be granted in individual cases and the circumstances governing the granting of service connection for such disease.
