 prohibiting enrollment of an eligible veteran in a program of education in which such veteran has “already qualified,” a veteran shall be allowed up to six months of educational assistance (or the equivalent thereof in part-time assistance) for the pursuit of refresher training to permit such veteran to update such veteran’s knowledge and skills and to be instructed in the technological advances which have occurred in such veteran’s field of employment during and since the period of such veteran’s active military service.

In any case in which independent study is combined with resident training, the educational assistance allowance shall be paid at the applicable institutional rate based on the total training time determined by adding the number of semester hours (or the equivalent thereof) of resident training to the number of semester hours (or the equivalent thereof) of independent study that do not exceed the number of semester hours (or the equivalent thereof) required for the less than half-time institutional rate, as determined by the Secretary, for resident training.

section 3687(b)(1) of this title
