Chapter 39
MINING ACTIVITY WITHIN NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM AREAS
 Congressional findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 the level of technology of mineral exploration and development has changed radically in recent years and continued application of the mining laws of the United States to those areas of the National Park System to which it applies, conflicts with the purposes for which they were established; and


(b)
 all mining operations in areas of the National Park System should be conducted so as to prevent or minimize damage to the environment and other resource values, and, in certain areas of the National Park System, surface disturbance from mineral development should be temporarily halted while Congress determines whether or not to acquire any valid mineral rights which may exist in such areas.


 Preservation and management of areas by Secretary of the Interior; promulgation of regulations
In order to preserve for the benefit of present and future generations the pristine beauty of areas of the National Park System, and to further the purposes of sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this title, and the individual organic Acts for the various areas of the National Park System, all activities resulting from the exercise of valid existing mineral rights on patented or unpatented mining claims within any area of the National Park System shall be subject to such regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior as he deems necessary or desirable for the preservation and management of those areas.
 Omitted
 Recordation of mining claims; publication of notice
All mining claims under the Mining Law of 1872, as amended and supplemented (30 U.S.C. chapters 2, 12A, and 16 and sections 161 and 162) which lie within the boundaries of units of the National Park System shall be recorded with the Secretary of the Interior within one year after 
 Damage to natural and historical landmarks; procedures for determination and enforcement of abatement of damaging activities
(a)
 Whenever the Secretary of the Interior finds on his own motion or upon being notified in writing by an appropriate scientific, historical, or archeological authority, that a district, site, building, structure, or object which has been found to be nationally significant in illustrating natural history or the history of the United States and which has been designated as a natural or historical landmark may be irreparably lost or destroyed in whole or in part by any surface mining activity, including exploration for or removal or production of minerals or materials, he shall notify the person conducting such activity and submit a report thereon, including the basis for his finding that such activity may cause irreparable loss or destruction of a national landmark, to the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, with a request for advice of the Council as to alternative measures that may be taken by the United States to mitigate or abate such activity.


(b)
 Omitted


 Severability
If any provision of this chapter is declared to be invalid, such declaration shall not affect the validity of any other provision herein.
 Civil actions for just compensation by mining claim holders
The holder of any patented or unpatented mining claim subject to this chapter who believes he has suffered a loss by operation of this chapter, or by orders or regulations issued pursuant thereto, may bring an action in a United States district court to recover just compensation, which shall be awarded if the court finds that such loss constitutes a taking of property compensable under the Constitution.
 Acquisition of land by Secretary
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary to acquire lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of any unit of the National Park System.
