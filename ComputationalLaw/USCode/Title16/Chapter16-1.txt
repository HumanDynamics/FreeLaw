 Protecting Americans from violent crime
(a)
 Congressional findings
Congress finds the following:
(1)
 The Second Amendment to the Constitution provides that “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed”.




(2)
 Section 2.4(a)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that “except as otherwise provided in this section and parts 7 (special regulations) and 13 (Alaska regulations), the following are prohibited: (i) Possessing a weapon, trap or net (ii) Carrying a weapon, trap or net (iii) Using a weapon, trap or net”.




(3)
 Section 27.42 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, provides that, except in special circumstances, citizens of the United States may not “possess, use, or transport firearms on national wildlife refuges” of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.




(4)
 The regulations described in paragraphs (2) and (3) prevent individuals complying with Federal and State laws from exercising the second amendment rights of the individuals while at units of—
(A)
 the National Park System; and




(B)
 the National Wildlife Refuge System.






(5)
 The existence of different laws relating to the transportation and possession of firearms at different units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System entrapped law-abiding gun owners while at units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System.




(6)
 Although the Bush administration issued new regulations relating to the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens in units of the National Park System and National Wildlife Refuge System that went into effect on 
January 9, 2009
—
(A)
 on 
March 19, 2009
, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction with respect to the implementation and enforcement of the new regulations; and




(B)
 the new regulations—
(i)
 are under review by the administration; and




(ii)
 may be altered.








(7)
 Congress needs to weigh in on the new regulations to ensure that unelected bureaucrats and judges cannot again override the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens on 83,600,000 acres of National Park System land and 90,790,000 acres of land under the jurisdiction of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.




(8)
 The Federal laws should make it clear that the second amendment rights of an individual at a unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System should not be infringed.




(b)
 Protecting the right of individuals to bear arms in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System
The Secretary of the Interior shall not promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an individual from possessing a firearm including an assembled or functional firearm in any unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System if—
(1)
 the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing the firearm; and




(2)
 the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the law of the State in which the unit of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System is located.




 Maintenance management system
(a)
 Implementation and elements
Beginning in fiscal year 1985, the National Park Service shall implement a maintenance management system into the maintenance and operations programs of the National Park System.

 a set of maintenance tasks that describe the maintenance work in each unit of the National Park System;




(3)
 a description of work standards including frequency of maintenance, measurable quality standard to which assets should be maintained, methods for accomplishing work, required labor, equipment and material resources, and expected worker production for each maintenance task;




(4)
 a work program and performance budget which develops an annual work plan identifying maintenance needs and financial resources to be devoted to each maintenance task;




(5)
 a work schedule which identifies and prioritizes tasks to be done in a specific time period and specifies required labor resources;




(6)
 work orders specifying job authorizations and a record of work accomplished which can be used to record actual labor and material costs; and




(7)
 reports and special analyses which compare planned versus actual accomplishments and costs and can be used to evaluate maintenance operations.

Provided further
, That authority to make payments under this subsection shall be effective only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Such contracts or cooperative agreements shall be subject to such other conditions as the Secretary may determine necessary to assure the adequate protection of Redwood National Park generally, and to provide employment opportunities to those individuals affected by this taking and to contribute to the economic revival of Del Norte and Humboldt Counties in northern California. The Secretary shall undertake and publish studies on erosion and sedimentation originating within the hydrographic basin of Redwood Creek with particular effort to identify sources and causes, including differentiation between natural and man-aggravated conditions, and shall adapt his general management plan to benefit from the results of such studies. The Secretary, or the Secretary of Agriculture, where appropriate, shall also manage any additional Federal lands under his jurisdiction that are within the hydrographic basin of Redwood Creek in a manner which will minimize sedimentation which could affect the park, and in coordination with plans for sediment management within the basin. To effectuate the provisions of this subsection, and to further develop scientific and professional information and data concerning the Redwood Forest ecosystem, and the various factors that may affect it, the Secretary may authorize access to the area subject to this subsection by designated representatives of the United States.

 Findings, purposes, and definitions
(a)
 Findings
The Congress makes the following findings:
(1)
 The Everglades National Park is a nationally and internationally significant resource and the park has been adversely affected and continues to be adversely affected by external factors which have altered the ecosystem including the natural hydrologic conditions within the park.

Findings
.—
The Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (
94 Stat. 2371
 [
Pub. L. 96–487
, see Short Title note set out under 
section 3101 of this title
]), enacted on 
December 2, 1980
, established Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and Gates of the Arctic Wilderness. The Village of Anaktuvuk Pass, located in the highlands of the central Brooks Range is virtually surrounded by these national park and wilderness lands and is the only Native village located within the boundary of a National Park System unit in Alaska.




“(2)
 Unlike most other Alaskan Native communities, the village [sic] of Anaktuvuk Pass is not located on a major river, lake, or coastline that can be used as a means of access. The residents of Anaktuvuk pass [sic] have relied increasingly on snow machines in winter and all-terrain vehicles in summer as their primary means of access to pursue caribou and other subsistence resources.




“(3)
 In a 1983 land exchange agreement, linear easements were reserved by the Inupiat Eskimo people for use of all-terrain vehicles across certain national park lands, mostly along stream and river banks. These linear easements proved unsatisfactory, because they provided inadequate access to subsistence resources while causing excessive environmental impact from concentrated use.




“(4)
 The National Park Service and the Nunamiut Corporation initiated discussions in 1985 to address concerns over the use of all-terrain vehicles on park and wilderness land. These discussions resulted in an agreement, originally executed in 1992 and thereafter amended in 1993 and 1994, among the National Park Service, Nunamiut Corporation, the City of Anaktuvuk Pass, and Arctic Slope Regional Corporation. Full effectuation of this agreement, as amended, by its terms requires ratification by the Congress.

 Findings and purpose
(a)
 The Congress finds that—
(1)
 archeological research in the San Juan Basin conducted over the past several years has greatly increased public knowledge of the scope of the prehistoric culture referred to as Chacoan Anasazi;




(2)
 the discoveries and the increased general interest in the Chaco phenomenon have come at a time when the San Juan Basin is experiencing extensive exploration and development for a wide variety of energy-related resources, including coal, uranium, oil, and natural gas;




(3)
 development of the San Juan Basin’s important natural resources and the valid existing rights of private property owners will not be adversely affected by the preservation of the archeological integrity of the area; and




(4)
 in light of the national significance of the Chacoan sites and the urgent need to protect them, continued cooperation between Federal agencies and private corporations is necessary to provide for development in the San Juan Basin in a manner compatible with preservation and archeological research.




(b)
 It is the purpose of this subchapter to recognize the unique archeological resources associated with the prehistoric Chacoan culture in the San Juan Basin and surrounding areas; to provide for the preservation and interpretation of these resources; and to facilitate research activities associated with these resources.

 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—
(1)
 The oldest and largest lava flow known on Earth is located on the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan. This volcanic activity produced the only place on Earth where large scale economically recoverable 97 percent pure native copper is found.




(2)
 The Keweenaw Peninsula is the only site in the country where prehistoric, aboriginal mining of copper occurred. Artifacts made from this copper by these ancient Indians were traded as far south as present day Alabama.




(3)
 Copper mining on the Keweenaw Peninsula pioneered deep shaft, hard rock mining, milling, and smelting techniques and advancements in related mining technologies later used throughout the world.




(4)
 Michigan Technological University, located in the copper district, was established in 1885 to supply the great demand for new technologies and trained engineers requested by the area’s mining operations. Michigan Technological University possesses a wealth of both written and photographic historic documentation of the mining era in its archives.




(5)
 Michigan’s copper country became a principal magnet to European immigrants during the mid-1800’s and the cultural heritage of these varied nationalities is still preserved in this remarkable ethnic conglomerate.




(6)
 The corporate-sponsored community planning in Calumet, Michigan, as evidenced in the architecture, municipal design, surnames, foods, and traditions, and the large scale corporate paternalism was unprecedented in American industry and continues to express the heritage of the district.




(7)
 The entire picture of copper mining on Michigan’s Keweenaw Peninsula is best represented by three components: the Village of Calumet, the former Calumet and Hecla Mining Company properties (including the Osceola #13 mine complex), and the former Quincy Mining Company properties. The Village of Calumet best represents the social, ethnic, and commercial themes. Extant Calumet and Hecla buildings best depict corporate paternalism and power, and the themes of extraction and processing are best represented by extant structures of the Quincy Mining Company.




(8)
 The Secretary of the Interior has designated two National Historic Landmark Districts in the proposed park area, the Calumet National Historic Landmark District and the Quincy Mining Company National Historic Landmark District.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this subchapter are—
(1)
 to preserve the nationally significant historical and cultural sites, structures, and districts of a portion of the Keweenaw Peninsula in the State of Michigan for the education, benefit, and inspiration of present and future generations; and




(2)
 to interpret the historic synergism between the geological, aboriginal, sociological, cultural technological, and corporate forces that relate the story of copper on the Keweenaw Peninsula.

 Findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1)
 In the Act of 
March 2, 1936
 (Chapter 113; 
49 Stat. 1155
; 
16 U.S.C. 423j
), Congress authorized the establishment of the Richmond National Battlefield Park, and the boundaries of the battlefield park were established to permit the inclusion of all military battlefield areas related to the battles fought during the Civil War in the vicinity of the City of Richmond, Virginia. The battlefield park originally included the area then known as the Richmond Battlefield State Park.




(2)
 The total acreage identified in 1936 for consideration for inclusion in the battlefield park consisted of approximately 225,000 acres in and around the City of Richmond. A study undertaken by the congressionally authorized Civil War Sites Advisory Committee determined that of these 225,000 acres, the historically significant areas relating to the campaigns against and in defense of Richmond encompass approximately 38,000 acres.




(3)
 In a 1996 general management plan, the National Park Service identified approximately 7,121 acres in and around the City of Richmond that satisfy the National Park Service criteria of significance, integrity, feasibility, and suitability for inclusion in the battlefield park. The National Park Service later identified an additional 186 acres for inclusion in the battlefield park.




(4)
 There is a national interest in protecting and preserving sites of historical significance associated with the Civil War and the City of Richmond.




(5)
 The Commonwealth of Virginia and its local units of government have authority to prevent or minimize adverse uses of these historic resources and can play a significant role in the protection of the historic resources related to the campaigns against and in defense of Richmond.




(6)
 The preservation of the New Market Heights Battlefield in the vicinity of the City of Richmond is an important aspect of American history that can be interpreted to the public. The Battle of New Market Heights represents a premier landmark in black military history as 14 black Union soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor in recognition of their valor during the battle. According to National Park Service historians, the sacrifices of the United States Colored Troops in this battle helped to ensure the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution to abolish slavery.




(b)

, made the subject of a variance under, or becomes for any reason an exception to, any applicable zoning ordinance approved under this section; and




(2)
 such variance or exception results, or will result, in such property being used in a manner that fails to conform to any applicable standard contained in regulations of the Secretary issued pursuant to this section and in effect at the time such variance or exception took effect;

 Interim measures
Pending completion of the developments and improvements referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall permit the motorized towing of whitewater rafts in the section of the national river between Thurmond and Cunard when the volume of flow in the river is less than three thousand cubic feet per second.




 Flow management
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds that adjustments of flows from Bluestone Lake project during periods of low flow are necessary to respond to the congressional mandate contained in 
section 460m–23 of this title
 and that such adjustments could enhance the quality of the recreational experience in the segments of the river below the lake during those periods as well as protect the biological resources of the river.




(b)
 Report to Congress required
The Secretary of the Army, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior, shall conduct a study and prepare a report under this section. The report shall be submitted to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs of the United States House of Representatives not later than 
December 31, 1989
. Before submission of the report to these Committees, a draft of the report shall be made available for public comment. The final report shall include the comments submitted by the Secretary of the Interior and the public, together with the response of the Secretary of the Army to those comments.




(c)
 Contents of study
The study under this section shall examine the feasibility of adjusting the timing of daily releases from Bluestone Lake project during periods when flows from the lake are less than three thousand cubic feet per second. The purpose of such adjustment shall be to improve recreation (including, but not limited to, fishing and whitewater recreation) in the New River Gorge National River. Any such adjustments in the timing of flows which are proposed in such report shall be consistent with other project purposes and shall not have significant adverse effects on fishing or on any other form of recreation in Bluestone Lake or in any segment of the river below Bluestone Lake. The study shall assess the effects of such flow adjustments on the quality of recreation on the river in the segments of the river between Hinton and Thurmond and between Thurmond and the downstream boundary of the New River Gorge National River, taking into account the levels of recreational visitation in each of such segments.




(d)
 Test procedures
As part of the study under this section, the Secretary of the Army shall conduct test releases from Bluestone Lake project during twenty-four-hour periods during the summer of 1989 when flows are less than three thousand cubic feet per second from the project. All such adjustments shall conform to the criteria specified in subsection (c) of this section. The tests shall provide adjustments in the timing of daily flows from Bluestone Lake project which permit flows higher than the twenty-four-hour average to reach downstream recreational segments of the river during morning and afternoon hours. The tests shall develop specific data on the effects of flow adjustments on the speed of the current and on water surface levels in those segments. No test shall be conducted when flows from the lake are less than one thousand seven hundred cubic feet per second and no test shall reduce flows below that level.

 the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area in the State of Georgia is a nationally significant resource;




“(2)
 the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area has been adversely affected by land use changes occurring inside and outside the recreation area;




“(3)
 the population of the metropolitan Atlanta area continues to expand northward, leaving dwindling opportunities to protect the scenic, recreational, natural, and historical values of the 2,000-foot-wide corridor adjacent to each bank of the Chattahoochee River and its impoundments in the 48-mile segment known as the ‘area of national concern’;




“(4)
 the State of Georgia has enacted the Metropolitan River Protection Act to ensure protection of the corridor located within 2,000 feet of each bank of the Chattahoochee River, or the corridor located within the 100-year floodplain, whichever is larger;




“(5)
 the corridor located within the 100-year floodplain includes the area of national concern;




“(6)
 since establishment of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, visitor use of the recreation area has shifted dramatically from waterborne to water-related and land-based activities;




“(7)
 the State of Georgia and political subdivisions of the State along the Chattahoochee River have indicated willingness to join in a cooperative effort with the United States to link existing units of the recreation area through a series of linear corridors to be established within the area of national concern and elsewhere on the river; and




“(8)
 if Congress appropriates funds in support of the cooperative effort described in paragraph (7), funding from the State, political subdivisions of the State, private foundations, corporate entities, private individuals, and other sources will be available to fund more than half the estimated cost of the cooperative effort.




“(b)
 
Purposes
.—

 to increase the level of protection of the open spaces within the area of national concern along the Chattahoochee River and to enhance visitor enjoyment of the open spaces by adding land-based linear corridors to link existing units of the recreation area;




“(2)
 to ensure that the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area is managed to standardize acquisition, planning, design, construction, and operation of the linear corridors; and




“(3)
 to authorize the appropriation of Federal funds to cover a portion of the costs of the Federal, State, local, and private cooperative effort to add additional areas to the recreation area so as to establish a series of linear corridors linking existing units of the recreation area and to protect other open spaces of the Chattahoochee River corridor.”

 an identification and designation of public and private uses which are compatible with and which would not significantly impair the significant scenic, recreational, educational, scientific, natural, archeological, and public health benefits present in the zone and which would not have an adverse impact on the recreation area or on the air quality of the south coast air basin;




(B)
 a specific minimum land acquisition program which shall include, but not be limited to, fee and less than fee acquisition of strategic and critical sites not to be acquired by the Federal Government for public recreational and other related uses; and a program for the complementary use of State and local authority to regulate the use of lands and waters within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone to the fullest extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this section; and




(C)
 a recreation transportation system which may include but need not be limited to existing public transit.






(3)
 No plan submitted to the Secretary under this section shall be approved unless the Secretary finds the plan consistent with paragraph (2) and finds that—
(A)
 the planning commission has afforded adequate opportunity, including public hearings, for public involvement in the preparation and review of the plan, and public comments were received and considered in the plan or revision as presented to him;




(B)
 the State and local units of government identified in the plan as responsible for implementing its provisions have the necessary authority to implement the plan and such State and local units of government have indicated their intention to use such authority to implement the plan;




(C)
 the plan, if implemented, would preserve significant natural, historical, and archeological benefits and, consistent with such benefits, provide increased recreational opportunities for persons residing in the greater Los Angeles-southern California metropolitan area; and




(D)
 implementation of the plan would not have a serious adverse impact on the air quality or public health of the greater Los Angeles region.





Before making his findings on the air quality and public health impacts of the plan, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.




(4)
 Following approval of the plan with respect to the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, upon receipt of adequate assurances that all aspects of that jurisdiction’s implementation responsibilities will be adopted and put into effect, the Secretary shall—
(A)
 provide grants to the State and through the State to local governmental bodies for acquisition of lands, waters, and interests therein identified in paragraph (2)(B), and for development of essential public facilities, except that such grants shall be made only for the acquisition of lands, waters, and interests therein, and related essential public facilities, for park, recreation, and conservation purposes; and




(B)
 provide, subject to agreements that in the opinion of the Secretary will assure additional preservation of the lands and waters of the zone, such funds as may be necessary to retire bonded indebtedness for water and sewer and other utilities already incurred by property owners which in the opinion of the Secretary would if left outstanding contribute to further development of the zone in a manner inconsistent with the approved plan developed by the planning commission.

 Findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 The Congress finds that—
(1)
 certain lands on the Lolo National Forest in Montana have high value for watershed, water storage, wildlife habitat, primitive recreation, historical, scientific, ecological, and educational purposes. This national forest area has long been used as a wilderness by Montanans and by people throughout the Nation who value it as a source of solitude, wildlife, clean, free-flowing waters stored and used for municipal purposes for over a century, and primitive recreation, to include such activities as hiking, camping, backpacking, hunting, fishing, horse riding, and bicycling; and




(2)
 certain other lands on the Lolo National Forest, while not predominantly of wilderness quality, have high value for municipal watershed, recreation, wildlife habitat, and ecological and educational purposes.




(b)
 Therefore, it is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress that, to further the purposes of the Wilderness Act of 1964 (
16 U.S.C. 1131
) and the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (
16 U.S.C. 1600
), the people of the Nation and Montana would best be served by national recreation area designation of the Rattlesnake area to include the permanent preservation of certain of these lands under established statutory designation as wilderness, and to promote the watershed, recreational, wildlife, and educational values of the remainder of these lands.


 Rattlesnake Wilderness
(a)
 Designation of area
In furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act (
78 Stat. 890
; 
16 U.S.C. 1131
), certain lands within the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area as designated by this subchapter, which comprise approximately 33,000 acres as generally depicted as the “Rattlesnake Wilderness” on a map entitled “Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and Wilderness—Proposed”, and dated 
October 1, 1980
, are hereby designated as wilderness and shall be known as the Rattlesnake Wilderness.




(b)
 Administration
Subject to valid existing rights, the Rattle­snake Wilderness as designated by this subchapter shall be administered by the Secretary of Agriculture, hereafter referred to as the Secretary, in accordance with the provisions of the Wilderness Act [
16 U.S.C. 1131
 et seq.] governing areas designated by that Act as wilderness: 
Provided
, That any reference in such provisions to the effective date of the Wilderness Act shall be deemed to be a reference to the effective date of this subchapter.

ll
–1 and 460
ll
–2 of this title, by which the Secretary of the Interior may accept conveyance of title to these private lands for the United States and in exchange issue bidding rights that may be exercised in competitive coal lease sales, or in coal lease modifications, or both, under sections 2 and 3 of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (
30 U.S.C. 201(a)
, 203). Any lands so acquired shall become national forest lands under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture to be managed in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter and other laws applicable to the management of national forest lands. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to limit or diminish any existing authority of the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture to acquire private lands and interests therein in the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and Rattlesnake Wilderness. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to require any owner of the lands within or contiguous to the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area or Rattlesnake Wilderness to accept coal lease bidding rights in exchange for title to those private lands.




(2)
 The coal lease bidding rights to be issued may be exercised as payment of bonus or other payment required of the successful bidder for a competitive coal lease, or required of an applicant for a coal lease modification. The bidding rights shall equal the fair market value of the private lands or interests therein conveyed in exchange for their issuance. The use and exercise of the bidding rights shall be subject to the provisions of the Secretary of the Interior’s regulations governing coal lease bidding rights, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this subchapter, that are in effect at the time the bidding rights are issued.




(3)
 If for any reason, including but not limited to the failure of the Secretary of the Interior to offer for lease lands in the Montana portion of the Powder River Coal Production Region as defined in the Federal Register of 
November 9, 1979
 (44 F.R. 65196), or the failure of the holder of the bidding rights to submit a successful high bid for any such leases, any bidding rights issued in an exchange under this subchapter have not been exercised within two years from 
October 31, 1983
, the bidding rights may be used as a monetary credit, which shall be considered “money” within the meaning of section 35 of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920 (
30 U.S.C. 191
), against that portion of bonus payments, rental or royalty payments paid into the Treasury of the United States and retained by the Federal Government on any Federal coal lease won or otherwise held by the applicant, its successors or assigns. The holder of the bidding rights shall pay the balance due on such bonus payments, rental or royalty payments in cash for transmittal to the States in the same manner and in the same amounts as though the entire payment were made in cash under the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 as amended [
30 U.S.C. 181
 et seq.]. The bidding rights may be transferred or sold at any time by the owner to any other party with all the rights of the owner to the credit, and after such transfer, the owner shall notify the Secretary.




(4)
 It is the intent of Congress that the exchange of bidding rights for the private lands or interests therein authorized by this subchapter shall occur within three years of 
October 19, 1980
.




(5)
 In order to facilitate the exchange authorized by this subchapter, the Executive order captioned “Order of Withdrawal”, of 
June 6, 1929
, creating “Coal Reserve No. 1, Montana, No. 1”, is hereby revoked to the extent that it constitutes a withdrawal of the lands therein from disposal under the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, as amended [
30 U.S.C. 181
 et seq.].




(c)
 Exchange of lands involving Burlington Northern, Inc.
The exchange of lands involving Burlington Northern, Inc. shall be in accordance with the agreement entitled “Statement of Intent” entered into by Burlington Northern, Inc. and the Regional Forester of the United States Forest Service, Region 1, signed

, and it is the intent of Congress that this exchange shall occur within three years of 
October 19, 1980
.




(d)
 Non-Federal lands; water rights
(1)
 As non-Federal lands and interests in the Rat­tlesnake National Recreation Area are acquired,  the  lands  shall  become  part  of  the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area. As non-Federal lands and interests in the Rattlesnake Wilderness are acquired, the lands shall become part of the Rattlesnake Wilderness. The Secretary shall publish from time to time a notice of such classifications in the Federal Register. It is the intention of Congress that acquisition of the non-Federal lands shall be completed no later than three years after 
October 19, 1980
.




(2)
 Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to permit the Secretary to affect or diminish any water right which is vested under either State or Federal law on 
October 19, 1980
, nor the rights of the owner of such water right to the customary and usual access, including necessary motorized use over and along existing roads and trails to any facilities used in connection therewith, and the right to operate and maintain such facilities.




(e)
 Exchange of land owned by Montana Power Company for bidding rights
The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, shall consummate the exchange of the lands owned by the Montana Power Company within the boundaries of the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and Rattlesnake Wilderness by issuing bidding rights to the Montana Power Company which shall equal the negotiated cash equivalent of the fair market value of such Montana Power Company lands, as provided in the agreement of 
April 4, 1983
, signed by the authorized representatives of the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior and the Montana Power Company, except that adjustments in the “Cash Equivalency Rate” referred to in said agreement shall not exceed a rate determined by the Secretary of the Interior taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the remaining period during which the bidding rights may be used.

 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—
(1)
 select areas of undeveloped National Forest System lands in the State of Oklahoma possess outstanding natural characteristics which give them high values as wilderness and will, if properly preserved, contribute as an enduring resource of wilderness for the benefit of the American people;




(2)
 the Department of Agriculture’s second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II) and other studies of National Forest System lands in the State of Oklahoma and the related congressional review of such lands have identified areas which, on the basis of their landform, ecosystem, associated wildlife, and location, will help to fulfill the National Forest System’s share of a quality National Wilderness Preservation System;




(3)
 the Department of Agriculture’s second roadless area review and evaluation, of National Forest System lands in the State of Oklahoma and the related congressional review of such lands have also identified areas which do not possess outstanding wilderness attributes or which possess outstanding energy, mineral, timber, grazing, dispersed recreation and other values, and which should not be designated as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System but should be available for nonwilderness multiple uses under the land management planning process and other applicable laws;




(4)
 many areas of the Ouachita National Forest possess qualities that can only be expressed and utilized in such a manner that designation of such areas as a national recreation area is appropriate for the maximum potential and enjoyment of the area by the American people;




(5)
 select areas possess unique plant and tree species and plant communities that are significant in their occurrence, variety and location and warrant designation as botanical areas; and




(6)
 select areas possess unique scenic and wildlife qualities that designation of such areas as a national scenic area and a national scenic and wildlife area is appropriate for the preservation of the natural beauty and wildlife habitat for the enjoyment of the American people.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this subchapter are to—
(1)
 designate certain National Forest System lands in the State of Oklahoma as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System, in order to promote, perpetuate, and preserve the wilderness character of the lands, protect watersheds and wildlife habitat, preserve scenic and historic resources, and promote scientific research, primitive recreation, solitude, physical and mental challenge, and inspiration for the benefit of all the American people, to a greater extent than is possible in the absence of wilderness designation; and to ensure that certain other National Forest System lands in the State of Oklahoma be available for nonwilderness multiple uses; and




(2)
 designate certain National Forest System lands in the State of Oklahoma as a national recreation area, 2 botanical areas, a national scenic area, and a national scenic and wildlife area in order to enhance and further certain natural resources characteristics.

Findings
.—
The Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 Red Rock Canyon is a natural resource of major significance to the people of Nevada and the United States. It must be protected in its natural state for the enjoyment of future generations of Nevadans and Americans, and enhanced wherever possible.




“(2)
 In 1998, the Congress enacted the Southern Nevada Public Lands [Land] Management Act of 1998 (
Public Law 105–263
) [see Short Title of 1998 Amendment note set out under 
section 6901 of Title 31
, Money and Finance], which provided among other things for the protection and enhancement of Red Rock Canyon.




“(3)
 The Corporation owns much of the private land on Red Rock Canyon’s eastern boundary, and is engaged in developing a large-scale master-planned community.




“(4)
 Included in the Corporation’s land holdings are 1,071 acres of high-ground lands at the eastern edge of Red Rock Canyon. These lands were intended to be included in Red Rock, but to date have not been acquired by the United States. The protection of this high-ground acreage would preserve an important element of the western Las Vegas Valley viewshed.




“(5)
 The Corporation has volunteered to forgo development of the high-ground lands, and proposes that the United States acquire title to the lands so that they can be preserved in perpetuity to protect and expand Red Rock Canyon.




“(b)
 
Purposes
.—
The purposes of this title are:
“(1)
 To accomplish an exchange of lands between the United States and the Corporation that would transfer certain high-ground lands to the United States in exchange for the transfer of other lands of approximately equal value to the Corporation.




“(2)
