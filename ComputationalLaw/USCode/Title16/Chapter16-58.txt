 shall have 5 reinsurance years after the date on which such payments become subject to 
section 3811 of this title
 to develop and comply with an approved conservation plan so as to maintain eligibility for such payments.


(ii)
 Existing operations with prior violations





Notwithstanding 
section 3811(a) of this title
, in the case of a person that the Secretary determines would have been in violation of 
section 3811(a) of this title
 if the person had continued participation in the programs requiring compliance at any time after 
February 7, 2014
, and is currently in violation of 
section 3811(a) of this title

 Applicable reinsurance year





Ineligibility for the payment described in 
section 3811(a)(1)(E) of this title

The person shall not be required to meet a higher conservation standard than the standard applied to other highly erodible cropland located within the same area. If the person’s conservation plan requires structures to be constructed, the person shall have until 2 years after the expiration of such contract to comply with the conservation plan, or a longer period of time if the Secretary determines compliance is otherwise technically or economically not feasible, or such longer period is otherwise appropriate, before such person will be subject to program ineligibility with respect to such land under

(2)
 on highly erodible land that is planted or set aside in reliance on a determination by the Soil Conservation Service that such land was not highly erodible land, except that this paragraph shall not apply to any agricultural commodity that was planted or set aside on any land after the Soil Conservation Service determines that such land is highly erodible land; or




(3)
 on highly erodible land planted to alfalfa during each of the 1981 through 1985 crop years as part of a rotation practice approved by the Secretary, if the person has submitted a conservation plan, in which case, such person shall have until

(D)
 A wetland previously identified as a converted wetland (if the original conversion of the wetland was commenced before 
December 23, 1985
), but that the Secretary determines returned to wetland status after that date as a result of—
