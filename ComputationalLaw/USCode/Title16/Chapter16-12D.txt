 Administer, sell, and exchange lands, dedicate portions for public purposes, etc.
For the purposes of assisting in the permanent settlement of farm families, protecting project land, and facilitating project development, the Secretary is authorized to administer public lands of the United States in the project area and lands acquired under this section; to sell, exchange, or lease such lands; to dedicate portions of such lands for public purposes in keeping with sound project development; to acquire in the name of the United States, at prices satisfactory to him, such lands or interests in lands, within or adjacent to the project area, as he deems appropriate for the protection, development, or improvement of the project; and to accept donations of real and personal property for the purposes of this Act. Any moneys realized on account of donations for purposes of this Act shall be covered into the Treasury as trust funds.




(b)
 Terms of contracts; qualifications of applicants; prohibited disposals
Contracts, exchanges, and leases made under this section shall be on terms that, in the Secretary’s judgment, are in keeping with sound project development. In addition, land sale and exchange contracts shall be on a basis that, in the Secretary’s judgment, provides for the return, in a reasonable period of years, of not less than the appraised value of the land and improvements thereon. Qualification of applicants for the purchase of land for irrigation farming shall be prescribed as provided in 
section 433 of title 43
, notwithstanding any other provisions of law. No farm unit shall be sold to, and no contract to sell a farm unit shall be entered into with, any person, corporation, or joint-stock association which has theretofore purchased or entered into a contract to purchase a farm unit from the United States on the Columbia Basin project. The foregoing provisions of this subsection shall apply only to the sale of farm units which are suitable for settlement purposes. Farm units which, in the opinion of the Secretary, are not suitable for settlement purposes may be sold with a preference to resident project landowners as supplemental units, subject to the applicable irrigable acreage limitations on the delivery of water, but the purchasers thereof shall not be entitled to benefits of the Act of 
August 13, 1953
 (
67 Stat. 566
) [
43 U.S.C. 451
 et seq.] with respect thereto.




“(b)
 Of the property authorized to be sold under section 2 of this Act, lands in the town area occupied by dwelling units shall be sold in accordance with the following terms and conditions:
“(1)
 First priority to purchase shall be given to the tenant of the United States in the town area who occupies the land and dwelling unit to be sold. The land and dwelling unit shall be offered at the appraised value as established under section 5 less any applicable discounts under this Act. This right of priority shall expire unless a deposit of earnest money in an amount to be fixed by the Secretary is received by him before the expiration of sixty days after the date on which the property has been offered for sale, and the right of priority shall be deemed abandoned unless within an additional one hundred and eighty days the prospective purchaser shall have signed a contract to purchase the property.
“Any tenant having a priority under (1) who desires to continue to rent the property occupied by him rather than to purchase it may assign his priority to a person who has entered into a valid contract to lease the property back to him. The Secretary may permit such other assignments of priorities under (1) as he finds to be fair and equitable. Assignments under this paragraph shall be subject to such general rules and regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, including denial, in any instance where the Secretary in his judgment finds it proper, to the assignee concerned, or his successors, assigns, or legal representatives, of any discount in or rebate of the purchase price to which such person or persons would otherwise be entitled under this Act.






“(2)
 Second priority to purchase shall apply to property in the town area not purchased under (1) and shall be given to persons who are tenants of the United States in Federal housing in the town area or who would meet the requirements for eligibility to become such tenants under the most recent regulations of the Bureau of Reclamation for the assignment of persons to Federal housing in the town area. Applicants to purchase shall be placed in order of opportunity to choose pursuant to a public drawing, but spouses of such applicants shall not be entitled to apply. Sales shall be at the appraised value as established under section 5, less applicable discounts under this Act. Selection of dwelling units by successful applicants, to be accompanied by a deposit of earnest money fixed as under (1), shall be concluded within limits of time established by the Secretary, and thereafter the purchase shall be concluded in the same manner as provided under (1). A purchase under (1) or (2) shall render the purchaser and any spouse of such purchaser ineligible thereafter to purchase under either (1) or (2).

“(2)
 Land not purchased by the owner of the improvements (except church or hospital improvements) thereon under (1) shall be made available for sale for a period of thirty days to those eligible for purchase under subsection (f) of this section, and thereafter shall be opened to bids from the general public and sold to the highest responsible bidder.




“(3)
 Land with church or hospital improvements thereon which has not been purchased by the owners of the improvements under (1) may be disposed of by advertising and competitive bids, or by negotiated sale or other transfer at such prices and on such other terms and conditions as the Secretary shall determine to be fair and equitable.

Provided
, That where there is more than one lessee in a given improvement and the Secretary finds it impractical to offer each lessee an interest in the property, the Secretary, pursuant to such standards as he deems appropriate, shall designate an order of priority among such lessees for acceptance of the offer of sale of such property, which shall be sold at the appraised value as established under section 5 less applicable discounts under this Act and pursuant to such other terms and conditions as the Secretary deems proper. Any preference or priority right under this paragraph shall expire unless a deposit of earnest money in an amount to be fixed by the Secretary is received by the Secretary before the expiration of sixty days after the date on which the property has been offered for sale, and thereafter the purchase shall be concluded in the same manner as provided under subsection (b)(1) of this section.




“(2)
 Property referred to in (1) which is not under lease granted by the United States or which has not been purchased under (1) shall be made available for sale for a period of thirty days to those eligible for purchase under subsection (f) of this section and thereafter may be opened to bids from the general public and sold to the highest responsible bidder.

Applicants to purchase shall be placed in order of opportunity to choose pursuant to a public drawing. No application shall be accepted from the spouse of any applicant or from a person, or the spouse of such person, who owns, has owned, or has contracted to buy other residential property in the town area. Sales shall be at the appraised value as established under section 5 less applicable discounts under this Act, and selection and purchase under this priority by successful applicants shall be concluded within limits of time to be established by the Secretary.

“(f)
 Of the property in the town area authorized to be sold under section 2 of this Act, except that which is covered by subsections (b), (c)(3), and (e)(1) of this section, land not purchased by the holders of a priority or preference under this section shall, for thirty days following the period during which holders of a priority or preference could purchase the same, be offered for sale at the appraised value as established under section 5 less applicable discounts under this Act to persons leasing property in the town area from the United States for business or commercial uses. The Secretary may, in his discretion, permit more than one lot to be included in a single purchase, but only if the property to be purchased is compact and contiguous. If two or more applicants to purchase under this subsection desire the same property, their order of opportunity to purchase shall be determined pursuant to a public drawing. A purchase under this subsection shall render the purchaser and any spouse of such purchaser ineligible either to make an additional purchase under this subsection or to purchase the business or commercial property he is renting from the United States.

“(h)
 In all public sales of property under this Act to the highest responsible bidder, which shall include all sales of property to be sold in the Grand Coulee area, the Secretary shall reserve the right to reject all bids; and, in the event all bids are less than the appraised value of the property as established under section 5 or in the event no bids are received, the property shall be available for sale to the first taker from the general public at not less than aforesaid appraised value until all such property has been sold.

], at the effective date of the aforesaid contracts.

Aug. 30, 1957
], they shall be entitled to an additional discount in the purchase price (or rebate as appropriate) equal to 10 per centum of the aforesaid appraised value.

The amount so paid for any year upon any such property shall not exceed the taxes that would be paid to the State or subdivision as the case may be upon such property if it were not exempt from taxation thereby.




(b)
 Lands acquired by United States
