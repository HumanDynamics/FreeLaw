The Secretary and the city shall, each, forthwith appoint one member to such board and those two members shall select a third. In the event agreement cannot be reached on the third member within seven days after the appointment of the first two, the third member shall be appointed by the presiding judge of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon within seven days after being notified of such disagreement by either of the first two members. All of said members shall be qualified to make a scientific determination of the facts. The contentions of the city and the Secretary shall be submitted to the board in the form of written contentions of fact together with the evidence and analysis that tends to support the position being presented. The board shall forthwith consider and decide, on a scientific basis, the issues in disagreement by majority vote, taking into consideration the evidence and data presented by the parties and such other tests and data which the board by majority vote may require. The decision of such board shall be in the form of written findings of fact and conclusions based thereon and shall be final and binding on the parties. The Secretary and the city shall compensate their designees and share equally the compensation of the third member, and shall provide such technical and administrative support as required.

 Ski area permit rental charge
(a)
 In general
The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge a rental charge for all ski area permits issued pursuant to section 3 of the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 (
16 U.S.C. 497b
), the Act of 
March 4, 1915
 (
38 Stat. 1101
, chapter 144; 
16 U.S.C. 497
), or the 9th through 20th paragraphs under the heading “SURVEYING THE PUBLIC LANDS” under the heading “UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR” in the Act of 
June 4, 1897
 (
30 Stat. 34
, chapter 2), on National Forest System lands. Permit rental charges for permits issued pursuant to the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 shall be calculated as set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Permit rental charges for existing ski area permits issued pursuant to the Act of 
March 4, 1915
, and the Act of 
June 4, 1897
, shall be calculated in accordance with those existing permits: 
Provided
, That a permittee may, at the permittee’s option, use the calculation method set forth in subsection (b) of this section.




(b)
 Formula
(1)
 The ski area permit rental charge (SAPRC) shall be calculated by adding the permittee’s gross revenues from lift ticket/year-round ski area use pass sales plus revenue from ski school operations (LT+SS) and multiplying such total by the slope transport feet percentage (STFP) on National Forest System land. That amount shall be increased by the gross year-round revenue from ancillary facilities (GRAF) physically located on national forest land, including all permittee or subpermittee lodging, food service, rental shops, parking and other ancillary operations, to determine the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) subject to the permit rental charge. The final rental charge shall be calculated by multiplying the AGR by the following percentages for each revenue bracket and adding the total for each revenue bracket:
(A)
 1.5 percent of all adjusted gross revenue below $3,000,000;




(B)
 2.5 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $3,000,000 and $15,000,000;




(C)
 2.75 percent for adjusted gross revenue between $15,000,000 and $50,000,000; and




(D)
 4.0 percent for the amount of adjusted gross revenue that exceeds $50,000,000.





Utilizing the abbreviations indicated in this subsection the ski area permit fee (SAPF) formula can be simply illustrated as:





SAPF = ((LT + SS) × STFP) + GRAF = AGR; AGR × % BRACKETS


(2)
 In cases where ski areas are only partially located on national forest lands, the slope transport feet percentage on national forest land referred to in this subsection shall be calculated as generally described in the Forest Service Manual in effect as of 
January 1, 1992
. Revenues from Nordic ski operations shall be included or excluded from the rental charge calculation according to the percentage of trails physically located on national forest land.




(3)
 In order to ensure that the rental charge remains fair and equitable to both the United States and the ski area permittees, the adjusted gross revenue figures for each revenue bracket in paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually by the percent increase or decrease in the national Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year. No later than 3 years after 
November 12, 1996
, and every 5 years thereafter the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on Resources of the United States House of Representatives a report analyzing whether the ski area permit rental charge required by this section is returning a fair market value rental to the United States together with any recommendations the Secretary may have for modifications of the system.




(c)
 Payment
The rental charge set forth in subsection (b) of this section shall be due on June 1 of each year and shall be paid or prepaid by the permittee on a monthly, quarterly, annual or other schedule as determined appropriate by the Secretary in consultation with the permittee. Unless mutually agreed otherwise by the Secretary and the permittee, the payment or prepayment schedule shall conform to the permittee’s schedule in effect prior to 
November 12, 1996
. To reduce costs to the permittee and the Forest Service, the Secretary shall each year provide the permittee with a standardized form and worksheets (including annual rental charge calculation brackets and rates) to be used for rental charge calculation and submitted with the rental charge payment. Information provided on such forms shall be compiled by the Secretary annually and kept in the Office of the Chief, United States Forest Service.




(d)
 Effective date
The ski area permit rental charge set forth in this section shall become effective on 
June 1, 1996
 and cover receipts retroactive to 
June 1, 1995
: 
Provided
, That if a permittee has paid rental charges for the period 
June 1, 1995
, to 
June 1, 1996
, under the graduated rate rental charge system formula in effect prior to 
November 12, 1996
, such rental charges shall be credited toward the new rental charge due on 
June 1, 1996
. In order to ensure increasing rental charge receipt levels to the United States during transition from the graduated rate rental charge system formula to the formula of this section, the rental charge paid by any individual permittee shall be—
(1)
 for the 1995–1996 permit year, either the rental charge paid for the preceding 1994–1995 base year or the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section, whichever is higher;




(2)
 for the 1996–1997 permit year, either the rental charge paid for the 1994–1995 base year or the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section, whichever is higher; and




(3)
 for the 1997–1998 permit year, either the rental charge for the 1994–1995 base year or the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section, whichever is higher.





If an individual permittee’s adjusted gross revenue for the 1995–1996, 1996–1997, or 1997–1998 permit years falls more than 10 percent below the adjusted gross revenue for the 1994–1995 base year, the rental charge paid shall be the rental charge calculated pursuant to this section.


(e)
 Non-national forest land operations
Under no circumstances shall revenue, or subpermittee revenue (other than lift ticket, area use pass, or ski school sales) obtained from operations physically located on non-national forest land be included in the ski area permit rental charge calculation.




(f)
 “Revenue” and “sales” defined; limitations
To reduce administrative costs of ski area permittees and the Forest Service the terms “revenue” and “sales”, as used in this section, shall mean actual income from sales and shall not include sales of operating equipment, refunds, rent paid to the permittee by sublessees, sponsor contributions to special events or any amounts attributable to employee gratuities or employee lift tickets, discounts, or other goods or services (except for bartered goods and complimentary lift tickets offered for commercial or other promotional purposes) for which the permittee does not receive money.




(g)
 Minimum rental charge
In cases where an area of national forest land is under a ski area permit but the permittee does not have revenue or sales qualifying for rental charge payment pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the permittee shall pay an annual minimum rental charge of $2 for each national forest acre under permit or a percentage of appraised land value, as determined appropriate by the Secretary.




(h)
 Five-year phase-in of increase
Where the new rental charge provided for in subsection (b)(1) of this section results in an increase in permit rental charge greater than one-half of 1 percent of the permittee’s adjusted gross revenue as determined under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the new rental charge shall be phased in over a five-year period in a manner providing for increases of approximately equal increments.




(i)
 Construction with National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
To reduce Federal costs in administering the provisions of this section, the reissuance of a ski area permit to provide activities similar in nature and amount to the activities provided under the previous permit shall not constitute a major Federal action for the purposes of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (
42 U.S.C. 4331
 et seq.).




(j)
 Withdrawal from mining laws
Subject to valid existing rights, all lands located within the boundaries of ski area permits issued prior to, on or after

“(a)
 This section [enacting and amending provisions set out as notes below] shall be referred to as the ‘Interstate 90 Land Exchange Amendment’.


“(e)
 Section 604(b) [section 101(e) [title VI, § 604(b)] of 
Pub. L. 105–277
, set out below] is further amended by inserting the following before the colon: ‘except Township 19 North, Range 10 East, W.M., Section 4, Township 20 North, Range 10 East, W.M., Section 32, and Township 21 North, Range 14 East, W.M., W½W½ of Section 16, Township 12 North, Range 7 East, Sections 4 and 5, W.M., Township 13 North, Range 7 East, Sections 32 and 33, W.M., Township 8 North, Range 4 East, Section 17 and the S½ of 16, W.M., which shall be retained by the United States’.

“(f)
 After adjustment of the Appraisal, the values of the offered and selected lands, including the offered lands held in escrow, shall be equalized as follows:
“(1)
 the appraised value of the offered lands, as such lands and appraised value have been adjusted hereby, minus the appraised value of the offered lands to be placed into escrow, shall be compared to the appraised value of the selected lands, as such lands and appraised value have been adjusted hereby, and the Secretary shall equalize such values by the payment of cash to Plum Creek at the time that deeds are exchanged, such cash to come from currently appropriated funds, or, if necessary, by reprogramming; and

“(i)
 The deadline for the Report to Congress required by section 609(c) of the Interstate 90 Land Exchange Act of 1998 [section 101(e) [title VI, § 609(c)] of 
Pub. L. 105–277
, set out below] is hereby extended. Such Report is due to the Congress 18 months from the date of the enactment of this Interstate 90 Land Exchange Amendment [
Nov. 29, 1999
].”


“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress finds that—
“(1)
 certain parcels of private land located in central and southwest Washington are intermingled with National Forest System land owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary of Agriculture as parts of the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, Wenatchee National Forest, and Gifford Pinchot National Forest;




“(2)
 the private land surface estate and some subsurface is owned by the Plum Creek Timber Company, L.P. in an intermingled checkerboard pattern, with the United States or Plum Creek owning alternate square mile sections of land or fractions of square mile sections;




“(3)
 the checkerboard land ownership pattern in the area has frustrated sound and efficient land management on both private and National Forest lands by complicating fish and wildlife habitat management, watershed protection, recreation use, road construction and timber harvest, boundary administration, and protection and management of threatened and endangered species and old growth forest habitat;




“(4)
 acquisition by the United States of certain parcels of land that have been offered by Plum Creek for addition to the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and Wenatchee National Forest will serve important public objectives, including—
“(A)
 enhancement of public access, aesthetics and recreation opportunities within or near areas of very heavy public recreational use including—
“(i)
 the Alpine Lakes Wilderness Area;




“(ii)
 the Pacific Crest Trail;




“(iii)
 Snoqualmie Pass;




“(iv)
 Cle Elum Lake, Kachess Lake and Keechulus Lake; and




“(v)
 other popular recreation areas along the Interstate 90 corridor east of the Seattle-Tacoma Metropolitan Area;






“(B)
 protection and enhancement of old growth forests and habitat for threatened, endangered and sensitive species, including a net gain of approximately 28,500 acres of habitat for the northern spotted owl;




“(C)
 consolidation of National Forest holdings for more efficient administration and to meet a broad array of ecosystem protection and other public land management goals, including net public gains of approximately 283 miles of stream ownership, 14 miles of the route of the Pacific Crest Trail, 20,000 acres of unroaded land, and 7,360 acres of riparian land; and




“(D)
 a significant reduction in administrative costs to the United States through—
“(i)
 consolidation of Federal land holdings for more efficient land management and planning;




“(ii)
 elimination of approximately 300 miles of boundary identification and posting;




“(iii)
 reduced right-of-way, special use, and other permit processing and issuance for roads and other facilities on National Forest System land; and




“(iv)
 other administrative cost savings;








“(5)
 Plum Creek has selected certain parcels of National Forest System land that are logical for consolidation into Plum Creek ownership utilizing a land exchange because the parcels—
“(A)
 are intermingled with parcels owned by Plum Creek; and




“(B)
(i)
 are generally located in less environmentally sensitive areas than the Plum Creek offered land; and




“(ii)
 have lower public recreation and other public values than the Plum Creek offered land;








“(6)
 time is of the essence in consummating a land exchange because delays may force Plum Creek to road or log the offered land and thereby diminish the public values for which the offered land is to be acquired; and




“(7)
 it is in the public interest to complete the land exchange at the earliest practicable date so that the offered land can be acquired and preserved by the United States for permanent public management, use, and enjoyment.




“(b)
 
Purpose
.—
It is the purpose of this Act to further the public interest by authorizing, directing, facilitating, and expediting the consummation of the Interstate 90 land exchange so as to ensure that the offered land is expeditiously acquired for permanent public use and enjoyment.


“(a)
 
Condition and Conveyance of Offered Land

“(i)
 This authorization is predicated on Skamania County’s Board of Commissioners commitment to give foremost consideration to preservation of the overall integrity of the site and conservation of the educational and research potential of the site, including providing for access to and assurance of the continued administration and operation of forestry research on the adjacent Thornton Munger Research Natural Area.


“(j)
 The Secretary is further directed to cooperate with Skamania County to address applicable Federal and State environmental laws.


“(k)
