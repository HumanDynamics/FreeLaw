Chapter 49
FISH AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION
 Congressional findings and declaration of purpose
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds and declares the following:
(1)
 Fish and wildlife are of ecological, educational, esthetic, cultural, recreational, economic, and scientific value to the Nation.




(2)
 The improved conservation and management of fish and wildlife, particularly nongame fish and wildlife, will assist in restoring and maintaining fish and wildlife and in assuring a productive and more esthetically pleasing environment for all citizens.




(3)
 Many citizens, particularly those residing in urban areas, have insufficient opportunity to participate in recreational and other programs designed to foster human interaction with fish and wildlife and thereby are unable to have a greater appreciation and awareness of the environment.




(4)
 Historically, fish and wildlife conservation programs have been focused on the more recreationally and commercially important species within any particular ecosystem. As a consequence such programs have been largely financed by hunting and fishing license rev­enues or excise taxes on certain hunting and fishing equipment. These traditional financing mechanisms are neither adequate nor fully appropriate to meet the conservation needs of nongame fish and wildlife.




(5)
 Each State should be encouraged to develop, revise, and implement, in consultation with appropriate Federal, State, and local and regional agencies, a plan for the conservation of fish and wildlife, particularly those species which are indigenous to the State.




(b)
 Purpose
It is the purpose of this chapter—
(1)
 to provide financial and technical assistance to the States for the development, revision, and implementation of conservation plans and programs for nongame fish and wildlife; and




(2)
 to encourage all Federal departments and agencies to utilize their statutory and administrative authority, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with each agency’s statutory responsibilities, to conserve and to promote conservation of nongame fish and wildlife and their habitats, in furtherance of the provisions of this chapter.




 Definitions
 Conservation plans
 Approval of conservation plans and certain nongame fish and wildlife conservation actions
(a)
 Approval by Secretary of plans
(1)
 Any State may apply to the Secretary for approval of a conservation plan.




(2)
 Applications for the approval of conservation plans shall be made and reviewed by the Secretary in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.




(3)
 As soon as practicable, but not later than 180 days, after the date on which a State submits (or resubmits in the case of prior disapproval) an application for the approval of a conservation plan the Secretary shall—
(A)
 approve the conservation plan, and designate it as an approved conservation plan, if he determines that the plan—
(i)
 meets the requirements set forth in 
section 2903 of this title
, and




(ii)
 is substantial in character and design; or






(B)
 disapprove the conservation plan if he determines that—
(i)
 the plan does not meet the requirements set forth in 
section 2903 of this title
, or




(ii)
 to implement any part of the plan on the basis of the specifications, determinations, identifications, or priorities therein would threaten the natural stability and continued viability of any of the plan species concerned.







If the Secretary disapproves a plan, he shall give the State concerned a written statement of the reasons for disapproval and provide the State opportunity for consultation with respect to deficiencies in the plan and the modifications required for approval.




(b)
 Effect of approval of plans
If the Secretary approves the conservation plan of any State under subsection (a) of this section—
(1)
 that portion of such plan that pertains to wildlife conservation shall be deemed to be an approved plan for purposes of 
section 6(a)(1) of the Act of September 2, 1937
 (
16 U.S.C. 669e(a)(1)
), commonly referred to as the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act [
16 U.S.C. 669
 et seq.]; and




(2)
 that portion of such plan that pertains to fish conservation shall be deemed to be an approved plan for the purposes of 
section 6(a)(1) of the Act of August 9, 1950
 [
16 U.S.C. 777e(a)(1)
] commonly referred to as the Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration Act [
16 U.S.C. 777
 et seq.].




(c)
 Conservation actions
If the Secretary approves the conservation plan of any State under subsection (a) of this section, those conservation actions set forth in the plan which pertain to nongame fish and wildlife shall be deemed to be eligible as nongame fish and wildlife projects for which reimbursement is available under 
section 2905 of this title
.




(d)
 Nongame conservation actions in the absence of an approved plan
In the absence of an approved conservation plan, and on a showing of need by the State, the Secretary may deem certain conservation actions to be nongame fish and wildlife projects for which reimbursement is available under 
section 2905(a)(3) of this title
 if they—
(1)
 are consistent with such of the requirements set forth in 
section 2903 of this title
 as may be appropriate, including, but not limited to, the requirements in paragraphs (3), (4), (5), and (7) of such section; and




(2)
 are substantial in character and design.
