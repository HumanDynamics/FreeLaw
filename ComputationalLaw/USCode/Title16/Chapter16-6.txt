Provided further
, That no Federal funds shall be appropriated until the Governor of Florida executes an agreement on behalf of the State which (i) provides for the transfer to the United States of all lands within the preserve previously owned or acquired by the State and (ii) provides for the donation to the United States of all lands acquired by the State within the preserve pursuant to the provision of “the Big Cypress Conservation Act of 1973” (Chapter 73–131 of the Florida Statutes) or provides for the donation to the United States of any remaining moneys appropriated pursuant to such Act for the purchase of lands within the preserve.

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the planned construction of Interstate 75 is presently being designed in such a way as to improve the natural water flow to the Everglades National Park, which has been disrupted by State Road 84 (commonly known as ‘Alligator Alley’);




“(2)
 the planned construction of Interstate 75 provides an opportunity to enhance protection of the Everglades National Park, to promote protection of the endangered Florida panther, and to provide for public recreational use and enjoyment of public lands by expanding the Big Cypress National Preserve to include those lands adjacent to Interstate 75 in Collier County north and east of the Big Cypress National Preserve, west of the Broward County line, and south of the Hendry County line;




“(3)
 the Federal acquisition of lands bordering the Big Cypress National Preserve in conjunction with the construction of Interstate 75 would provide significant public benefits by limiting development pressure on lands which are important both in terms of fish and wildlife habitat supporting endangered species and of wetlands which are the headwaters of the Big Cypress National Preserve; and




“(4)
 public ownership of lands adjacent to the Big Cypress National Preserve would enhance the protection of the Everglades National Park while providing recreational opportunities and other public uses currently offered by the Big Cypress National Preserve.




“(b)
 
Purpose
.—
It is the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note above] to establish the Big Cypress National Preserve Addition.”

 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
 the Baca ranch comprises most of the Valles Caldera in central New Mexico, and constitutes a unique land mass, with significant scientific, cultural, historic, recreational, ecological, wildlife, fisheries, and productive values;




(2)
 the Valles Caldera is a large resurgent lava dome with potential geothermal activity;




(3)
 the land comprising the Baca ranch was originally granted to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de Vaca in 1860;




(4)
 historical evidence, in the form of old logging camps and other artifacts, and the history of territorial New Mexico indicate the importance of this land over many generations for domesticated livestock production and timber supply;




(5)
 the careful husbandry of the Baca ranch by the current owners, including selective timbering, limited grazing and hunting, and the use of prescribed fire, have preserved a mix of healthy range and timber land with significant species diversity, thereby serving as a model for sustainable land development and use;




(6)
 the Baca ranch’s natural beauty and abundant resources, and its proximity to large municipal populations, could provide numerous recreational opportunities for hiking, fishing, camping, cross-country skiing, and hunting;




(7)
 the Forest Service documented the scenic and natural values of the Baca ranch in its 1993 study entitled “Report on the Study of the Baca Location No. 1, Santa Fe National Forest, New Mexico”, as directed by 
Public Law 101–556
;




(8)
 the Baca ranch can be protected for current and future generations by continued operation as a working ranch under a unique management regime which would protect the land and resource values of the property and surrounding ecosystem while allowing and providing for the ranch to eventually become financially self-sustaining;




(9)
 the current owners have indicated that they wish to sell the Baca ranch, creating an opportunity for Federal acquisition and public access and enjoyment of these lands;




(10)
 certain features on the Baca ranch have historical and religious significance to Native Americans which can be preserved and protected through Federal acquisition of the property;




(11)
 the unique nature of the Valles Caldera and the potential uses of its resources with different resulting impacts warrants a management regime uniquely capable of developing an operational program for appropriate preservation and development of the land and resources of the Baca ranch in the interest of the public;




(12)
 an experimental management regime should be provided by the establishment of a Trust capable of using new methods of public land management that may prove to be cost-effective and environmentally sensitive; and




(13)
 the Secretary may promote more efficient management of the Valles Caldera and the watershed of the Santa Clara Creek through the assignment of purchase rights of such watershed to the Pueblo of Santa Clara.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of sections 698v to 698v–10 of this title are—
(1)
 to authorize Federal acquisition of the Baca ranch;




(2)
 to protect and preserve for future generations the scientific, scenic, historic, and natural values of the Baca ranch, including rivers and ecosystems and archaeological, geological, and cultural resources;




(3)
 to provide opportunities for public recreation;




(4)
 to establish a demonstration area for an experimental management regime adapted to this unique property which incorporates elements of public and private administration in order to promote long term financial sustainability consistent with the other purposes enumerated in this subsection; and
