Chapter 45
URBAN PARK AND RECREATION RECOVERY PROGRAM
 Congressional findings
(a)
 the quality of life in urban areas is closely related to the availability of fully functional park and recreation systems including land, facilities, and service programs;


(b)
 residents of cities need close-to-home recreational opportunities that are adequate to specialized urban demands, with parks and facilities properly located, developed, and well maintained;


(c)
 the greatest recreational deficiencies with respect to land, facilities, and programs are found in many large cities, especially at the neighborhood level;


(d)
 inadequate financing of urban recreation programs due to fiscal difficulties in many large cities has led to the deterioration of facilities, nonavailability of recreation services, and an inability to adapt recreational programs to changing circumstances; and


(e)
 there is no existing Federal assistance program which fully addresses the needs for physical rehabilitation and revitalization of these park and recreation systems.


 Congressional statement of purpose; complementary program authorization; terms and conditions
The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the Secretary to establish an urban park and recreation recovery program which would provide Federal grants to economically hard-pressed communities specifically for the rehabilitation of critically needed recreation areas, facilities, and development of improved recreation programs. This program is intended to complement existing Federal programs such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund and Community Development Grant Programs by encouraging and stimulating local governments to revitalize their park and recreation systems and to make long-term commitments to continuing maintenance of these systems. Such assistance shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers appropriate and in the public interest to carry out the purposes of this chapter. It is further the purpose of this chapter to improve recreation facilities and expand recreation services in urban areas with a high incidence of crime and to help deter crime through the expansion of recreation opportunities for at-risk youth. It is the further purpose of this section

(b)
 Special considerations
Innovation grants should be closely tied to goals, priorities, and implementation strategies expressed in local park and recreation recovery action programs, with particular regard to the special considerations listed in 
section 2506(b)(2) of this title
.




 Local commitments to system recovery and maintenance
(a)
 Recovery action programs; preliminary action programs; five-year recovery action programs; continuing planning process
As a requirement for project approval, local governments applying for assistance under this chapter shall submit to the Secretary evidence of their commitments to ongoing planning, rehabilitation, service, operation, and maintenance programs for their park and recreation systems. These commitments will be expressed in local park and recreation recovery action programs which maximize coordination of all community resources, including other federally supported urban development and recreation programs. During an initial interim period to be established by regulations under this chapter, this requirement may be satisfied by local government submissions of preliminary action programs which briefly define objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies for overall system recovery and maintenance and commit the applicant to a scheduled program development process. Following this interim period, all local applicants shall submit to the Secretary, as a condition of eligibility, a five-year action program for park and recreation recovery that satisfactorily demonstrate: 
1
1
 So in original. Probably should be “demonstrates:”.
(1)
 systematic identification of recovery objectives, priorities, and implementation strategies;




(2)
 adequate planning for rehabilitation of specific recreation areas and facilities, including projections of the cost of proposed projects;




(3)
 capacity and commitment to assure that facilities provided or improved under this chapter shall thereafter continue to be adequately maintained, protected, staffed, and supervised;




(4)
 intention to maintain total local public outlays for park and recreation purposes at levels at least equal to those in the year preceding that in which grant assistance is sought beginning in fiscal year 1980 except in any case where a reduction in park and recreation outlays is proportionate to a reduction in overall spending by the applicant; and




(5)
 the relationship of the park and recreation recovery program to overall community development and urban revitalization efforts.





Where appropriate, the Secretary may encourage local governments to meet action program requirements through a continuing planning process which includes periodic improvements and updates in action program submissions to eliminate identified gaps in program information and policy development.


(b)
 Recovery action program special considerations
Action programs shall address, but are not limited to the following considerations:
(1)
 Rehabilitation of existing recreational sites and facilities, including general systemwide renovation; special rehabilitation requirements for recreational sites and facilities in areas of high population concentration and economic distress; and restoration of outstanding or unique structures, landscaping, or similar  features  in  parks  of  historical  or architectural significance.




(2)
 Local commitments to innovative and cost-effective programs and projects at the neighborhood level to augment recovery of park and recreation systems, including but not limited to recycling of abandoned schools and other public buildings for recreational purposes; multiple use of operating educational and other public buildings; purchase of recreation services on a contractual basis; use of mobile facilities and recreational, cultural, and educational programs or other innovative approaches to improving access for neighborhood residents; integration of recovery program with federally assisted projects to maximize recreational opportunities through conversion of abandoned railroad and highway rights-of-way, waterfront, and other redevelopment efforts and such other federally assisted projects as may be appropriate; conversion of recreation use of street space, derelict land, and other public lands not now designated for neighborhood recreational use; and use of various forms of compensated and uncompensated land regulation, tax inducements, or other means to encourage the private sector to provide neighborhood park and recreation facilities and programs.





The Secretary shall establish and publish in the Federal Register requirements for preparation, submission, and updating of local park and recreation recovery action programs. In order to be eligible to receive “at-risk youth recreation grants” a local government shall amend its 5-year action program to incorporate the goal of reducing crime and juvenile delinquency and to provide a description of the implementation strategies to achieve this goal. The plan shall also address how the local government is coordinating its recreation programs with crime prevention efforts of law enforcement, juvenile corrections, and youth social service agencies.


(c)
 Recovery action program grants
The Secretary is authorized to provide up to 50 per centum matching grants to eligible local applicants for program development and planning specifically to meet the objectives of this chapter.




 State action incentive; Federal implementation grants, increase
The Secretary is authorized to increase Federal implementation grants authorized in 
 Matching requirements; non-Federal share of project costs
The non-Federal share of project costs assisted under this chapter may be derived from general or special purpose State or local revenues.
 Conversion of recreation property
No property improved or developed with assistance under this chapter shall, without the approval of the Secretary, be converted to other than public recreation uses. The Secretary shall approve such conversion only if he finds it to be in accord with the current local park and recreation recovery action program and only upon such conditions as he deems necessary to assure the provision of adequate recreation properties and opportunities of reasonably equivalent location and usefulness.
 Coordination of program
The Secretary shall (a) coordinate the urban park and recreation recovery program with the total urban recovery effort and cooperate to the fullest extent possible with other Federal departments and agencies and with State agencies which administer programs and policies affecting urban areas, including but not limited to, programs in housing, urban development, natural resources management, employment, transportation, community services, and voluntary action; (b) encourage maximum coordination of the program between appropriate State agencies and local applicants; and (c) require that local applicants include provisions for participation of community and neighborhood residents and for public-private coordination in recovery planning and project selection.
