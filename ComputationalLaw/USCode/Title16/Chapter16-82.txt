Chapter 82
GREAT APE CONSERVATION
 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
 great ape populations have declined to the point that the long-term survival of the species in the wild is in serious jeopardy;




(2)
 the chimpanzee, gorilla, bonobo, orangutan, and gibbon are listed as endangered species under 
section 1533 of this title
 and under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249);




(3)
 because the challenges facing the conservation of great apes are so immense, the resources available to date have not been sufficient to cope with the continued loss of habitat due to human encroachment and logging and the consequent diminution of great ape populations;




(4)
 because great apes are flagship species for the conservation of the tropical forest habitats in which they are found, conservation of great apes provides benefits to numerous other species of wildlife, including many other endangered species;




(5)
 among the threats to great apes, in addition to habitat loss, are population fragmentation, hunting for the bushmeat trade, live capture, and exposure to emerging or introduced diseases;




(6)
 great apes are important components of the ecosystems they inhabit, and studies of their wild populations have provided important biological insights;




(7)
 although subsistence hunting of tropical forest animals has occurred for hundreds of years at a sustainable level, the tremendous increase in the commercial trade of tropical forest species is detrimental to the future of these species; and




(8)
 the reduction, removal, or other effective addressing of the threats to the long-term viability of populations of great apes in the wild will require the joint commitment and effort of countries that have within their boundaries any part of the range of great apes, the United States and other countries, and the private sector.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are—
(1)
 to sustain viable populations of great apes in the wild; and




(2)
 to assist in the conservation and protection of great apes by supporting conservation programs of countries in which populations of great apes are located and by supporting the CITES Secretariat.




 Definitions

 Project review and approval
(1)
 In general
The Secretary shall—
(A)
 not later than 30 days after receiving a project proposal, provide a copy of the proposal to other appropriate Federal officials; and




(B)
 review each project proposal in a timely manner to determine if the proposal meets the criteria specified in subsection (d) of this section.






(2)
 Consultation; approval or disapproval
Not later than 180 days after receiving a project proposal, and subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary, after consulting with other appropriate Federal officials, shall—

 consult on the proposal with the government of each country in which the project is to be conducted;




(B)
 after taking into consideration any comments resulting from the consultation, approve or disapprove the proposal; and




(C)
 provide written notification of the approval or disapproval to the person who submitted the proposal, other appropriate Federal officials, and each country described in subparagraph (A).






(d)
 Criteria for approval
The Secretary may approve a project proposal under this section if the project will enhance programs for conservation of great apes by assisting efforts to—
(1)
 implement conservation programs;




(2)
 address the conflicts between humans and great apes that arise from competition for the same habitat;




(3)
 enhance compliance with CITES and other applicable laws that prohibit or regulate the taking or trade of great apes or regulate the use and management of great ape habitat;
