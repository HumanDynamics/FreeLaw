(4)
 Federal land on which windthrow or blowdown, ice storm damage, the existence of an epidemic of disease or insects, or the presence of such an epidemic on immediately adjacent land and the imminent risk it will spread, poses a significant threat to an ecosystem component, or forest or rangeland resource, on the Federal land or adjacent non-Federal land; and




(5)
 Federal land not covered by paragraphs (1) through (4) that contains threatened and endangered species habitat, if—
(A)
 natural fire regimes on that land are identified as being important for, or wildfire is identified as a threat to, an endangered species, a threatened species, or habitat of an endangered species or threatened species in a species recovery plan prepared under 
section 1533 of this title
, or a notice published in the Federal Register determining a species to be an endangered species or a threatened species or designating critical habitat;

 Administrative review
(1)
 In general

 the administrative review process established by the Secretary of Agriculture under this section; or




(B)
 the administrative hearings and appeals procedures established by the Department of the Interior.






(2)
 Issues

 Authorization of appropriations
 Biomass commercial utilization grant program
(a)
 In general
In addition to any other authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants to a person that owns or operates a facility that uses biomass as a raw material to produce electric energy, sensible heat, transportation fuel, or substitutes for petroleum-based products, the Secretary may make grants to a person that owns or operates a facility that uses biomass for wood-based products or other commercial purposes to offset the costs incurred to purchase biomass.




(b)
 Authorization of appropriations
There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2008.




 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
 there has been a dramatic shift in public attitudes and perceptions about forest management, particularly in the understanding and practice of sustainable forest management;




(2)
 it is commonly recognized that the proper stewardship of forest land is essential to sustaining and restoring the health of watersheds;




(3)
 forests can provide essential ecological services in filtering pollutants, buffering important rivers and estuaries, and minimizing flooding, which makes forest restoration worthy of special focus; and




(4)
 strengthened education, technical assistance, and financial assistance for nonindustrial private forest landowners and communities, relating to the protection of watershed health, is needed to realize the expectations of the general public.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this subchapter are—
(1)
 to improve landowner and public understanding of the connection between forest management and watershed health;




(2)
 to encourage landowners to maintain tree cover on property and to use tree plantings and vegetative treatments as creative solutions to watershed problems associated with varying land uses;




(3)
 to enhance and complement forest management and buffer use for watersheds, with an emphasis on community watersheds;




(4)
 to establish new partnerships and collaborative watershed approaches to forest management, stewardship, and conservation;




(5)
 to provide technical and financial assistance to States to deliver a coordinated program that enhances State forestry best-management practices programs, and conserves and improves forested land and potentially forested land, through technical, financial, and educational assistance to qualifying individuals and entities; and




(6)
 to maximize the proper management and conservation of wetland forests and to assist in the restoration of those forests.




 Repealed. 
 Findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds that—
(1)
 high levels of tree mortality resulting from insect infestation (including the interaction between insects and diseases) may result in—
(A)
 increased fire risk;




(B)
 loss of old trees and old growth;




(C)
 loss of threatened and endangered species;




(D)
 loss of species diversity;




(E)
 degraded watershed conditions;




(F)
 increased potential for damage from other agents of disturbance, including exotic, invasive species; and




(G)
 decreased timber values;






(2)
(A)
 forest-damaging insects destroy hundreds of thousands of acres of trees each year;




(B)
 in the West, more than 21,000,000 acres are at high risk of forest-damaging insect infestation, and in the South, more than 57,000,000 acres are at risk across all land ownerships; and




(C)
 severe drought conditions in many areas of the South and West will increase the risk of forest-damaging insect infestations;






(3)
 the hemlock woolly adelgid is—
(A)
 destroying streamside forests throughout the mid-Atlantic and Appalachian regions;




(B)
 threatening water quality and sensitive aquatic species; and




(C)
 posing a potential threat to valuable commercial timber land in northern New England;






(4)
(A)
 the emerald ash borer is a nonnative, invasive pest that has quickly become a major threat to hardwood forests because an emerald ash borer infestation is almost always fatal to affected trees; and




(B)
 the emerald ash borer pest threatens to destroy more than 692,000,000 ash trees in forests in Michigan and Ohio alone, and between 5 and 10 percent of urban street trees in the Upper Midwest;






(5)
(A)
 epidemic populations of Southern pine beetles are ravaging forests in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia; and




(B)
 in 2001, Florida and Kentucky experienced 146 percent and 111 percent increases, respectively, in Southern pine beetle populations;






(6)
 those epidemic outbreaks of Southern pine beetles have forced private landowners to harvest dead and dying trees, in rural areas and increasingly urbanized settings;




(7)
 according to the Forest Service, recent outbreaks of the red oak borer in Arkansas and Missouri have been unprecedented, with more than 1,000,000 acres infested at population levels never seen before;




(8)
 much of the damage from the red oak borer has taken place in national forests, and the Federal response has been inadequate to protect forest ecosystems and other ecological and economic resources;




(9)
(A)
 previous silvicultural assessments, while useful and informative, have been limited in scale and scope of application; and




(B)
 there have not been sufficient resources available to adequately test a full array of individual and combined applied silvicultural assessments;






(10)
 only through the full funding, development, and assessment of potential applied silvicultural assessments over specific time frames across an array of environmental and climatic conditions can the most innovative and cost effective management applications be determined that will help reduce the susceptibility of forest ecosystems to attack by forest pests;




(11)
(A)
 often, there are significant interactions between insects and diseases;




(B)
 many diseases (such as white pine blister rust, beech bark disease, and many other diseases) can weaken trees and forest stands and predispose trees and forest stands to insect attack; and




(C)
 certain diseases are spread using insects as vectors (including Dutch elm disease and pine pitch canker); and






(12)
 funding and implementation of an initiative to combat forest pest infestations and associated diseases should not come at the expense of supporting other programs and initiatives of the Secretary.




(b)
 Purposes
The purposes of this subchapter are—
(1)
 to require the Secretary to develop an accelerated basic and applied assessment program to combat infestations by forest-damaging insects and associated diseases;




(2)
 to enlist the assistance of colleges and universities (including forestry schools, land grant colleges and universities, and 1890 Institutions), State agencies, and private landowners to carry out the program; and




(3)
 to carry out applied silvicultural assessments.

(B)
 effects of infestations and associated disease interactions on forest ecosystems;




(C)
 restoration of forest ecosystem efforts;




(D)
 utilization options regarding infested trees; and




(E)
