Chapter 38
FISHERY CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT
 Findings, purposes and policy
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds and declares the following:
(1)
 The fish off the coasts of the United States, the highly migratory species of the high seas, the species which dwell on or in the Continental Shelf appertaining to the United States, and the anadromous species which spawn in United States rivers or estuaries, constitute valuable and renewable natural resources. These fishery resources contribute to the food supply, economy, and health of the Nation and provide recreational opportunities.




(2)
 Certain stocks of fish have declined to the point where their survival is threatened, and other stocks of fish have been so substantially reduced in number that they could become similarly threatened as a consequence of (A) increased fishing pressure, (B) the inadequacy of fishery resource conservation and management practices and controls, or (C) direct and indirect habitat losses which have resulted in a diminished capacity to support existing fishing levels.




(3)
 Commercial and recreational fishing constitutes a major source of employment and contributes significantly to the economy of the Nation. Many coastal areas are dependent upon fishing and related activities, and their economies have been badly damaged by the overfishing of fishery resources at an ever-increasing rate over the past decade. The activities of massive foreign fishing fleets in waters adjacent to such coastal areas have contributed to such damage, interfered with domestic fishing efforts, and caused destruction of the fishing gear of United States fishermen.




(4)
 International fishery agreements have not been effective in preventing or terminating the overfishing of these valuable fishery resources. There is danger that irreversible effects from overfishing will take place before an effective international agreement on fishery management jurisdiction can be negotiated, signed, ratified, and implemented.




(5)
 Fishery resources are finite but renewable. If placed under sound management before overfishing has caused irreversible effects, the fisheries can be conserved and maintained so as to provide optimum yields on a continuing basis.




(6)
 A national program for the conservation and management of the fishery resources of the United States is necessary to prevent overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, to insure conservation, to facilitate long-term protection of essential fish habitats, and to realize the full potential of the Nation’s fishery resources.




(7)
 A national program for the development of fisheries which are underutilized or not utilized by the United States fishing industry, including bottom fish off Alaska, is necessary to assure that our citizens benefit from the employment, food supply, and revenue which could be generated thereby.




(8)
 The collection of reliable data is essential to the effective conservation, management, and scientific understanding of the fishery resources of the United States.




(9)
 One of the greatest long-term threats to the viability of commercial and recreational fisheries is the continuing loss of marine, estuarine, and other aquatic habitats. Habitat considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery resources of the United States.




(10)
 Pacific Insular Areas contain unique historical, cultural, legal, political, and geographical circumstances which make fisheries resources important in sustaining their economic growth.




(11)
 A number of the Fishery Management Councils have demonstrated significant progress in integrating ecosystem considerations in fisheries management using the existing authorities provided under this chapter.




(12)
 International cooperation is necessary to address illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing and other fishing practices which may harm the sustainability of living marine resources and disadvantage the United States fishing industry.




(b)
 Purposes
It is therefore declared to be the purposes of the Congress in this chapter—
(1)
 to take immediate action to conserve and manage the fishery resources found off the coasts of the United States, and the anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources of the United States, by exercising (A) sovereign rights for the purposes of exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing all fish, within the exclusive economic zone established by Presidential Proclamation 5030, dated 
March 10, 1983
, and (B) exclusive fishery management authority beyond the exclusive economic zone over such anadromous species and Continental Shelf fishery resources;




(2)
 to support and encourage the implementation and enforcement of international fishery agreements for the conservation and management of highly migratory species, and to encourage the negotiation and implementation of additional such agreements as necessary;




(3)
 to promote domestic commercial and recreational fishing under sound conservation and management principles, including the promotion of catch and release programs in recreational fishing;




(4)
 to provide for the preparation and implementation, in accordance with national standards, of fishery management plans which will achieve and maintain, on a continuing basis, the optimum yield from each fishery;




(5)
 to establish Regional Fishery Management Councils to exercise sound judgment in the stewardship of fishery resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revision of such plans under circumstances (A) which will enable the States, the fishing industry, consumer and environmental organizations, and other interested persons to participate in, and advise on, the establishment and administration of such plans, and (B) which take into account the social and economic needs of the States;




(6)
 to encourage the development by the United States fishing industry of fisheries which are currently underutilized or not utilized by United States fishermen, including bottom fish off Alaska, and to that end, to ensure that optimum yield determinations promote such development in a non-wasteful manner; and




(7)
 to promote the protection of essential fish habitat in the review of projects conducted under Federal permits, licenses, or other authorities that affect or have the potential to affect such habitat.




(c)
 Policy
It is further declared to be the policy of the Congress in this chapter—
(1)
 to maintain without change the existing territorial or other ocean jurisdiction of the United States for all purposes other than the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;




(2)
 to authorize no impediment to, or interference with, recognized legitimate uses of the high seas, except as necessary for the conservation and management of fishery resources, as provided for in this chapter;




(3)
 to assure that the national fishery conservation and management program utilizes, and is based upon, the best scientific information available; involves, and is responsive to the needs of, interested and affected States and citizens; considers efficiency; draws upon Federal, State, and academic capabilities in carrying out research, administration, management, and enforcement; considers the effects of fishing on immature fish and encourages development of practical measures that minimize bycatch and avoid unnecessary waste of fish; and is workable and effective;




(4)
 to permit foreign fishing consistent with the provisions of this chapter;




(5)
 to support and encourage active United States efforts to obtain internationally acceptable agreements which provide for effective conservation and management of fishery resources, and to secure agreements to regulate fishing by vessels or persons beyond the exclusive economic zones of any nation;




(6)
 to foster and maintain the diversity of fisheries in the United States; and




(7)
 to ensure that the fishery resources adjacent to a Pacific Insular Area, including resident or migratory stocks within the exclusive economic zone adjacent to such areas, be explored, developed, conserved, and managed for the benefit of the people of such area and of the United States.

 Omitted
 Foreign fishing
(a)
 In general
After 
February 28, 1977
, no foreign fishing is authorized within the exclusive economic zone, or for anadromous species or Continental Shelf fishery resources beyond the exclusive economic zone, unless such foreign fishing—
(1)
 is authorized under subsections (b) or (c) of this section or 
section 1824(e) of this title
, or under a permit issued under 
section 1824(d) of this title
;




(2)
 is not prohibited under subsection (f) of this section; and




(3)
 is conducted under, and in accordance with, a valid and applicable permit issued pursuant to 
section 1824 of this title
.




(b)
 Existing international fishery agreements
Foreign fishing described in subsection (a) of this section may be conducted pursuant to an international fishery agreement (subject to the provisions of section 1822(b) or (c) of this title), if such agreement—
(1)
 was in effect on 
April 13, 1976
; and




(2)
 has not expired, been renegotiated, or otherwise ceased to be of force and effect with respect to the United States.




(c)
 Governing international fishery agreements
Foreign fishing described in subsection (a) of this section may be conducted pursuant to an international fishery agreement (other than a treaty) which meets the requirements of this subsection if such agreement becomes effective after application of 
section 1823 of this title
. Any such international fishery agreement shall hereafter in this chapter be referred to as a “governing international fishery agreement”. Each governing international fishery agreement shall acknowledge the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, as set forth in this chapter. It is the sense of the Congress that each such agreement shall include a binding commitment, on the part of such foreign nation and its fishing vessels, to comply with the following terms and conditions:
(1)
 The foreign nation, and the owner or operator of any fishing vessel fishing pursuant to such agreement, will abide by all regulations promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter, including any regulations promulgated to implement any applicable fishery management plan or any preliminary fishery management plan.




(2)
 The foreign nation, and the owner or operator of any fishing vessel fishing pursuant to such agreement, will abide by the requirement that—
(A)
 any officer authorized to enforce the provisions of this chapter (as provided for in 
section 1861 of this title
) be permitted—
(i)
 to board, and search or inspect, any such vessel at any time,




(ii)
 to make arrests and seizures provided for in 
section 1861(b) of this title
 whenever such officer has reasonable cause to believe, as a result of such a search or inspection, that any such vessel or any person has committed an act prohibited by 
section 1857 of this title
, and




(iii)
 to examine and make notations on the permit issued pursuant to 
section 1824 of this title
 for such vessel;






(B)
 the permit issued for any such vessel pursuant to 
section 1824 of this title
 be prominently displayed in the wheelhouse of such vessel;




(C)
 transponders, or such other appropriate position-fixing and identification equipment as the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating determines to be appropriate, be installed and maintained in working order on each such vessel;




(D)
 United States observers required under subsection (h) of this section be permitted to be stationed aboard any such vessel and that all of the costs incurred incident to such stationing, including the costs of data editing and entry and observer monitoring, be paid for, in accordance with such subsection, by the owner or operator of the vessel;




(E)
 any fees required under 
section 1824(b)(10) of this title
 be paid in advance;




(F)
 agents be appointed and maintained within the United States who are authorized to receive and respond to any legal process issued in the United States with respect to such owner or operator; and




(G)
 responsibility be assumed, in accordance with any requirements prescribed by the Secretary, for the reimbursement of United States citizens for any loss of, or damage to, their fishing vessels, fishing gear, or catch which is caused by any fishing vessel of that nation;





and will abide by any other monitoring, compliance, or enforcement requirement related to fishery conservation and management which is included in such agreement.




(3)
 The foreign nation and the owners or operators of all of the fishing vessels of such nation shall not, in any year, harvest an amount of fish which exceeds such nation’s allocation of the total allowable level of foreign fishing, as determined under subsection (e) of this section.




(4)
 The foreign nation will—
(A)
 apply, pursuant to 
section 1824 of this title
, for any required permits;




(B)
 deliver promptly to the owner or operator of the appropriate fishing vessel any permit which is issued under that section for such vessel;




(C)
 abide by, and take appropriate steps under its own laws to assure that all such owners and operators comply with, 
section 1824(a) of this title
 and the applicable conditions and restrictions established under 
section 1824(b)(7) of this title
; and




(D)
 take, or refrain from taking, as appropriate, actions of the kind referred to in subsection (e)(1) of this section in order to receive favorable allocations under such subsection.






(d)
 Total allowable level of foreign fishing
The total allowable level of foreign fishing, if any, with respect to any fishery subject to the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States, is that portion of the optimum yield of such fishery which cannot, or will not, be harvested by vessels of the United States, as determined in accordance with this chapter. Allocations of the total allowable level of foreign fishing are discretionary, except that the total allowable level shall be zero for fisheries determined by the Secretary to have adequate or excess domestic harvest capacity.




(e)
 Allocation of allowable level
(1)
(A)
 The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, may make allocations to foreign nations from the total allowable level of foreign fishing which is permitted with respect to each fishery subject to the exclusive fishery management authority of the United States.




(B)
 From the determinations made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of State shall compute the aggregate of all of the fishery allocations made to each foreign nation.




(C)
 The Secretary of State shall initially release to each foreign nation for harvesting up to 50 percent of the allocations aggregate computed for such nation under subparagraph (B), and such release of allocation shall be apportioned by the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, among the individual fishery allocations determined for that nation under subparagraph (A). The basis on which each apportionment is made under this subparagraph shall be stated in writing by the Secretary of State.




(D)
 After the initial release of fishery allocations under subparagraph (C) to a foreign nation, any subsequent release of an allocation for any fishery to such nation shall only be made—
(i)
 after the lapse of such period of time as may be sufficient for purposes of making the determination required under clause (ii); and




(ii)
 if the Secretary of State and the Secretary, after taking into account the size of the allocation for such fishery and the length and timing of the fishing season, determine in writing that such nation is complying with the purposes and intent of this paragraph with respect to such fishery.





If the foreign nation is not determined under clause (ii) to be in such compliance, the Secretary of State shall reduce, in a manner and quantity he considers to be appropriate (I) the remainder of such allocation, or (II) if all of such allocation has been released, the next allocation of such fishery, if any, made to such nation.




(E)
 The determinations required to be made under subparagraphs (A) and (D)(ii), and the apportionments required to be made under subparagraph (C), with respect to a foreign nation shall be based on—
(i)
 whether, and to what extent, such nation imposes tariff barriers or nontariff barriers on the importation, or otherwise restricts the market access, of both United States fish and fishery products, particularly fish and fishery products for which the foreign nation has requested an allocation;




(ii)
 whether, and to what extent, such nation is cooperating with the United States in both the advancement of existing and new opportunities for fisheries exports from the United States through the purchase of fishery products from United States processors, and the advancement of fisheries trade through the purchase of fish and fishery products from United States fishermen, particularly fish and fishery products for which the foreign nation has requested an allocation;




(iii)
 whether, and to what extent, such nation and the fishing fleets of such nation have cooperated with the United States in the enforcement of United States fishing regulations;




(iv)
 whether, and to what extent, such nation requires the fish harvested from the exclusive economic zone for its domestic consumption;




(v)
 whether, and to what extent, such nation otherwise contributes to, or fosters the growth of, a sound and economic United States fishing industry, including minimizing gear conflicts with fishing operations of United States fishermen, and transferring harvesting or processing technology which will benefit the United States fishing industry;




(vi)
 whether, and to what extent, the fishing vessels of such nation have traditionally engaged in fishing in such fishery;




(vii)
 whether, and to what extent, such nation is cooperating with the United States in, and making substantial contributions to, fishery research and the identification of fishery resources; and




(viii)
 such other matters as the Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, deems appropriate.








(2)
(A)
 For the purposes of this paragraph—
(i)
 The term “certification” means a certification made by the Secretary that nationals of a foreign country, directly or indirectly, are conducting fishing operations or engaging in trade or taking which diminishes the effectiveness of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. A certification under this section shall also be deemed a certification for the purposes of 
section 1978(a) of title 22
.




(ii)
 The term “remedial period” means the 365-day period beginning on the date on which a certification is issued with respect to a foreign country.






(B)
 If the Secretary issues a certification with respect to any foreign country, then each allocation under paragraph (1) that—
(i)
 is in effect for that foreign country on the date of issuance; or




(ii)
 is not in effect on such date but would, without regard to this paragraph, be made to the foreign country within the remedial period;





shall be reduced by the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, by not less than 50 percent.




(C)
 The following apply for purposes of administering subparagraph (B) with respect to any foreign country:
(i)
 If on the date of certification, the foreign country has harvested a portion, but not all, of the quantity of fish specified under any allocation, the reduction under subparagraph (B) for that allocation shall be applied with respect to the quantity not harvested as of such date.




(ii)
 If the Secretary notified the Secretary of State that it is not likely that the certification of the foreign country will be terminated under 
section 1978(d) of title 22
 before the close of the period for which an allocation is applicable or before the close of the remedial period (whichever close first occurs) the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary, shall reallocate any portion of any reduction made under subparagraph (B) among one or more foreign countries for which no certification is in effect.




(iii)
 If the certification is terminated under such 
section 1978(d) of title 22
 during the remedial period, the Secretary of State shall return to the foreign country that portion of any allocation reduced under subparagraph (B) that was not reallocated under clause (ii); unless the harvesting of the fish covered by the allocation is otherwise prohibited under this chapter.




(iv)
 The Secretary may refund or credit, by reason of reduction of any allocation under this paragraph, any fee paid under 
section 1824 of this title
.






(D)
 If the certification of a foreign country is not terminated under 
section 1978(d) of title 22
 before the close of the last day of the remedial period, the Secretary of State—
(i)
 with respect to any allocation made to that country and in effect (as reduced under subparagraph (B)) on such last day, shall rescind, effective on and after the day after such last day, any unharvested portion of such allocation; and




(ii)
 may not thereafter make any allocation to that country under paragraph (1) until the certification is terminated.








(f)
 Reciprocity
Foreign fishing shall not be authorized for the fishing vessels of any foreign nation unless such nation satisfies the Secretary and the Secretary of State that such nation extends substantially the same fishing privileges to fishing vessels of the United States, if any, as the United States extends to foreign fishing vessels.




(g)
 Preliminary fishery management plans
The Secretary, when notified by the Secretary of State that any foreign nation has submitted an application under 
section 1824(b) of this title
 shall prepare a preliminary fishery management plan for any fishery covered by such application if the Secretary determines that no fishery management plan for that fishery will be prepared and implemented, pursuant to subchapter IV of this chapter, before 
March 1, 1977
. To the extent practicable, each such plan—
(1)
 shall contain a preliminary description of the fishery and a preliminary determination as to—
(A)
 the optimum yield from such fishery;




(B)
 when appropriate, the capacity and extent to which United States fish processors will process that portion of such optimum yield that will be harvested by vessels of the United States; and




(C)
 the total allowable level of foreign fishing with respect to such fishery;






(2)
 shall require each foreign fishing vessel engaged or wishing to engage in such fishery to obtain a permit from the Secretary;




(3)
 shall require the submission of pertinent data to the Secretary, with respect to such fishery, as described in 
section 1853(a)(5) of this title
; and




(4)
 may, to the extent necessary to prevent irreversible effects from overfishing, with respect to such fishery, contain conservation and management measures applicable to foreign fishing which—
(A)
 are determined to be necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of such fishery,




(B)
 are consistent with the national standards, the other provisions of this chapter, and other applicable law, and




(C)
 are described in section 1853(b)(2), (3), (4), (5), and (7) of this title.







Each preliminary fishery management plan shall be in effect with respect to foreign fishing for which permits have been issued until a fishery management plan is prepared and implemented, pursuant to subchapter IV of this chapter, with respect to such fishery. The Secretary may, in accordance with 
section 553 of title 5
, also prepare and promulgate interim regulations with respect to any such preliminary plan. Such regulations shall be in effect until regulations implementing the applicable fishery management plan are promulgated pursuant to 
section 1855 of this title
.


(h)
 Full observer coverage program
(1)
(A)
 Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall establish a program under which a United States observer will be stationed aboard each foreign fishing vessel while that vessel is engaged in fishing within the exclusive economic zone.




(B)
 The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe minimum health and safety standards that shall be maintained aboard each foreign fishing vessel with regard to the facilities provided for the quartering of, and the carrying out of observer functions by, United States observers.






(2)
 The requirement in paragraph (1) that a United States observer be placed aboard each foreign fishing vessel may be waived by the Secretary if he finds that—
(A)
 in a situation where a fleet of harvesting vessels transfers its catch taken within the exclusive economic zone to another vessel, aboard which is a United States observer, the stationing of United States observers on only a portion of the harvesting vessel fleet will provide a representative sampling of the by-catch of the fleet that is sufficient for purposes of determining whether the requirements of the applicable management plans for the by-catch species are being complied with;




(B)
 in a situation where the foreign fishing vessel is operating under a Pacific Insular Area fishing agreement, the Governor of the applicable Pacific Insular Area, in consultation with the Western Pacific Council, has established an observer coverage program or other monitoring program that the Secretary, in consultation with the Western Pacific Management Council, determines is adequate to monitor harvest, bycatch, and compliance with the laws of the United States by vessels fishing under the agreement;




(C)
 the time during which a foreign fishing vessel will engage in fishing within the exclusive economic zone will be of such short duration that the placing of a United States observer aboard the vessel would be impractical; or




(D)
 for reasons beyond the control of the Secretary, an observer is not available.






(3)
 Observers, while stationed aboard foreign fishing vessels, shall carry out such scientific, compliance monitoring, and other functions as the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter; and shall cooperate in carrying out such other scientific programs relating to the conservation and management of living resources as the Secretary deems appropriate.




(4)
 In addition to any fee imposed under 
section 1824(b)(10) of this title
 and 
section 1980(e) of title 22
 with respect to foreign fishing for any year after 1980, the Secretary shall impose, with respect to each foreign fishing vessel for which a permit is issued under such 
section 1824 of this title
, a surcharge in an amount sufficient to cover all the costs of providing a United States observer aboard that vessel. The failure to pay any surcharge imposed under this paragraph shall be treated by the Secretary as a failure to pay the permit fee for such vessel under 
section 1824(b)(10) of this title
. All surcharges collected by the Secretary under this paragraph shall be deposited in the Foreign Fishing Observer Fund established by paragraph (5).




(5)
 There is established in the Treasury of the United States the Foreign Fishing Observer Fund. The Fund shall be available to the Secretary as a revolving fund for the purpose of carrying out this subsection. The Fund shall consist of the surcharges deposited into it as required under paragraph (4). All payments made by the Secretary to carry out this subsection shall be paid from the Fund, only to the extent and in the amounts provided for in advance in appropriation Acts. Sums in the Fund which are not currently needed for the purposes of this subsection shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.




(6)
 If at any time the requirement set forth in paragraph (1) cannot be met because of insufficient appropriations, the Secretary shall, in implementing a supplementary observer program:
(A)
 certify as observers, for the purposes of this subsection, individuals who are citizens or nationals of the United States and who have the requisite education or experience to carry out the functions referred to in paragraph (3);




(B)
 establish standards of conduct for certified observers equivalent to those applicable to Federal personnel;




(C)
 establish a reasonable schedule of fees that certified observers or their agents shall be paid by the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels for observer services; and




(D)
 monitor the performance of observers to ensure that it meets the purposes of this chapter.






(i)
 Recreational fishing
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, foreign fishing vessels which are not operated for profit may engage in recreational fishing within the exclusive economic zone and the waters within the boundaries of a State subject to obtaining such permits, paying such reasonable fees, and complying with such conditions and restrictions as the Secretary and the Governor of the State (or his designee) shall impose as being necessary or appropriate to insure that the fishing activity of such foreign vessels within such zone or waters, respectively, is consistent with all applicable Federal and State laws and any applicable fishery management plan implemented under 
section 1854 of this title
. The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating in formulating the conditions and restrictions to be applied by the Secretary under the authority of this subsection.




“(a)
 
In General
.—
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 201, 204, or 307(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (
16 U.S.C. 1821
, 1824, and 1857(2)), foreign fishing may be conducted pursuant to the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Canada on Pacific Coast Albacore Tuna Vessels and Port Privileges, signed at Washington 
May 26, 1981
, including its Annexes and any amendments thereto.


“(b)
 
Regulations
.—
The Secretary of Commerce, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State, may—
“(1)
 promulgate regulations necessary to discharge the obligations of the United States under the Treaty and its Annexes; and




“(2)
 provide for the application of any such regulation to any person or vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, wherever that person or vessel may be located.




“(c)
 Enforcement.—
“(1)
 
In general
.—
The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (
16 U.S.C. 1801
 et seq.) shall be enforced as if subsection (a) were a provision of that Act. Any reference in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (
16 U.S.C. 1801
 et seq.) to ‘this Act’ or to any provision of that Act, shall be considered to be a reference to that Act as it would be in effect if subsection (a) were a provision of that Act.




“(2)
 
Regulations
.—
The regulations promulgated under subsection (b), shall be enforced as if—
“(A)
 subsection (a) were a provision of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (
16 U.S.C. 1801
 et seq.); and




“(B)
 the regulations were promulgated under that Act.”






“(a)
 The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, as appropriate, shall exercise their authority under section 201(c)(2)(C) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (
16 U.S.C. 1821
) to require the use of transponders or other such appropriate position-fixing and identification equipment on any vessel other than a vessel of the United States engaged in fishing in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone.


“(b)
 The Secretary of Commerce, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall report to the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation of the Senate within 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act [
Nov. 7, 1988
] on the results of their compliance with subsection (a).”


 International fishery agreements
(a)
 Negotiations
The Secretary of State—
(1)
 shall renegotiate treaties as provided for in subsection (b) of this section;




(2)
 shall negotiate governing international fishery agreements described in 
section 1821(c) of this title
;




(3)
 may negotiate boundary agreements as provided for in subsection (d) of this section;




(4)
 shall, upon the request of and in cooperation with the Secretary, initiate and conduct negotiations for the purpose of entering into international fishery agreements—
(A)
 which allow fishing vessels of the United States equitable access to fish over which foreign nations assert exclusive fishery management authority, and




(B)
 which provide for the conservation and management of anadromous species and highly migratory species; and






(5)
 may enter into such other negotiations, not prohibited by subsection (c) of this section, as may be necessary and appropriate to further the purposes, policy, and provisions of this chapter.




(b)
 Treaty renegotiation
The Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary, shall initiate, promptly after 
April 13, 1976
, the renegotiation of any treaty which pertains to fishing within the exclusive economic zone (or within the area that will constitute such zone after 
February 28, 1977
), or for anadromous species or Continental Shelf fishery resources beyond such zone or area, and which is in any manner inconsistent with the purposes, policy, or provisions of this chapter, in order to conform such treaty to such purposes, policy, and provisions. It is the sense of Congress that the United States shall withdraw from any such treaty, in accordance with its provisions, if such treaty is not so renegotiated within a reasonable period of time after

 Import prohibitions
(a)
 Determinations by Secretary of State
If the Secretary of State determines that—
(1)
 he has been unable, within a reasonable period of time, to conclude with any foreign nation an international fishery agreement allowing fishing vessels of the United States equitable access to fisheries over which that nation asserts exclusive fishery management authority, including fisheries for tuna species, as recognized by the United States, in accordance with fishing activities of such vessels, if any, and under terms not more restrictive than those established under sections 1821(c) and (d) and 1824(b)(7) and (10) of this title, because such nation has (A) refused to commence negotiations, or (B) failed to negotiate in good faith;




(2)
 any foreign nation is not allowing fishing vessels of the United States to engage in fishing for tuna species in accordance with an applicable international fishery agreement, whether or not such nation is a party thereto;




(3)
 any foreign nation is not complying with its obligations under any existing international fishery agreement concerning fishing by fishing vessels of the United States in any fishery over which that nation asserts exclusive fishery management authority; or




(4)
 any fishing vessel of the United States, while fishing in waters beyond any foreign nation’s territorial sea, to the extent that such sea is recognized by the United States, is seized by any foreign nation—
(A)
 in violation of an applicable international fishery agreement;




(B)
 without authorization under an agreement between the United States and such nation; or

 Large-scale driftnet fishing
(a)
 Short title
This section incorporates and expands upon provisions of the Driftnet Impact Monitoring, Assessment, and Control Act of 1987 and may be cited as the “Driftnet Act Amendments of 1990”.




(b)
 Findings
The Congress finds that—
(1)
 the continued widespread use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation is a destructive fishing practice that poses a threat to living marine resources of the world’s oceans, including but not limited to the North and South Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea;




(2)
 the use of large-scale driftnets is expanding into new regions of the world’s oceans, including the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea;




(3)
 there is a pressing need for detailed and reliable information on the number of seabirds, sea turtles, nontarget fish, and marine mammals that become entangled and die in actively fished large-scale driftnets and in large-scale driftnets that are lost, abandoned, or discarded;




(4)
 increased efforts, including reliable observer data and enforcement mechanisms, are needed to monitor, assess, control, and reduce the adverse impact of large-scale driftnet fishing on living marine resources;




(5)
 the nations of the world have agreed in the United Nations, through General Assembly Resolution Numbered 44–225, approved 
December 22, 1989
, by the General Assembly, that a moratorium should be imposed by 
June 30, 1992
, on the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation;




(6)
 the nations of the South Pacific have agreed to a moratorium on the use of large-scale driftnets in the South Pacific through the Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific, which was agreed to in Wellington, New Zealand, on 
November 29, 1989
; and




(7)
 increasing population pressures and new knowledge of the importance of living marine resources to the health of the global ecosystem demand that greater responsibility be exercised by persons fishing or developing new fisheries beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.




(c)
 Policy
It is declared to be the policy of the Congress in this section that the United States should—
(1)
 implement the moratorium called for by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution Numbered 44–225;




(2)
 support the Tarawa Declaration and the Wellington Convention for the Prohibition of Fishing with Long Driftnets in the South Pacific; and




(3)
 secure a permanent ban on the use of destructive fishing practices, and in particular large-scale driftnets, by persons or vessels fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.




(d)
 International agreements
The Secretary, through the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall seek to secure international agreements to implement immediately the findings, policy, and provisions of this section, and in particular an international ban on large-scale driftnet fishing. The Secretary, through the Secretary of State, shall include, in any agreement which addresses the taking of living marine resources of the United States, provisions to ensure that—
(1)
 each large-scale driftnet fishing vessel of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement, including vessels that may operate independently to develop new fishing areas, which operate beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is included in such agreement;




(2)
 each large-scale driftnet fishing vessel of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement, which operates beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is equipped with satellite transmitters which provide real-time position information accessible to the United States;




(3)
 statistically reliable monitoring by the United States is carried out, through the use of on-board observers or through dedicated platforms provided by foreign nations that are parties to the agreement, of all target and nontarget fish species, marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds entangled or killed by large-scale driftnets used by fishing vessels of foreign nations that are parties to the agreement;




(4)
 officials of the United States have the right to board and inspect for violations of the agreement any large-scale driftnet fishing vessels operating under the flag of a foreign nation that is party to the agreement at any time while such vessel is operating in designated areas beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation;




(5)
 all catch landed or transshipped at sea by large-scale driftnet fishing vessels of a foreign nation that is a party to the agreement, and which are operated beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation, is reliably monitored and documented;




(6)
 time and area restrictions are imposed on the use of large-scale driftnets in order to prevent interception of anadromous species;




(7)
 all large-scale driftnets used are constructed, insofar as feasible, with biodegradable materials which break into segments that do not represent a threat to living marine resources;




(8)
 all large-scale driftnets are marked at appropriate intervals in a manner that conclusively identifies the vessel and flag nation responsible for each such driftnet;




(9)
 the taking of nontarget fish species, marine mammals, sea turtles, seabirds, and endangered species or other species protected by international agreements to which the United States is a party is minimized and does not pose a threat to existing fisheries or the long-term health of living marine resources; and




(10)
 definitive steps are agreed upon to ensure that parties to the agreement comply with the spirit of other international agreements and resolutions concerning the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.

“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress makes the following findings:
“(1)
 Large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas is highly destructive to the living marine resources and ocean ecosystems of the world’s oceans, including anadromous fish and other living marine resources of the United States.




“(2)
 The cumulative effects of large-scale driftnet fishing pose a significant threat to the marine ecosystem, and slow-reproducing species like marine mammals, sharks, and seabirds may require many years to recover.




“(3)
 Members of the international community have reviewed the best available scientific data on the impacts of large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing, and have failed to conclude that this practice has no significant adverse impacts which threaten the conservation and sustainable management of living marine resources.




“(4)
 The United Nations, via General Assembly Resolutions numbered 44–225, 45–197, and most recently 46–215 (adopted on 
December 20, 1991
), has called for a worldwide moratorium on all high seas driftnet fishing by 
December 31, 1992
, in all the world’s oceans, including enclosed seas and semi-enclosed seas.




“(5)
 The United Nations has commended the unilateral, regional, and international efforts undertaken by members of the international community and international organizations to implement and support the objectives of the General Assembly resolutions.




“(6)
 Operative paragraph (4) of United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46–215 specifically ‘encourages all members of the international community to take measures individually and collectively to prevent large-scale pelagic driftnet fishing operations on the high seas of the world’s oceans and seas’.




“(7)
 The United States, in section 307(1)(M) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (
16 U.S.C. 1857(1)(M)
), has specifically prohibited the practice of large-scale driftnet fishing by United States nationals and vessels both within the exclusive economic zone of the United States and beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.




“(8)
 The Senate, through Senate Resolution 396 of the One Hundredth Congress (approved on 
March 18, 1988
), has called for a moratorium on fishing in the Central Bering Sea and the United States has taken concrete steps to implement such moratorium through international negotiations.




“(9)
 Despite the continued evidence of a decline in the fishery resources of the Bering Sea and the multiyear cooperative negotiations undertaken by the United States, the Russian Federation, Japan, and other concerned fishing nations, some nations refuse to agree to measures to reduce or eliminate unregulated fishing practices in the waters of the Bering Sea beyond the exclusive economic zones of the United States and the Russian Federation.




“(10)
 In order to ensure that the global moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing called for in United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46–215 takes effect by 
December 31, 1992
, and that unregulated fishing practices in the waters of the Central Bering Sea are reduced or eliminated, the United States should take the actions described in this Act [see Short Title of 1992 Amendments note set out under 
section 1801 of this title
] and encourage other nations to take similar action.




“(b)
 
Policy
.—
It is the stated policy of the United States to—
“(1)
 implement United Nations General Assembly Resolution numbered 46–215, approved unanimously on 
December 20, 1991
, which calls for an immediate cessation to further expansion of large-scale driftnet fishing, a 50 percent reduction in existing large-scale driftnet fishing effort by 
June 30, 1992
, and a global moratorium on the use of large-scale driftnets beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation by 
December 31, 1992
;




“(2)
 bring about a moratorium on fishing in the Central Bering Sea, or an international conservation and management agreement to which the United States and the Russian Federation are parties that regulates fishing in the Central Bering Sea; and




“(3)
 secure a permanent ban on the use of destructive fishing practices, and in particular large-scale driftnets, by persons or vessels fishing beyond the exclusive economic zone of any nation.”




 Duration of denial of port privileges and sanctions
Any denial of port privileges or sanction under 
 Definitions
 Prohibition
The United States, or any agency or official acting on behalf of the United States, may not enter into any international agreement with respect to the conservation and management of living marine resources or the use of the high seas by fishing vessels that would prevent full implementation of the global moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas, as such moratorium is expressed in Resolution 46/215 of the United Nations General Assembly.
 Negotiations
The Secretary of State, on behalf of the United States, shall seek to enhance the implementation and effectiveness of the United Nations General Assembly resolutions and decisions regarding the moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas through appropriate international agreements and organizations.
 Certification
The Secretary of State shall determine in writing prior to the signing or provisional application by the United States of any international agreement with respect to the conservation and management of living marine resources or the use of the high seas by fishing vessels that the prohibition contained in 
 Enforcement
The President shall utilize appropriate assets of the Department of Defense, the United States Coast Guard, and other Federal agencies to detect, monitor, and prevent violations of the United Nations moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas for all fisheries under the jurisdiction of the United States and, in the case of fisheries not under the jurisdiction of the United States, to the fullest extent permitted under international law.

Dec. 22, 2010
] or any subsequent modifications to the license limitation program recommended by the Council and approved by the Secretary.


“(a)
 
In General
.—
An eligible member that elects not to participate in a single fishery cooperative approved under section 2 shall operate in a non-cooperative limited access fishery subject to the license limitation program in effect for the longline catcher processor subsector on the date of enactment of this Act [
Dec. 22, 2010
] or any subsequent modifications to the license limitation program recommended by the Council and approved by the Secretary.


“(b)
 
Harvest and Prohibited Species Allocations
.—
Eligible members operating in a non-cooperative limited access fishery under this section may collectively—
“(1)
 harvest the percentage of BSAI Pacific cod total allowable catch equal to the combined average percentage of the BSAI Pacific cod harvest allocated to the longline catcher processor sector and retained by the vessel or vessels designated on the eligible members license limitation program license or licenses for 2006, 2007, and 2008, according to the catch accounting system data used to establish total catch; and




“(2)
 utilize the percentage of BSAI Pacific cod prohibited species catch allocation equal to the percentage calculated under paragraph (1).




“(a)
 
In General
.—
Nothing in this Act shall supersede the authority of the Council to recommend for approval by the Secretary such conservation and management measures, in accordance with the Magnuson-Stevens Act (
16 U.S.C. 1801
 et seq.) as it considers necessary to ensure that this Act does not diminish the effectiveness of fishery management in the BSAI or the Gulf of Alaska Pacific cod fishery.

Dec. 22, 2010
], that application of section 303A(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act to the cooperative approved under section 2 of this Act would be inconsistent with the purposes for which section 303A was added to the Magnuson-Stevens Act.


“(c)
 
Cost Recovery
.—
Consistent with section 304(d)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (
16 U.S.C. 1854(d)(2)

For the purposes of this subsection, a catcher vessel shall be considered a ‘qualified catcher vessel’ if, during the year prior to the year in which the fishery cooperative will be in effect, it delivered more pollock to the shoreside processor to which it will deliver pollock under the fishery cooperative in paragraph (1) than to any other shoreside processor.




“(4)
 
Consideration of certain vessels
.—
Any contract implementing a fishery cooperative under paragraph (1) which has been entered into by the owner of a qualified catcher vessel eligible under section 208(a) that harvested pollock for processing by catcher/processors or motherships in the directed pollock fishery during 1995, 1996, and 1997 shall, to the extent practicable, provide fair and equitable terms and conditions for the owner of such qualified catcher vessel.




“(5)
 
Open access
.—
A catcher vessel eligible under section 208(a) the catch history of which has not been attributed to a fishery cooperative under paragraph (1) may be used to deliver pollock harvested by such vessel from the directed fishing allowance under section 206(b)(1) (other than pollock reserved under paragraph (1) for a fishery cooperative) to any of the shoreside processors eligible under section 208(f). A catcher vessel eligible under section 208(a) the catch history of which has been attributed to a fishery cooperative under paragraph (1) during any calendar year may not harvest any pollock apportioned under section 206(b)(1) in such calendar year other than the pollock reserved under paragraph (1) for such fishery cooperative.




“(6)
 
Transfer of cooperative harvest
.—
A contract implementing a fishery cooperative under paragraph (1) may, notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, provide for up to 10 percent of the pollock harvested under such cooperative to be processed by a shoreside processor eligible under section 208(f) other than the shoreside processor to which pollock will be delivered under paragraph (1).




“(7)
 Fishery cooperative exit provisions.—
“(A)
 
Fishing allowance determination
.—
For purposes of determining the aggregate percentage of directed fishing allowances under paragraph (1), when a catcher vessel is removed from the directed pollock fishery, the fishery allowance for pollock for the vessel being removed—
“(i)
 shall be based on the catch history determination for the vessel made pursuant to section 679.62 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010 [
Oct. 15, 2010
]; and




“(ii)
 shall be assigned, for all purposes under this title, in the manner specified by the owner of the vessel being removed to any other catcher vessel or among other catcher vessels participating in the fishery cooperative if such vessel or vessels remain in the fishery cooperative for at least one year after the date on which the vessel being removed leaves the directed pollock fishery.






“(B)
 
Eligibility for fishery endorsement
.—
Except as provided in subparagraph (C), a vessel that is removed pursuant to this paragraph shall be permanently ineligible for a fishery endorsement, and any claim (including relating to catch history) associated with such vessel that could qualify any owner of such vessel for any permit to participate in any fishery within the exclusive economic zone of the United States shall be extinguished, unless such removed vessel is thereafter designated to replace a vessel to be removed pursuant to this paragraph.




“(C)
 
Limitations on statutory construction
.—
Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed—
“(i)
 to make the vessels AJ (United States official number 905625), DONA MARTITA (United States official number 651751), NORDIC EXPLORER (United States official number 678234), and PROVIDIAN (United States official number 1062183) ineligible for a fishery endorsement or any permit necessary to participate in any fishery under the authority of the New England Fishery Management Council or the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council established, respectively, under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 302(a)(1) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act [
16 U.S.C. 1852(a)(1)
]; or




“(ii)
 to allow the vessels referred to in clause (i) to participate in any fishery under the authority of the Councils referred to in clause (i) in any manner that is not consistent with the fishery management plan for the fishery developed by the Councils under section 303 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act [
16 U.S.C. 1853
].








“(c)
 
Catcher Vessels to Catcher/Processors
.—
Effective 
January 1, 1999
, not less than 8.5 percent of the directed fishing allowance under section 206(b)(2) shall be available for harvest only by the catcher vessels eligible under section 208(b). The owners of such catcher vessels may participate in a fishery cooperative with the owners of the catcher/processors eligible under paragraphs (1) through (20) of the section 208(e). The owners of such catcher vessels may participate in a fishery cooperative that will be in effect during 1999 only if the contract implementing such cooperative establishes penalties to prevent such vessels from exceeding in 1999 the traditional levels harvested by such vessels in all other fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the United States.


“(d)
 Catcher Vessels to Motherships.—
“(1)
 
Processing
.—
Effective 
January 1, 2000
, the authority in 
section 1 of the Act of June 25, 1934
 (
48 Stat. 1213
 and 1214; 
15 U.S.C. 521
 et seq.) shall extend to processing by motherships eligible under section 208(d) solely for the purposes of forming or participating in a fishery cooperative in the directed pollock fishery upon the filing of a contract to implement a fishery cooperative under subsection (a) which has been entered into by the owners of 80 percent or more of the catcher vessels eligible under section 208(c) for the duration of such contract, provided that such owners agree to the terms of the fishery cooperative involving processing by the motherships.




“(2)
 
Voluntary participation
.—
Any contract implementing a fishery cooperative described in paragraph (1) must allow the owners of any other catcher vessels eligible under section 208(c) to enter such contract after it is filed and before the calendar year in which fishing will begin under the same terms and conditions as the owners of the catcher vessels who entered into such contract upon filing.




“(e)
 Excessive Shares.—
“(1)
 
Harvesting
.—
No particular individual, corporation, or other entity may harvest, through a fishery cooperative or otherwise, a total of more than 17.5 percent of the pollock available to be harvested in the directed pollock fishery.




“(2)
 
Processing
.—
Under the authority of section 301(a)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (
16 U.S.C. 1851(a)(4)
), the North Pacific Council is directed to recommend for approval by the Secretary conservation and management measures to prevent any particular individual or entity from processing an excessive share of the pollock available to be harvested in the directed pollock fishery. In the event the North Pacific Council recommends and the Secretary approves an excessive processing share that is lower than 17.5 percent, any individual or entity that previously processed a percentage greater than such share shall be allowed to continue to process such percentage, except that their percentage may not exceed 17.5 percent (excluding pollock processed by catcher/processors that was harvested in the directed pollock fishery by catcher vessels eligible under 208(b)) and shall be reduced if their percentage decreases, until their percentage is below such share. In recommending the excessive processing share, the North Pacific Council shall consider the need of catcher vessels in the directed pollock fishery to have competitive buyers for the pollock harvested by such vessels.




“(3)
 
Review by maritime administration
.—
At the request of the North Pacific Council or the Secretary, any individual or entity believed by such Council or the Secretary to have exceeded the percentage in either paragraph (1) or (2) shall submit such information to the Administrator of the Maritime Administration as the Administrator deems appropriate to allow the Administrator to determine whether such individual or entity has exceeded either such percentage. The Administrator shall make a finding as soon as practicable upon such request and shall submit such finding to the North Pacific Council and the Secretary. For the purposes of this subsection, any entity in which 10 percent or more of the interest is owned or controlled by another individual or entity shall be considered to be the same entity as the other individual or entity.




“(f)
 
Landing Tax Jurisdiction
.—
Any contract filed under subsection (a) shall include a contract clause under which the parties to the contract agree to make payments to the State of Alaska for any pollock harvested in the directed pollock fishery which is not landed in the State of Alaska, in amounts which would otherwise accrue had the pollock been landed in the State of Alaska subject to any landing taxes established under Alaska law. Failure to include such a contract clause or for such amounts to be paid shall result in a revocation of the authority to form fishery cooperatives under 
section 1 of the Act of June 25, 1934
 (
15 U.S.C. 521
 et seq.).


“(g)

(e)
 Rebuilding overfished fisheries
(1)
 The Secretary shall report annually to the Congress and the Councils on the status of fisheries within each Council’s geographical area of authority and identify those fisheries that are overfished or are approaching a condition of being overfished. For those fisheries managed under a fishery management plan or international agreement, the status shall be determined using the criteria for overfishing specified in such plan or agreement. A fishery shall be classified as approaching a condition of being overfished if, based on trends in fishing effort, fishery resource size, and other appropriate factors, the Secretary estimates that the fishery will become overfished within two years.




(2)
 If the Secretary determines at any time that a fishery is overfished, the Secretary shall immediately notify the appropriate Council and request that action be taken to end overfishing in the fishery and to implement conservation and management measures to rebuild affected stocks of fish. The Secretary shall publish each notice under this paragraph in the Federal Register.




(3)
 Within 2 years after an identification under paragraph (1) or notification under paragraphs (2) or (7), the appropriate Council (or the Secretary, for fisheries under 
section 1852(a)(3) of this title
) shall prepare and implement a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations for the fishery to which the identification or notice applies—
(A)
 to end overfishing immediately in the fishery and to rebuild affected stocks of fish; or




(B)
 to prevent overfishing from occurring in the fishery whenever such fishery is identified as approaching an overfished condition.






(4)
 For a fishery that is overfished, any fishery management plan, amendment, or proposed regulations prepared pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (5) for such fishery shall—
(A)
 specify a time period for rebuilding the fishery that shall—
(i)
 be as short as possible, taking into account the status and biology of any overfished stocks of fish, the needs of fishing communities, recommendations by international organizations in which the United States participates, and the interaction of the overfished stock of fish within the marine ecosystem; and




(ii)
 not exceed 10 years, except in cases where the biology of the stock of fish, other environmental conditions, or management measures under an international agreement in which the United States participates dictate otherwise;






(B)
 allocate both overfishing restrictions and recovery benefits fairly and equitably among sectors of the fishery; and




(C)
 for fisheries managed under an international agreement, reflect traditional participation in the fishery, relative to other nations, by fishermen of the United States.






(5)
 If, within the 2-year period beginning on the date of identification or notification that a fishery is overfished, the Council does not submit to the Secretary a fishery management plan, plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary shall prepare a fishery management plan or plan amendment and any accompanying regulations to stop overfishing and rebuild affected stocks of fish within 9 months under subsection (c) of this section.




(6)
 During the development of a fishery management plan, a plan amendment, or proposed regulations required by this subsection, the Council may request the Secretary to implement interim measures to reduce overfishing under 
section 1855(c) of this title
 until such measures can be replaced by such plan, amendment, or regulations. Such measures, if otherwise in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, may be implemented even though they are not sufficient by themselves to stop overfishing of a fishery.




(7)
 The Secretary shall review any fishery management plan, plan amendment, or regulations required by this subsection at routine intervals that may not exceed two years. If the Secretary finds as a result of the review that such plan, amendment, or regulations have not resulted in adequate progress toward ending overfishing and rebuilding affected fish stocks, the Secretary shall—
(A)
 in the case of a fishery to which 
section 1852(a)(3) of this title
 applies, immediately make revisions necessary to achieve adequate progress; or




(B)
 for all other fisheries, immediately notify the appropriate Council. Such notification shall recommend further conservation and management measures which the Council should consider under paragraph (3) to achieve adequate progress.






(f)

(B)
 The fishery management plan for the fishery in which the fishing vessel is operating delegates management of the fishery to a State and the State’s laws and regulations are consistent with such fishery management plan. If at any time the Secretary determines that a State law or regulation applicable to a fishing vessel under this circumstance is not consistent with the fishery management plan, the Secretary shall promptly notify the State and the appropriate Council of such determination and provide an opportunity for the State to correct any inconsistencies identified in the notification. If, after notice and opportunity for corrective action, the State does not correct the inconsistencies identified by the Secretary, the authority granted to the State under this subparagraph shall not apply until the Secretary and the appropriate Council find that the State has corrected the inconsistencies. For a fishery for which there was a fishery management plan in place on 
August 1, 1996
 that did not delegate management of the fishery to a State as of that date, the authority provided by this subparagraph applies only if the Council approves the delegation of management of the fishery to the State by a three-quarters majority vote of the voting members of the Council.

The authority provided under this subparagraph shall terminate when a fishery management plan under this chapter is approved and implemented for such fishery.






(b)
 Exception
(1)
 If the Secretary finds, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with 
section 554 of title 5
, that—
(A)
 the fishing in a fishery, which is covered by a fishery management plan implemented under this chapter, is engaged in predominately within the exclusive economic zone and beyond such zone; and




(B)
 any State has taken any action, or omitted to take any action, the results of which will substantially and adversely affect the carrying out of such fishery management plan;





the Secretary shall promptly notify such State and the appropriate Council of such finding and of his intention to regulate the applicable fishery within the boundaries of such State (other than its internal waters), pursuant to such fishery management plan and the regulations promulgated to implement such plan.




(2)
 If the Secretary, pursuant to this subsection, assumes responsibility for the regulation of any fishery, the State involved may at any time thereafter apply to the Secretary for reinstatement of its authority over such fishery. If the Secretary finds that the reasons for which he assumed such regulation no longer prevail, he shall promptly terminate such regulation.




(3)
 If the State involved requests that a hearing be held pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall conduct such hearing prior to taking any action under paragraph (1).

(A)
 for a fishery which occurs in the waters of more than one State or in the exclusive economic zone, except after—
(i)
 consulting with the appropriate Council and Marine Fisheries Commission, and




(ii)
 considering any comments received from the Governor of any other State where the fishery occurs; and






(B)
 if the Governor determines that fish processors within the State have adequate capacity, and will utilize such capacity, to process all of the United States harvested fish from the fishery concerned that are landed in the State.






(3)
 Nothing in this subsection may be construed as relieving a foreign fishing vessel from the duty to comply with all applicable Federal and State laws while operating within the internal waters of a State incident to permission obtained under paragraph (1)(B).




(4)
 For purposes of this subsection—
(A)
 The term “fish processing” includes, in addition to processing, the performance of any other activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, or transportation.




(B)
