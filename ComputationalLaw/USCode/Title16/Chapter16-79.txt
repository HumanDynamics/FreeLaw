 Congressional findings and statement of policy
(a)
 Findings
In furtherance of sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of this title, which directs the Secretary to administer units of the National Park System in accordance with the fundamental purpose of conserving their scenery, wildlife, and natural and historic objects, and providing for their enjoyment in a manner that will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations, the Congress hereby finds that the preservation and conservation of park resources and values requires that such public accommodations, facilities, and services as have to be provided within such units should be provided only under carefully controlled safeguards against unregulated and indiscriminate use, so that—
(1)
 visitation will not unduly impair these resources and values; and




(2)
 development of public accommodations, facilities, and services within such units can best be limited to locations that are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of such units.




(b)
 Policy
It is the policy of the Congress that the development of public accommodations, facilities, and services in units of the National Park System shall be limited to those accommodations, facilities, and services that—
(1)
 are necessary and appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the National Park System in which they are located; and




(2)
 are consistent to the highest practicable degree with the preservation and conservation of the resources and values of the unit.

 Award of concessions contracts
 Term of concessions contracts
A concessions contract entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall generally be awarded for a term of 10 years or less. However, the Secretary may award a contract for a term of up to 20 years if the Secretary determines that the contract terms and conditions, including the required construction of capital improvements, warrant a longer term.
 Protection of concessioner investment
(a)
 Leasehold surrender interest under new concessions contracts
On or after 
November 13, 1998
, a concessioner that constructs a capital improvement upon land owned by the United States within a unit of the National Park System pursuant to a concessions contract shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement subject to the following terms and conditions:
(1)
 A concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in each capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a concessions contract, consisting solely of a right to compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the value of the concessioner’s leasehold surrender interest in the capital improvement.




(2)
 A leasehold surrender interest—
(A)
 may be pledged as security for financing of a capital improvement or the acquisition of a concessions contract when approved by the Secretary pursuant to this subchapter;




(B)
 shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection with any transfer of the concessions contract and may be relinquished or waived by the concessioner; and




(C)
 shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other termination of a concessions contract and may not be taken for public use except on payment of just compensation.






(3)
 The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), increased (or decreased) in the same percentage increase (or decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison with a new unit of like kind.




(4)
 Effective 9 years after 
November 13, 1998
, the Secretary may provide, in any particular new concession contract the Secretary estimates will have a leasehold surrender interest of more than $10,000,000, that the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement shall be based on either (A) a reduction on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same number of years as the time period associated with the straight line depreciation of the initial value (construction cost of the capital improvement), as provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and regulations in effect on the day before 
November 13, 1998
, or (B) such alternative formula that is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter. The Secretary may only use such an alternative formula if the Secretary determines, after scrutiny of the financial and other circumstances involved in this particular concession contract (including providing notice in the Federal Register and opportunity for comment), that such alternative formula is, compared to the standard method of determining value provided for in paragraph (3), necessary in order to provide a fair return to the Government and to foster competition for the new contract by providing a reasonable opportunity to make a profit under the new contract. If no responsive offers are received in response to a solicitation that includes such an alternative formula, the concession opportunity shall be resolicited with the leasehold surrender interest value as described in paragraph (3).




(5)
 Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a concessions contract, makes a capital improvement to an existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a leasehold surrender interest, the cost of such additional capital improvement shall be added to the then current value of the concessioner’s leasehold surrender interest.




(b)
 Special rule for existing possessory interest
(1)
 A concessioner which has obtained a possessory interest as defined pursuant to 
Public Law 89–249
 (commonly known as the National Park Service Concessions Policy Act; 
16 U.S.C. 20
 et seq.), as in effect on the day before 
November 13, 1998
, under the terms of a concessions contract entered into before 
November 13, 1998
, shall, upon the expiration or termination of such contract, be entitled to receive compensation for such possessory interest improvements in the amount and manner as described by such concessions contract. Where such a possessory interest is not described in the existing contract, compensation of possessory interest shall be determined in accordance with the laws in effect on the day before 
November 13, 1998
.




(2)
 In the event such prior concessioner is awarded a new concessions contract after the effective date of this subchapter replacing an existing concessions contract, the existing concessioner shall, instead of directly receiving such possessory interest compensation, have a leasehold surrender interest in its existing possessory interest improvements under the terms of the new contract and shall carry over as the initial value of such leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous contract. In the event of a dispute between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of such possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved through binding arbitration.




(3)
 In the event that a new concessioner is awarded a concessions contract and is required to pay a prior concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements, the new concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such prior improvements and the initial value in such leasehold surrender interest (instead of construction cost), shall be an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory interest as of the termination date of the previous contract.




(c)
 Transition to successor concessioner
Upon expiration or termination of a concessions contract entered into after the effective date of this subchapter, a concessioner shall be entitled under the terms of the concessions contract to receive from the United States or a successor concessioner the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital improvement as of the date of such expiration or termination. A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement under the terms of a new contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement (instead of construction cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold surrender interest under the terms of the prior concessions contract.




(d)
 Title to improvements
Title to any capital improvement constructed by a concessioner on lands owned by the United States in a unit of the National Park System shall be vested in the United States.

(b)
 Approval by Secretary required
A concessioner’s rates and charges to the public shall be subject to approval by the Secretary. The approval process utilized by the Secretary shall be as prompt and as unburdensome to the concessioner as possible and shall rely on market forces to establish reasonableness of rates and charges to the maximum extent practicable. The Secretary shall approve rates and charges that the Secretary determines to be reasonable and appropriate. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, the reasonableness and appropriateness of rates and charges shall be determined primarily by comparison with those rates and charges for facilities, goods, and services of comparable character under similar conditions, with due consideration to the following factors and other factors deemed relevant by the Secretary: length of season, peakloads, average percentage of occupancy, accessibility, availability and costs of labor and materials, and type of patronage. Such rates and charges may not exceed the market rates and charges for comparable facilities, goods, and services, after taking into account the factors referred to in the preceding sentence.




(c)
 Implementation of recommendations

 Franchise fees
(a)
 In general
A concessions contract shall provide for payment to the government of a franchise fee or such other monetary consideration as determined by the Secretary, upon consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of the privileges granted by the particular contract involved. Such probable value shall be based upon a reasonable opportunity for net profit in relation to capital invested and the obligations of the contract. Consideration of revenue to the United States shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting and preserving park areas and of providing necessary and appropriate services for visitors at reasonable rates.




(b)
 Amount of franchise fee
The amount of the franchise fee or other monetary consideration paid to the United States for the term of the concessions contract shall be specified in the concessions contract and may only be modified to reflect extraordinary unanticipated changes from the conditions anticipated as of the effective date of the contract. The Secretary shall include in concessions contracts with a term of more than 5 years a provision which allows reconsideration of the franchise fee at the request of the Secretary or the concessioner in the event of such extraordinary unanticipated changes. Such provision shall provide for binding arbitration in the event that the Secretary and the concessioner are unable to agree upon an adjustment to the franchise fee in these circumstances.




(c)
 Special account
All franchise fees (and other monetary consideration) paid to the United States pursuant to concessions contracts shall be deposited into a special account established in the Treasury of the United States. Twenty percent of the funds deposited in the special account shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation, to support activities throughout the National Park System regardless of the unit of the National Park System in which the funds were collected. The funds deposited into the special account shall remain available until expended.

 Subaccount for each unit
There shall be established within the special account required under subsection (c) of this section a subaccount for each unit of the National Park System. Each subaccount shall be credited with 80 percent of the franchise fees (and other monetary consideration) collected at a single unit of the National Park System under concessions contracts. The funds credited to the subaccount for a unit of the National Park System shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary, without further appropriation, for use at the unit for visitor services and for purposes of funding high-priority and urgently necessary resource management programs and operations. The funds credited to a subaccount shall remain available until expended.

 the individual, corporation or entity seeking to acquire a concessions contract is not qualified or able to satisfy the terms and conditions of the concessions contract;




(2)
 such transfer or conveyance would have an adverse impact on (A) the protection, conservation, or preservation of the resources of the unit of the National Park System or (B) the provision of necessary and appropriate facilities and services to visitors at reasonable rates and charges; and




(3)
 the terms of such transfer or conveyance are likely, directly or indirectly, to reduce the concessioner’s opportunity for a reasonable profit over the remaining term of the contract, adversely affect the quality of facilities and services provided by the concessioner, or result in a need for increased rates and charges to the public to maintain the quality of such facilities and services.




(c)
 Transfer terms
The terms and conditions of any contract under this section shall not be subject to modification or open to renegotiation by the Secretary because of a transfer or conveyance described in subsection (a) of this section, unless such transfer or conveyance would have an adverse impact as described in paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section.
