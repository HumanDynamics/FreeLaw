“(a)
 
Findings
.—
The Congress finds the following:
“(1)
 The winter index population of mid-continent light geese was 800,000 birds in 1969, while the total population of such geese is more than 5,200,000 birds today.




“(2)
 The population of mid-continent light geese is expanding by over 5 percent each year, and in the absence of new wildlife management actions it could grow to more than 6,800,000 breeding light geese in 3 years.




“(3)
 The primary reasons for this unprecedented population growth are—
“(A)
 the expansion of agricultural areas and the resulting abundance of cereal grain crops in the United States;




“(B)
 the establishment of sanctuaries along the United States flyways of migrating light geese; and




“(C)
 a decline in light geese harvest rates.






“(4)
 As a direct result of this population explosion, the Hudson Bay Lowlands Salt-Marsh ecosystem in Canada is being systematically destroyed. This ecosystem contains approximately 135,000 acres of essential habitat for migrating light geese and many other avian species. Biologists have testified that one-third of this habitat has been destroyed, one-third is on the brink of devastation, and the remaining one-third is overgrazed.




“(5)
 The destruction of the Arctic tundra is having a severe negative impact on many avian species that breed or migrate through this habitat, including the following:
“(A)
 Canada Goose.




“(B)
 American Wigeon.




“(C)
 Dowitcher.




“(D)
 Hudsonian Godwit.




“(E)
 Stilt Sandpiper.




“(F)
 Northern Shoveler.




“(G)
 Red-Breasted Merganser.




“(H)
 Oldsquaw.




“(I)
 Parasitic Jaeger.




“(J)
 Whimbrel.




“(K)
 Yellow Rail.






“(6)
 It is essential that the current population of mid-continent light geese be reduced by 50 percent by the year 2005 to ensure that the fragile Arctic tundra is not irreversibly damaged.




“(b)
 
Purposes
.—
The purposes of this Act are the following:
“(1)
 To reduce the population of mid-continent light geese.




“(2)
 To assure the long-term conservation of mid-continent light geese and the biological diversity of the ecosystem upon which many North American migratory birds depend.




“(a)
 Force and Effect.—
“(1)
 
In general
.—
The rules published by the Service on 
February 16, 1999
, relating to use of additional hunting methods to increase the harvest of mid-continent light geese (64 Fed. Reg. 7507–7517) and the establishment of a conservation order for the reduction of mid-continent light goose populations (64 Fed. Reg. 7517–7528), shall have the force and effect of law.




“(2)
 
Public notice
.—
The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Service, shall take such action as is necessary to appropriately notify the public of the force and effect of the rules referred to in paragraph (1).




“(b)
 
Application
.—
Subsection (a) shall apply only during the period that—
“(1)
 begins on the date of the enactment of this Act [
Nov. 24, 1999
]; and




“(2)
 ends on the latest of—
“(A)
 the effective date of rules issued by the Service after such date of the enactment to control overabundant mid-continent light geese populations;




“(B)
 the date of the publication of a final environmental impact statement for such rules under section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (
42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)
); and




“(C)
 
May 15, 2001
.






“(c)
 
Rule of Construction
.—
This section shall not be construed to limit the authority of the Secretary or the Service to issue rules, under another law, to regulate the taking of mid-continent light geese.


“(a)
 
In General
.—
Not later than the end of the period described in section 103(b) [probably means section 3(b)], the Secretary shall prepare, and as appropriate implement, a comprehensive, long-term plan for the management of mid-continent light geese and the conservation of their habitat.


“(b)
 
Required Elements
.—
The plan shall apply principles of adaptive resource management and shall include—
“(1)
 a description of methods for monitoring the levels of populations and the levels of harvest of mid-continent light geese, and recommendations concerning long-term harvest levels;




“(2)
 recommendations concerning other means for the management of mid-continent light goose populations, taking into account the reasons for the population growth specified in section 102(a)(3) [probably means section 2(a)(3)];




“(3)
 an assessment of, and recommendations relating to, conservation of the breeding habitat of mid-continent light geese;




“(4)
 an assessment of, and recommendations relating to, conservation of native species of wildlife adversely affected by the overabundance of mid-continent light geese, including the species specified in section 102(a)(5) [probably means section 2(a)(5)]; and

September 30, 1979
, to each county in which is situated any fee area whichever of the following amounts is greater:
(A)
 An amount equal to the product of 75 cents multiplied by the total acreage of that portion of the fee area which is located within such county.




(B)
 An amount equal to three-fourths of 1 per centum of the fair market value, as determined by the Secretary, of that portion of the fee area (excluding any improvements thereto made after the date of Federal acquisition) which is located within such county.




(C)
 An amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such fee area during such fiscal year; but if a fee area is located in two or more counties, the amount each such county is entitled to shall be the amount which bears to such 25 per centum the same ratio as that portion of the fee area acreage which is within such county bears to the total acreage of such fee area.






(2)
 At the end of each fiscal year the Secretary shall pay out of the fund for such fiscal year to each county in which any reserve area is situated, an amount equal to 25 per centum of the net receipts collected by the Secretary in connection with the operation and management of such area during such fiscal year: 
Provided
, That when any such area is situated in more than one county the distributive share to each county from the aforesaid receipts shall be proportional to its acreage of such reserve area.




(3)
 For purposes of this section, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands shall each be treated as a county.




(4)
(A)
 For purposes of determining the fair market value of fee areas under paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall—

 appraise before 
September 30, 1979
, all fee areas for which payments under this section were not authorized for fiscal years occurring before 
October 1, 1977
; and

 appraise all other fee areas, within five years after 
October 17, 1978
, in the order in which such areas were first established by the Service.





After initial appraisal under clause (i) or (ii), each fee area shall thereafter be reappraised by the Secretary at least once during each five-year period occurring after the date of the initial appraisal. Until any fee area referred to in clause (ii) is initially appraised under this subparagraph, the fair market value of such area shall be deemed to be that adjusted cost of the area which was used to determine payments under this subsection for fiscal year 1977; and in no case may the amount of any payment to any local government under paragraph (1)(B) with respect to any fee area be less than the amount paid under paragraph (2)(A) of this subsection (as in effect on 
September 30, 1977
) with respect to such area.




(B)
 The Secretary shall make the determinations required under this subsection in such manner as the Secretary considers to be equitable and in the public interest. All such determinations shall be final and conclusive.






(5)
(A)
 Each county which receives payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to any fee area or reserve area shall distribute, under guidelines established by the Secretary, such payments on a proportional basis to those units of local government (including, but not limited to, school districts and the county itself in appropriate cases) which have incurred the loss or reduction of real property tax revenues by reason of the existence of such area. In any case in which a unit of local government other than the county acts as the collecting and distributing agency for real property taxes, the payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be made to such other unit which shall distribute the payments in accordance with the guidelines.




(B)
 The Secretary may prescribe regulations under which payments under this paragraph may be made to units of local government in cases in which subparagraph (A) will not effect the purposes of this paragraph.




(C)
 Payments received by units of local government under this subsection may be used by such units for any governmental purpose.
