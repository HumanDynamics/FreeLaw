Chapter 71A
ATLANTIC STRIPED BASS CONSERVATION
 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds and declares the following:
(1)
 Atlantic striped bass are of historic commercial and recreational importance and economic benefit to the Atlantic coastal States and to the Nation.




(2)
 No single government entity has full management authority throughout the range of the Atlantic striped bass.




(3)
 The population of Atlantic striped bass—
(A)
 has been subject to large fluctuations due to natural causes, fishing pressure, environmental pollution, loss and alteration of habitat, inadequacy of fisheries conservation and management practices, and other causes; and




(B)
 risks potential depletion in the future without effective monitoring and conservation and management measures.






(4)
 It is in the national interest to implement effective procedures and measures to provide for effective interjurisdictional conservation and management of this species.




(b)
 Purpose
It is therefore declared to be the purpose of the Congress in this chapter to support and encourage the development, implementation, and enforcement of effective interstate action regarding the conservation and management of the Atlantic striped bass.




 Definitions
 Monitoring of implementation and enforcement by coastal States
(a)

(b)
 Satisfactory State enforcement
For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, enforcement by a coastal State shall not be considered satisfactory by the Commission if, in its view, the enforcement is being carried out in such a manner that the implementation of the Plan within the coastal waters of the State is being, or will likely be, substantially and adversely affected.

 of a negative determination regarding a coastal State, the Secretaries shall determine jointly, within 30 days, whether that coastal State is in compliance with the Plan and, if the State is not in compliance, the Secretaries shall declare jointly a moratorium on fishing for Atlantic striped bass within the coastal waters of that coastal State. In making such a determination, the Secretaries shall carefully consider and review the comments of the Commission and that coastal State in question.

 Prohibited acts during moratorium
During a moratorium period, it is unlawful for any person—
(1)
 to engage in fishing within the moratorium area;




(2)

(3)
 to land lawfully harvested Atlantic striped bass within the boundaries of a coastal State when a moratorium declared under subsection (a) of this section applies to that State; or




(4)
 to fail to return to the water Atlantic striped bass to which the moratorium applies that are caught incidental to harvesting that occurs in the course of commercial or recreational fish catching activities, regardless of the physical condition of the striped bass when caught.




(c)
 Civil penalties

 Continuing studies of striped bass populations
(a)
 In general

(1)
 Annual stock assessments, using fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data, for the purposes of extending the long-term population record generated by the annual striped bass study conducted by the Secretaries before 1994 and understanding the population dynamics of Atlantic striped bass.




(2)
 Investigations of the causes of fluctuations in Atlantic striped bass populations.




(3)
 Investigations of the effects of water quality, land use, and other environmental factors on the recruitment, spawning potential, mortality, and abundance of Atlantic striped bass populations, including the Delaware River population.




(4)
 Investigations of—
(A)
 the interactions between Atlantic striped bass and other fish, including bluefish, menhaden, mackerel, and other forage fish or possible competitors, stock assessments of these species, to the extent appropriate; and




(B)
 the effects of interspecies predation and competition on the recruitment, spawning potential mortality, and abundance of Atlantic striped bass.
