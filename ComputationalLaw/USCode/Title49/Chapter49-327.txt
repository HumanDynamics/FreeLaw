 the person shall adjust the odometer to read zero; and

 Disclosure that the actual mileage is unknown, if the transferor knows that the odometer reading is different from the number of miles the vehicle has actually traveled.

(B)
 For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “new motor vehicle” means any motor vehicle driven with no more than the limited use necessary in moving, transporting, or road testing such vehicle prior to delivery from the vehicle manufacturer to a dealer, but in no event shall the odometer reading of such vehicle exceed 300 miles.

Mileage Statement Requirement for Licensing
.—
(1)
 A motor vehicle the ownership of which is transferred may not be licensed for use in a State unless the transferee, in submitting an application to a State for the title on which the license will be issued, includes with the application the transferor’s title and, if that title contains the space referred to in paragraph (3)(A)(iii) of this subsection, a statement, signed and dated by the transferor, of the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section. This paragraph does not apply to a transfer of ownership of a motor vehicle that has not been licensed before the transfer.




(2)
(A)
 Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, if the title to a motor vehicle issued to a transferor by a State is in the possession of a lienholder when the transferor transfers ownership of the vehicle, the transferor may use a written power of attorney (if allowed by State law) in making the mileage disclosure required under subsection (a) of this section.

(v)
 may require that the State retain the power of attorney and the copy of the title for an appropriate period or that the State adopt alternative measures consistent with 
section 32701(b) of this title
, after considering the costs to the State;




(vi)
 shall ensure that the mileage at the time of transfer be disclosed on the power of attorney document;




(vii)

(viii)
 may not require that a motor vehicle be titled in the State in which the power of attorney was issued;




(ix)
 shall consider the need to facilitate normal commercial transactions in the sale or exchange of motor vehicles; and

 If the lessor transfers ownership of a leased motor vehicle without obtaining possession of the vehicle, the lessor, in making the disclosure required by subsection (a) of this section, may indicate on the title the mileage disclosed by the lessee under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the lessor has reason to believe that the disclosure by the lessee does not reflect the actual mileage of the vehicle.




(d)
 
State Alternate Vehicle Mileage Disclosure Requirements
.—
The requirements of subsections (b) and (c)(1) of this section on the disclosure of motor vehicle mileage when motor vehicles are transferred or leased apply in a State unless the State has in effect alternate motor vehicle mileage disclosure requirements approved by the Secretary.
