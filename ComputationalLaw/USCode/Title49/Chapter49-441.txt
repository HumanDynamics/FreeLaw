.—
A person may operate an aircraft in the United States that is not registered—
(1)
 when authorized under section 40103(d) or 41703 of this title;

“(a)
 
In General

], including any amendments made by this Act.


“(b)
 
Contents of Regulations
.—
Regulations to be issued under this Act shall specify, at a minimum, the requirements for—

 the registration of aircraft previously registered in a country in which the Cape Town Treaty is in effect; and




“(2)
 the cancellation of registration of a civil aircraft of the United States based on a request made in accordance with the Cape Town Treaty.




“(c)
 Expedited Rulemaking Process.—

Final rule
.—
The Administrator shall issue regulations under this section by publishing a final rule by 
December 31, 2004
.




“(2)
 
Effective date

The final rule shall not be effective before the date the Cape Town Treaty enters into force with respect to the United States [
Mar. 1, 2006

December 31, 2004
.”


“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress finds the following:
“(1)
 The Cape Town Treaty (as defined in 
section 44113 of title 49
, United States Code) extends modern commercial laws for the sale, finance, and lease of aircraft and aircraft engines to the international arena in a manner consistent with United States law and practice.




“(2)
 The Cape Town Treaty provides for internationally established and recognized financing and leasing rights that will provide greater security and commercial predictability in connection with the financing and leasing of highly mobile assets, such as aircraft and aircraft engines.




“(3)
 The legal and financing framework of the Cape Town Treaty will provide substantial economic benefits to the aviation and aerospace sectors, including the promotion of exports, and will facilitate the acquisition of newer, safer aircraft around the world.




“(4)
 Only technical changes to United States law and regulations are required since the asset-based financing and leasing concepts embodied in the Cape Town Treaty are already reflected in the United States in the Uniform Commercial Code.




“(5)
 The new electronic registry system established under the Cape Town Treaty will work in tandem with current aircraft document recordation systems of the Federal Aviation Administration, which have served United States industry well.




“(6)
 The United States Government was a leader in the development of the Cape Town Treaty.




“(b)
 
Purpose
.—
Accordingly, the purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 2004 Amendment note set out under 
section 40101 of this title
] is to provide for the implementation of the Cape Town Treaty in the United States by making certain technical amendments to the provisions of chapter 441 of title 49, United States Code, directing the Federal Aviation Administration to complete the necessary rulemaking processes as expeditiously as possible, and clarifying the applicability of the Treaty during the rulemaking process.”
