42 U.S.C. 12162(e)(2)
). The evaluation shall include, for each applicable station, improvements required to bring it into compliance with the applicable parts of such section 242(e)(2), any potential barriers to achieving compliance, including issues related to passenger rail station platforms, the estimated cost of the improvements necessary, the identification of the responsible person (as defined in section 241(5) of that Act (
42 U.S.C. 12161(5)
)), and the earliest practicable date when such improvements can be made. The evaluation shall also include a detailed plan and schedule for bringing all applicable stations into compliance with the applicable parts of section 242(e)(2) by the 2010 statutory deadline for station accessibility. Amtrak shall submit the evaluation to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives; the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate; the Department of Transportation; and the National Council on Disability by 
February 1, 2009
, along with recommendations for funding the necessary improvements. Should the Department of Transportation issue any rule related to transportation for individuals with disabilities by intercity passenger rail after Amtrak submits its evaluation, Amtrak shall, within 120 days after the date that such rule is published, submit to the above parties a supplemental evaluation on any impact of the rule on its cost and schedule for achieving full compliance.


“(b)
 
Accessibility Improvements and Barrier Removal for People With Disabilities
.—
There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary [of Transportation] for the use of Amtrak such sums as may be necessary to improve the accessibility of facilities, including rail platforms, and services.”


 Use of facilities and providing services to Amtrak
(a)
 
General Authority
.—
(1)
 Amtrak may make an agreement with a rail carrier or regional transportation authority to use facilities of, and have services provided by, the carrier or authority under terms on which the parties agree. The terms shall include a penalty for untimely performance.




(2)
(A)
 If the parties cannot agree and if the Surface Transportation Board finds it necessary to carry out this part, the Board shall—
(i)
 order that the facilities be made available and the services provided to Amtrak; and




(ii)
 prescribe reasonable terms and compensation for using the facilities and providing the services.






(B)
 When prescribing reasonable compensation under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the Board shall consider quality of service as a major factor when determining whether, and the extent to which, the amount of compensation shall be greater than the incremental costs of using the facilities and providing the services.




(C)
 The Board shall decide the dispute not later than 90 days after Amtrak submits the dispute to the Board.






(3)
 Amtrak’s right to use the facilities or have the services provided is conditioned on payment of the compensation. If the compensation is not paid promptly, the rail carrier or authority entitled to it may bring an action against Amtrak to recover the amount owed.




(4)
 Amtrak shall seek immediate and appropriate legal remedies to enforce its contract rights when track maintenance on a route over which Amtrak operates falls below the contractual standard.




(b)
 
Operating During Emergencies
.—
To facilitate operation by Amtrak during an emergency, the Board, on application by Amtrak, shall require a rail carrier to provide facilities immediately during the emergency. The Board then shall promptly prescribe reasonable terms, including indemnification of the carrier by Amtrak against personal injury risk to which the carrier may be exposed. The rail carrier shall provide the facilities for the duration of the emergency.


(c)
 
Preference Over Freight Transportation
.—
Except in an emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing unless the Board orders otherwise under this subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may apply to the Board for relief. If the Board, after an opportunity for a hearing under 
section 553 of title 5
, decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Board shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on reasonable terms.


(d)
 
Accelerated Speeds
.—
If a rail carrier refuses to allow accelerated speeds on trains operated by or for Amtrak, Amtrak may apply to the Board for an order requiring the carrier to allow the accelerated speeds. The Board shall decide whether accelerated speeds are unsafe or impracticable and which improvements would be required to make accelerated speeds safe and practicable. After an opportunity for a hearing, the Board shall establish the maximum allowable speeds of Amtrak trains on terms the Board decides are reasonable.


(e)
 
Additional Trains
.—
(1)
 When a rail carrier does not agree to provide, or allow Amtrak to provide, for the operation of additional trains over a rail line of the carrier, Amtrak may apply to the Board for an order requiring the carrier to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains. After a hearing on the record, the Board may order the carrier, within 60 days, to provide or allow for the operation of the requested trains on a schedule based on legally permissible operating times. However, if the Board decides not to hold a hearing, the Board, not later than 30 days after receiving the application, shall publish in the Federal Register the reasons for the decision not to hold the hearing.




(2)
 The Board shall consider—
(A)
 when conducting a hearing, whether an order would impair unreasonably freight transportation of the rail carrier, with the carrier having the burden of demonstrating that the additional trains will impair the freight transportation; and




(B)
 when establishing scheduled running times, the statutory goal of Amtrak to implement schedules that attain a system-wide average speed of at least 60 miles an hour that can be adhered to with a high degree of reliability and passenger comfort.






(3)
 Unless the parties have an agreement that establishes the compensation Amtrak will pay the carrier for additional trains provided under an order under this subsection, the Board shall decide the dispute under subsection (a) of this section.




(f)
 Passenger Train Performance and Other Standards.—
(1)
 
Investigation of substandard performance
.—
If the on-time performance of any intercity passenger train averages less than 80 percent for any 2 consecutive calendar quarters, or the service quality of intercity passenger train operations for which minimum standards are established under section 207 of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 fails to meet those standards for 2 consecutive calendar quarters, the Surface Transportation Board (referred to in this section as the “Board”) may initiate an investigation, or upon the filing of a complaint by Amtrak, an intercity passenger rail operator, a host freight railroad over which Amtrak operates, or an entity for which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service, the Board shall initiate such an investigation, to determine whether and to what extent delays or failure to achieve minimum standards are due to causes that could reasonably be addressed by a rail carrier over whose tracks the intercity passenger train operates or reasonably addressed by Amtrak or other intercity passenger rail operators. As part of its investigation, the Board has authority to review the accuracy of the train performance data and the extent to which scheduling and congestion contribute to delays. In making its determination or carrying out such an investigation, the Board shall obtain information from all parties involved and identify reasonable measures and make recommendations to improve the service, quality, and on-time performance of the train.




(2)
 
Problems caused by host rail carrier
.—
If the Board determines that delays or failures to achieve minimum standards investigated under paragraph (1) are attributable to a rail carrier’s failure to provide preference to Amtrak over freight transportation as required under subsection (c), the Board may award damages against the host rail carrier, including prescribing such other relief to Amtrak as it determines to be reasonable and appropriate pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection.




(3)
 
Damages and relief
.—
In awarding damages and prescribing other relief under this subsection the Board shall consider such factors as—
(A)
 the extent to which Amtrak suffers financial loss as a result of host rail carrier delays or failure to achieve minimum standards; and




(B)
 what reasonable measures would adequately deter future actions which may reasonably be expected to be likely to result in delays to Amtrak on the route involved.






(4)
 
Use of damages
.—
The Board shall, as it deems appropriate, order the host rail carrier to remit the damages awarded under this subsection to Amtrak or to an entity for which Amtrak operates intercity passenger rail service. Such damages shall be used for capital or operating expenditures on the routes over which delays or failures to achieve minimum standards were the result of a rail carrier’s failure to provide preference to Amtrak over freight transportation as determined in accordance with paragraph (2).

 “facility” means a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, facility, or real property related to a rail line, right of way, fixed equipment, or facility, including a signal system, passenger station and repair tracks, a station building, a platform, and a related facility, including a water, fuel, steam, electric, and air line.




(2)
 downgrading a facility means reducing a track classification as specified in the Federal Railroad Administration track safety standards or altering a facility so that the time required for rail passenger transportation to be provided over the route on which a facility is located may be increased.




(b)
 
Approval Required for Downgrading or Disposal
.—
A facility of a rail carrier or regional transportation authority that Amtrak used to provide rail passenger transportation on 
February 1, 1979
, or on 
January 1, 1997
, may be downgraded or disposed of only after approval by the Secretary of Transportation under this section.


(c)
 
Notification and Analysis
.—
(1)
 A rail carrier intending to downgrade or dispose of a facility Amtrak currently is not using to provide transportation shall notify Amtrak of its intention. If, not later than 60 days after Amtrak receives the notice, Amtrak and the carrier do not agree to retain or maintain the facility or to convey an interest in the facility to Amtrak, the carrier may apply to the Secretary for approval to downgrade or dispose of the facility.




(2)
 After a rail carrier notifies Amtrak of its intention to downgrade or dispose of a facility, Amtrak shall survey population centers with rail passenger transportation facilities to assist in preparing a valid and timely analysis of the need for the facility and shall update the survey as appropriate. Amtrak also shall maintain a system for collecting information gathered in the survey. The system shall collect the information based on geographic regions and on whether the facility would be part of a short haul or long haul route. The survey should facilitate an analysis of—
(A)
 ridership potential by ascertaining existing and changing travel patterns that would provide maximum efficient rail passenger transportation;




(B)
 the quality of transportation of competitors or likely competitors;




(C)
 the likelihood of Amtrak offering transportation at a competitive fare;




(D)
 opportunities to target advertising and fares to potential classes of riders;




(E)
 economic characteristics of rail passenger transportation related to the facility and the extent to which the characteristics are consistent with sound economic principles of short haul or long haul rail transportation; and




(F)
 the feasibility of applying effective internal cost controls to the facility and route served by the facility to improve the ratio of passenger revenue to transportation expenses (excluding maintenance of tracks, structures, and equipment and depreciation).






(d)
 
Approval of Application and Payment of Avoidable Costs
.—
(1)
 If Amtrak does not object to an application not later than 30 days after it is submitted, the Secretary shall approve the application promptly.




(2)
 If Amtrak objects to an application, the Secretary shall decide by not later than 180 days after the objection those costs the rail carrier may avoid if it does not have to retain or maintain a facility in the condition Amtrak requests. If Amtrak does not agree by not later than 60 days after the decision to pay the carrier these avoidable costs, the Secretary shall approve the application. When deciding whether to pay a carrier the avoidable costs of retaining or maintaining a facility, Amtrak shall consider—
(A)
 the potential importance of restoring rail passenger transportation on the route on which the facility is located;




(B)
 the market potential of the route;




(C)
 the availability, adequacy, and energy efficiency of an alternate rail line or alternate mode of transportation to provide passenger transportation to or near the places that would be served by the route;




(D)
 the extent to which major population centers would be served by the route;




(E)
 the extent to which providing transportation over the route would encourage the expansion of an intercity rail passenger system in the United States; and




(F)
 the possibility of increased ridership on a rail line that connects with the route.






(e)
 
Compliance With Other Obligations
.—
Downgrading or disposing of a facility under this section does not relieve a rail carrier from complying with its other common carrier or legal obligations related to the facility.


 Management accountability
(a)
 
In General
.—
Within 3 years after the date of enactment of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008, and 2 years thereafter, the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation shall complete an overall assessment of the progress made by Amtrak management and the Department of Transportation in implementing the provisions of that Act.


(b)
 
Assessment
.—
The management assessment undertaken by the Inspector General may include a review of—
(1)
 effectiveness in improving annual financial planning;




(2)
 effectiveness in implementing improved financial accounting;




(3)
 efforts to implement minimum train performance standards;




(4)
 progress maximizing revenues, minimizing Federal subsidies, and improving financial results; and




(5)
 any other aspect of Amtrak operations the Inspector General finds appropriate to review.




 Acquiring interests in property by eminent domain
(a)
 
General Authority
.—
(1)
 To the extent financial resources are available, Amtrak may acquire by eminent domain under subsection (b) of this section interests in property—
(A)
 necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, except property of a rail carrier, a State, a political subdivision of a State, or a governmental authority; or




(B)
 requested by the Secretary of Transportation in carrying out the Secretary’s duty to design and build an intermodal transportation terminal at Union Station in the District of Columbia if the Secretary assures Amtrak that the Secretary will reimburse Amtrak.






(2)
 Amtrak may exercise the power of eminent domain only if it cannot—
(A)
 acquire the interest in the property by contract; or




(B)
 agree with the owner on the purchase price for the interest.






(b)
 
Civil Actions
.—
(1)
 A civil action to acquire an interest in property by eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section must be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the property is located or, if a single piece of property is located in more than one judicial district, in any judicial district in which any piece of the property is located. An interest is condemned and taken by Amtrak for its use when a declaration of taking is filed under this subsection and an amount of money estimated in the declaration to be just compensation for the interest is deposited in the court. The declaration may be filed with the complaint in the action or at any time before judgment. The declaration must contain or be accompanied by—
(A)
 a statement of the public use for which the interest is taken;




(B)
 a description of the property sufficient to identify it;




(C)
 a statement of the interest in the property taken;




(D)
 a plan showing the interest taken; and




(E)
 a statement of the amount of money Amtrak estimates is just compensation for the interest.






(2)
 When the declaration is filed and the deposit is made under paragraph (1) of this subsection, title to the property vests in Amtrak in fee simple absolute or in the lesser interest shown in the declaration, and the right to the money vests in the person entitled to the money. When the declaration is filed, the court may decide—
(A)
 the time by which, and the terms under which, possession of the property is given to Amtrak; and




(B)
 the disposition of outstanding charges related to the property.






(3)
 After a hearing, the court shall make a finding on the amount that is just compensation for the interest in the property and enter judgment awarding that amount and interest on it. The rate of interest is 6 percent a year and is computed on the amount of the award less the amount deposited in the court from the date of taking to the date of payment.




(4)
 On application of a party, the court may order immediate payment of any part of the amount deposited in the court for the compensation to be awarded. If the award is more than the amount received, the court shall enter judgment against Amtrak for the deficiency.




(c)
 
Authority To Condemn Rail Carrier Property Interests
.—
(1)
 If Amtrak and a rail carrier cannot agree on a sale to Amtrak of an interest in property of a rail carrier necessary for intercity rail passenger transportation, Amtrak may apply to the Surface Transportation Board for an order establishing the need of Amtrak for the interest and requiring the carrier to convey the interest on reasonable terms, including just compensation. The need of Amtrak is deemed to be established, and the Board, after holding an expedited proceeding and not later than 120 days after receiving the application, shall order the interest conveyed unless the Board decides that—
(A)
 conveyance would impair significantly the ability of the carrier to carry out its obligations as a common carrier; and




(B)
 the obligations of Amtrak to provide modern, efficient, and economical rail passenger transportation can be met adequately by acquiring an interest in other property, either by sale or by exercising its right of eminent domain under subsection (a) of this section.






(2)
 If the amount of compensation is not determined by the date of the Board’s order, the order shall require, as part of the compensation, interest at 6 percent a year from the date prescribed for the conveyance until the compensation is paid.




(3)
 Amtrak subsequently may reconvey to a third party an interest conveyed to Amtrak under this subsection or prior comparable provision of law if the Board decides that the reconveyance will carry out the purposes of this part, regardless of when the proceeding was brought (including a proceeding pending before a United States court on 
November 28, 1990
).




 Labor standards
(a)
 
Prevailing Wages and Health and Safety Standards
.—
Amtrak shall ensure that laborers and mechanics employed by contractors and subcontractors in construction work financed under an agreement made under 
section 24308(a) of this title
 will be paid wages not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor under sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40. Amtrak may make such an agreement only after being assured that required labor standards will be maintained on the construction work. Health and safety standards prescribed by the Secretary under 
section 3704 of title 40
 apply to all construction work performed under such an agreement, except for construction work performed by a rail carrier.


(b)
 
Wage Rates
.—
Wage rates in a collective bargaining agreement negotiated under the Railway Labor Act (
45 U.S.C. 151
 et seq.) are deemed to comply with sections 3141–3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40.


“(b)
 Amendment of Existing Collective Bargaining Agreement.—
“(1)
 
Contracting out
.—
Any collective bargaining agreement entered into between Amtrak and an organization representing Amtrak employees before the date of enactment of this Act [
Dec. 2, 1997
] is deemed amended to include the language of 
section 24312(b) of title 49
, United States Code, as that section existed on the day before the effective date [
Dec. 2, 1997
] of the amendments made by subsection (a) [amending this section].




“(2)
 
Enforceability of amendment
.—
The amendment to any such collective bargaining agreement deemed to be made by paragraph (1) of this subsection is binding on all parties to the agreement and has the same effect as if arrived at by agreement of the parties under the Railway Labor Act [
45 U.S.C. 151
 et seq.].




“(c)
 
Contracting-out Issues To Be Included in Negotiations
.—
Proposals on the subject matter of contracting out work, other than work related to food and beverage service, which results in the layoff of an Amtrak employee—
“(1)
 shall be included in negotiations under section 6 of the Railway Labor Act (
45 U.S.C. 156
) between Amtrak and an organization representing Amtrak employees, which shall be commenced by—
“(A)
 the date on which labor agreements under negotiation on the date of enactment of this Act [
Dec. 2, 1997
] may be re-opened; or




“(B)
 
November 1, 1999
,





whichever is earlier;




“(2)
 may, at the mutual election of Amtrak and an organization representing Amtrak employees, be included in any negotiation in progress under section 6 of the Railway Labor Act (

) on the date of enactment of this Act; and




“(3)
 may not be included in any negotiation in progress under section 6 of the Railway Labor Act (
45 U.S.C. 156
) on the date of enactment of this Act, unless both Amtrak and the organization representing Amtrak employees agree to include it in the negotiation.





No contract between Amtrak and an organization representing Amtrak employees, that is under negotiation on the date of enactment of this Act, may contain a moratorium that extends more than 5 years from the date of expiration of the last moratorium.


“(d)
 
No Inference
.—
The amendment made by subsection (a)(1) [amending this section] is without prejudice to the power of Amtrak to contract out the provision of food and beverage services on board Amtrak trains or to contract out work not resulting in the layoff of Amtrak employees.”
