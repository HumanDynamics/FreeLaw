 Enforcement shall not unreasonably interfere with the ability of a shipper, carrier, broker, or other party to arrange for the alternative transportation of any cargo or passenger being transported at the time the commercial motor vehicle is immobilized. In the case of a commercial motor vehicle transporting passengers, the Secretary or authorized State official shall provide reasonable, temporary, and secure shelter and accommodations for passengers in transit.




(iii)
 The Secretary’s designee or an authorized State official carrying out motor carrier safety enforcement activities under section 31102, shall immediately notify the owner of a commercial motor vehicle of the impoundment and the opportunity for review of the impoundment. A review shall be provided in accordance with 
section 554 of title 5
, except that the review shall occur not later than 10 days after the impoundment.






(B)
 
Issuance of regulations
.—
The Secretary shall promulgate regulations on the use of impoundment or immobilization of commercial motor vehicles as a means of enforcing additional out-of-service orders issued under chapters 5, 51, 131 through 149, 311, 313, or 315 of this title, or a regulation promulgated thereunder. Regulations promulgated under this subparagraph shall include consideration of public safety, the protection of passengers and cargo, inconvenience to passengers, and the security of the commercial motor vehicle.




(C)
 
Definition
.—
In this paragraph, the term “impoundment” or “impounding” means the seizing and taking into custody of a commercial motor vehicle or the immobilizing of a commercial motor vehicle through the attachment of a locking device or other mechanical or electronic means.






“(a)
 
In General
.—
The Secretary of Transportation should ensure that motor carriers operate safely by imposing civil penalties at a level calculated to ensure prompt and sustained compliance with Federal motor carrier safety and commercial driver’s license laws.


“(b)
 
Establishment
.—
The Secretary—
“(1)
 should establish and assess minimum civil penalties for each violation of a law referred to in subsection (a); and




“(2)
 shall assess the maximum civil penalty for each violation of a law referred to in subsection (a) by any person who is found to have committed a pattern of violations of critical or acute regulations issued to carry out such a law or to have previously committed the same or a related violation of critical or acute regulations issued to carry out such a law.




“(c)
 
Extraordinary Circumstances
.—
If the Secretary determines and documents that extraordinary circumstances exist which merit the assessment of any civil penalty lower than any level established under subsection (b), the Secretary may assess such lower penalty. In cases where a person has been found to have previously committed the same or a related violation of critical or acute regulations issued to carry out a law referred to in subsection (a), extraordinary circumstances may be found to exist when the Secretary determines that repetition of such violation does not demonstrate a failure to take appropriate remedial action.
