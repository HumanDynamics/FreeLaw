(b)
 
Determining Time on Duty
.—
In determining under subsection (a) of this section the time a train employee is on or off duty, the following rules apply:

 If—
(A)
 the time spent waiting for deadhead transportation or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment to the place of final release that is not time on duty, plus

Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit communication necessary to notify an employee of an emergency situation, as defined by the Secretary.

The number of hours established by this chapter that an employee may be required or allowed to be on duty is the maximum number of hours consistent with safety. Shorter hours of service and time on duty of an employee are proper subjects for collective bargaining between a railroad carrier and its employees.
 Pilot projects
(a)
 
In General
.—
As of the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, a railroad carrier or railroad carriers and all nonprofit employee labor organizations representing any class or craft of directly affected covered service employees of the railroad carrier or railroad carriers, may jointly petition the Secretary of Transportation for approval of—
(1)
 a waiver of compliance with this chapter as in effect on the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008; or




(2)
 a waiver of compliance with this chapter as it will be effective 9 months after the enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008,





to enable the establishment of one or more pilot projects to demonstrate the possible benefits of implementing alternatives to the strict application of the requirements of this chapter, including requirements concerning maximum on-duty and minimum off-duty periods.


(b)
 
Granting of Waivers

(1)
 explains and analyzes the effectiveness of any pilot project established pursuant to a waiver granted under subsection (a);




(2)
 describes the status of all other waivers granted under subsection (a) and their related pilot projects, if any; and




(3)
 recommends any appropriate legislative changes to this chapter.

 Regulatory authority
(a)
 
In General
.—
In order to improve safety and reduce employee fatigue, the Secretary may prescribe regulations—
(1)
 to reduce the maximum hours an employee may be required or allowed to go or remain on duty to a level less than the level established under this chapter;




(2)
 to increase the minimum hours an employee may be required or allowed to rest to a level greater than the level established under this chapter;




(3)
 to limit or eliminate the amount of time an employee spends waiting for deadhead transportation or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment to the place of final release that is considered neither on duty nor off duty under this chapter;




(4)
 for signal employees—
(A)
 to limit or eliminate the amount of time that is considered to be neither on duty nor off duty under this chapter that an employee spends returning from an outlying worksite after scheduled duty hours or returning from a trouble call to the employee’s headquarters or directly to the employee’s residence; and




(B)
 to increase the amount of time that constitutes a release period, that does not break the continuity of service and is considered time off duty; and






(5)
 to require other changes to railroad operating and scheduling practices, including unscheduled duty calls, that could affect employee fatigue and railroad safety.




(b)
 
Regulations Governing the Hours of Service of Train Employees of Commuter and Intercity Passenger Railroad Carriers
.—
Within 3 years after the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations and issue orders to establish hours of service requirements for train employees engaged in commuter rail passenger transportation and intercity rail passenger transportation (as defined in 
section 24102 of this title
) that may differ from the requirements of this chapter. Such regulations and orders may address railroad operating and scheduling practices, including unscheduled duty calls, communications during time off duty, and time spent waiting for deadhead transportation or in deadhead transportation from a duty assignment to the place of final release, that could affect employee fatigue and railroad safety.


(c)
 
Considerations
.—
In issuing regulations under subsection (a) the Secretary shall consider scientific and medical research related to fatigue and fatigue abatement, railroad scheduling and operating practices that improve safety or reduce employee fatigue, a railroad’s use of new or novel technology intended to reduce or eliminate human error, the variations in freight and passenger railroad scheduling practices and operating conditions, the variations in duties and operating conditions for employees subject to this chapter, a railroad’s required or voluntary use of fatigue management plans covering employees subject to this chapter, and any other relevant factors.


(d)
 Time Limits.—
(1)
 If the Secretary determines that regulations are necessary under subsection (a), the Secretary shall first request that the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee develop proposed regulations and, if the Committee accepts the task, provide the Committee with a reasonable time period in which to complete the task.




(2)
 If the Secretary requests that the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee accept the task of developing regulations under subsection (b) and the Committee accepts the task, the Committee shall reach consensus on the rulemaking within 18 months after accepting the task. If the Committee does not reach consensus within 18 months after the Secretary makes the request, the Secretary shall prescribe appropriate regulations within 18 months.




(3)
 If the Secretary does not request that the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee accept the task of developing regulations under subsection (b), the Secretary shall prescribe regulations within 3 years after the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008.




(e)
 Pilot Projects.—
(1)
 
In general
.—
Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Secretary shall conduct at least 2 pilot projects of sufficient size and scope to analyze specific practices which may be used to reduce fatigue for train and engine and other railroad employees as follows:
(A)
 A pilot project at a railroad or railroad facility to evaluate the efficacy of communicating to employees notice of their assigned shift time 10 hours prior to the beginning of their assigned shift as a method for reducing employee fatigue.




(B)
 A pilot project at a railroad or railroad facility to evaluate the efficacy of requiring railroads who use employee scheduling practices that subject employees to periods of unscheduled duty calls to assign employees to defined or specific unscheduled call shifts that are followed by shifts not subject to call, as a method for reducing employee fatigue.






(2)
 
Waiver
.—
The Secretary may temporarily waive the requirements of this section, if necessary, to complete a pilot project under this subsection.




(f)
 
Duty Call Defined
.—
In this section the term “duty call” means a telephone call that a railroad places to an employee to notify the employee of his or her assigned shift time.
