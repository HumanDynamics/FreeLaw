(a)
 
Liability of Consignee

Liability for payment of rates for transportation for a shipment of property by a shipper or consignor to a consignee other than the shipper or consignor, is determined under this section when the transportation is provided by motor carrier under this part. When the shipper or consignor instructs the carrier transporting the property to deliver it to a consignee that is an agent only, not having beneficial title to the property, the consignee is liable for rates billed at the time of delivery for which the consignee is otherwise liable, but not for additional rates that may be found to be due after delivery if the consignee gives written notice to the delivering carrier before delivery of the property—
(1)
 of the agency and absence of beneficial title; and




(2)
 of the name and address of the beneficial owner of the property if it is reconsigned or diverted to a place other than the place specified in the original bill of lading.




(b)
 
Liability of Beneficial Owner
.—
When the consignee is liable only for rates billed at the time of delivery under subsection (a), the shipper or consignor, or, if the property is reconsigned or diverted, the beneficial owner is liable for those additional rates regardless of the bill of the lading or contract under which the property was transported. The beneficial owner is liable for all rates when the property is reconsigned or diverted by an agent but is refused or abandoned at its ultimate destination if the agent gave the carrier in the reconsignment or diversion order a notice of agency and the name and address of the beneficial owner. A consignee giving the carrier erroneous information about the identity of the beneficial owner of the property is liable for the additional rates.


 Payment of rates
(a)
 
Transfer of Possession Upon Payment
.—
Except as provided in subsection (b), a carrier providing transportation or service subject to jurisdiction under this part shall give up possession at the destination of the property transported by it only when payment for the transportation or service is made.


(b)
 Exceptions.—
(1)
 
Regulations
.—
Under regulations of the Secretary governing the payment for transportation and service and preventing discrimination, those carriers may give up possession at destination of property transported by them before payment for the transportation or service. The regulations of the Secretary may provide for weekly or monthly payment for transportation provided by motor carriers and for periodic payment for transportation provided by water carriers.




(2)
 
Extensions of credit to governmental entities
.—
Such a carrier (including a motor carrier being used by a household goods freight forwarder) may extend credit for transporting property for the United States Government, a State, a territory or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of any of them.




(3)
 Shipments of household goods.—
(A)
 
In general
.—
A carrier providing transportation of a shipment of household goods shall give up possession of the household goods being transported at the destination upon payment of—
(i)
 100 percent of the charges contained in a binding estimate provided by the carrier;




(ii)
 not more than 110 percent of the charges contained in a nonbinding estimate provided by the carrier; or




(iii)
 in the case of a partial delivery of the shipment, the prorated percentage of the charges calculated in accordance with subparagraph (B).






(B)
 
Calculation of prorated charges
.—
For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), the prorated percentage of the charges shall be the percentage of the total charges due to the carrier as described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) that is equal to the percentage of the weight of that portion of the shipment delivered to the total weight of the shipment.




(C)
 
Post-contract services
.—
Subparagraph (A) does not apply to additional services requested by a shipper after the contract of service is executed that were not included in the estimate.




(D)
 
Impracticable operations
.—
Subparagraph (A) does not apply to impracticable operations, as defined by the applicable carrier tariff, except that the charges collected at delivery for such operations shall not exceed 15 percent of all other charges due at delivery. Any remaining charges due shall be paid within 30 days after the carrier presents its freight bill.






 Billing and collecting practices
(a)
 
Disclosure
.—
A motor carrier subject to jurisdiction under subchapter I of chapter 135 shall disclose, when a document is presented or electronically transmitted for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier for payment or agent of such responsible person, the actual rates, charges, or allowances for any transportation service and shall also disclose, at such time, whether and to whom any allowance or reduction in charges is made.


(b)
 
False or Misleading Information
.—
No person may cause a motor carrier to present false or misleading information on a document about the actual rate, charge, or allowance to any party to the transaction.


(c)
 
Allowances for Services
.—
When the actual rate, charge, or allowance is dependent upon the performance of a service by a party to the transportation arrangement, such as tendering a volume of freight over a stated period of time, the motor carrier shall indicate in any document presented for payment to the person responsible directly to the motor carrier that a reduction, allowance, or other adjustment may apply.


 Procedures for resolving claims involving unfiled, negotiated transportation rates
(a)
 Transportation Provided at Rates Other Than Legal Tariff Rates.—
(1)
