“(2)
 evaluate the Department’s policy and actions to permit certain insulin treated diabetes mellitus individuals who meet selection criteria and who successfully comply with the approved monitoring protocol to operate in other modes of transportation;




“(3)
 assess the possible legal consequences of permitting insulin treated diabetes mellitus individuals to drive commercial motor vehicles in interstate commerce;




“(4)
 analyze available data on the safety performance of diabetic drivers of motor vehicles;




“(5)
 assess the relevance of intrastate driving and experiences of other modes of transportation to interstate commercial motor vehicle operations; and




“(6)
 consult with interested groups knowledgeable about diabetes and related issues.




“(c)
 
Report to Congress
