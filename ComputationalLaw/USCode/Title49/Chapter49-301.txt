 The Secretary may act under this subsection on finding that—
(A)
 an exemption is consistent with the public interest and this chapter or chapter 325 of this title (as applicable); and




(B)
(i)
 compliance with the standard would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer that has tried to comply with the standard in good faith;




(ii)
 the exemption would make easier the development or field evaluation of a new motor vehicle safety feature providing a safety level at least equal to the safety level of the standard;




(iii)
 the exemption would make the development or field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle easier and would not unreasonably lower the safety level of that vehicle; or

(b)
 
Maintaining Purchaser Records and Procedures
.—

The Secretary may prescribe by regulation the records to be maintained and reasonable procedures for maintaining the records under this subsection, including procedures to be followed by distributors and dealers to assist the manufacturer in obtaining the information required by this subsection. A procedure shall be reasonable for the type of vehicle or tire involved, and shall provide reasonable assurance that a customer list of a distributor or dealer, or similar information, will be made available to a person (except the distributor or dealer) only when necessary to carry out this subsection and sections 30118–30121, 30166(f), and 30167(a) and (b) of this title. Availability of assistance from a distributor or dealer does not affect an obligation of a manufacturer under this subsection.

The manufacturer shall give sufficient copies of forms to distributors and dealers.






(3)
(A)
 The Secretary shall evaluate from time to time how successful the procedures under paragraph (2) of this subsection have been in helping to maintain records about first purchasers of tires. After each evaluation, the Secretary shall decide—
(i)
 the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures;




(ii)
 the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires; and




(iii)
 whether to prescribe for manufacturers, distributors, or dealers other requirements that the Secretary decides will increase significantly the percentage of first purchasers of tires about whom records are maintained.






(B)
 The Secretary may prescribe a requirement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph only if the Secretary decides it is necessary to reduce the risk to motor vehicle safety, after considering—
(i)
 the cost of the requirement to manufacturers and the burden of the requirement on distributors and dealers, compared to the increase in the percentage of first purchasers of tires about whom records would be maintained as a result of the requirement;




(ii)
 the extent to which distributors and dealers have complied with the procedures in paragraph (2) of this subsection; and




(iii)
 the extent to which distributors and dealers have encouraged first purchasers of tires to register the tires.

 Remedies for defects and noncompliance
(a)
 
Ways To Remedy
.—
(1)
 Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, when notification of a defect or noncompliance is required under section 30118(b) or (c) of this title, the manufacturer of the defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment shall remedy the defect or noncompliance without charge when the vehicle or equipment is presented for remedy. Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the manufacturer shall remedy the defect or noncompliance in any of the following ways the manufacturer chooses:
(A)
 if a vehicle—
(i)
 by repairing the vehicle;




(ii)
 by replacing the vehicle with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle; or




(iii)
 by refunding the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.






(B)
 if replacement equipment, by repairing the equipment, replacing the equipment with identical or reasonably equivalent equipment, or by refunding the purchase price.






(2)
 The Secretary of Transportation may prescribe regulations to allow the manufacturer to impose conditions on the replacement of a motor vehicle or refund of its price.




(b)
 
Tire Remedies
.—
(1)
 A manufacturer of a tire, including an original equipment tire, shall remedy a defective or noncomplying tire if the owner or purchaser presents the tire for remedy not later than 60 days after the later of—
(A)
 the day the owner or purchaser receives notification under 
section 30119 of this title
; or




(B)
 if the manufacturer decides to replace the tire, the day the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement is available.






(2)
 If the manufacturer decides to replace the tire and the replacement is not available during the 60-day period, the owner or purchaser must present the tire for remedy during a subsequent 60-day period that begins only after the owner or purchaser receives notification that a replacement will be available during the subsequent period. If tires are available during the subsequent period, only a tire presented for remedy during that period must be remedied.




(c)
 
Adequacy of Repairs
.—
(1)
 If a manufacturer decides to repair a defective or noncomplying motor vehicle or replacement equipment and the repair is not done adequately within a reasonable time, the manufacturer shall—
(A)
 replace the vehicle or equipment without charge with an identical or reasonably equivalent vehicle or equipment; or




(B)
 for a vehicle, refund the purchase price, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation.






(2)
 Failure to repair a motor vehicle or replacement equipment adequately not later than 60 days after its presentation is prima facie evidence of failure to repair within a reasonable time. However, the Secretary may extend, by order, the 60-day period if good cause for an extension is shown and the reason is published in the Federal Register before the period ends. Presentation of a vehicle or equipment for repair before the date specified by a manufacturer in a notice under section 30119(a)(5) or 30121(c)(2) of this title is not a presentation under this subsection.




(3)
 If the Secretary determines that a manufacturer’s remedy program is not likely to be capable of completion within a reasonable time, the Secretary may require the manufacturer to accelerate the remedy program if the Secretary finds—
(A)
 that there is a risk of serious injury or death if the remedy program is not accelerated; and




(B)
 that acceleration of the remedy program can be reasonably achieved by expanding the sources of replacement parts, expanding the number of authorized repair facilities, or both.





The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.




(d)
 
Filing Manufacturer’s Remedy Program
.—
A manufacturer shall file with the Secretary a copy of the manufacturer’s program under this section for remedying a defect or noncompliance. The Secretary shall make the program available to the public and publish a notice of availability in the Federal Register. A manufacturer’s remedy program shall include a plan for reimbursing an owner or purchaser who incurred the cost of the remedy within a reasonable time in advance of the manufacturer’s notification under subsection (b) or (c) of section 30118. The Secretary may prescribe regulations establishing what constitutes a reasonable time for purposes of the preceding sentence and other reasonable conditions for the reimbursement plan.
