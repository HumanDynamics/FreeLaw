 See References in Text note below.
 of this title and other information the Attorney General develops after providing notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that applying the standard prescribed in subsection (a) to the remaining lines of passenger motor vehicles (except light duty trucks) not covered by that standard would not substantially inhibit chop shop operations and motor vehicle thefts. The Attorney General also shall consider and include in the record additional costs, effectiveness, competition, and available alternative factors. The Attorney General shall submit to the Secretary the finding and record on which the finding is based.


(d)
 
Long Range Review of Effectiveness
.—
(1)
 Not later than 
December 31, 1999
, the Attorney General shall make separate findings, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, on the following:
(A)
 whether the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this subsection, or both, have been effective in substantially inhibiting the operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft.




(B)
 whether the anti-theft devices for which the Secretary has granted exemptions under 
section 33106 of this title
 are an effective substitute for parts marking in substantially inhibiting motor vehicle theft.






(2)
(A)
 In making the finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the Attorney General shall—
(i)
 consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives;




(ii)
 base that finding on information collected and analyzed under section 33112 
1
 of this title;




(iii)
 consider the effectiveness, the extent of use, and the extent to which civil and criminal penalties under 
section 33115(b) of this title
 and 
section 2322 of title 18
 on chop shops have been effective in substantially inhibiting operation of chop shops and motor vehicle theft;




(iv)
 base that finding on the 3-year and 5-year reports issued by the Secretary under 
section 33113 of this title
; and




(v)
 base that finding on other information the Attorney General develops and includes in the public record.






(B)
 The Attorney General shall submit a finding under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection promptly to the Secretary. If the Attorney General finds that the application of the standard under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, or both, has not been effective, the Secretary shall issue, not later than 180 days after receiving that finding, an order terminating the standard the Attorney General found was ineffective. The termination is effective for the model year beginning after the order is issued.






(3)
 In making a finding under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the Secretary shall consider the additional cost, competition, and available alternatives. If the Attorney General finds that the anti-theft devices are an effective substitute, the Secretary shall continue to grant exemptions under 
section 33106 of this title
 for the model years after model year 2000 at one of the following levels that the Attorney General decides: at the level authorized before 
October 25, 1992

Designation, Nonapplication, Selection, and Procedures
.—
(1)
 For purposes of the standard under 
section 33102 of this title
, the following are high theft lines:
(A)
 a passenger motor vehicle line determined under subsection (b) of this section to have had a new passenger motor vehicle theft rate in the 2-year period covering calendar years 1990 and 1991 greater than the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts in that 2-year period.




(B)
 a passenger motor vehicle line initially introduced into commerce in the United States after 
December 31, 1989
, that is selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as likely to have a theft rate greater than the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph.




(C)
 subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a passenger motor vehicle line having (for existing lines) or likely to have (for new lines) a theft rate below the median theft rate referred to in clause (A) of this paragraph, if the major parts in the vehicles are selected under paragraph (3) of this subsection as interchangeable with the majority of the major parts that are subject to the standard and are contained in the motor vehicles of a line described in clause (A) or (B) of this paragraph.






(2)
 The standard may not apply to any major part of a line described in paragraph (1)(C) of this subsection if all the passenger motor vehicles of lines that are, or are likely to be, below the median theft rate, and that contain parts interchangeable with the major parts of the line involved, account (for existing lines), or the Secretary of Transportation determines they are likely to account (for new lines), for more than 90 percent of the total annual production of all lines of that manufacturer containing those interchangeable parts.




(3)
 The lines, and the major parts of the passenger motor vehicles in those lines, that are to be subject to the standard may be selected by agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary. If the manufacturer and the Secretary disagree on the selection, the Secretary shall select the lines and parts, after notice to the manufacturer and opportunity for written comment, and subject to the confidentiality requirements of this chapter.




(4)
 To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary shall prescribe reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a selection under paragraph (3) of this subsection is made at least 6 months before the first applicable model year beginning after the selection.

Determining Theft Rate for Passenger Vehicles
.—
(1)
 In this subsection, “new passenger motor vehicle thefts”, when used in reference to a calendar year, means thefts in the United States in that year of passenger motor vehicles with the same model-year designation as that calendar year.




(2)
 Under subsection (a) of this section, the theft rate for passenger motor vehicles of a line shall be determined by a fraction—
(A)
 the numerator of which is the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line during the 2-year period referred to in subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and




(B)
 the denominator of which is the sum of the respective production volumes of all passenger motor vehicles of that line (as reported to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under chapter 329 of this title) that are of model years 1990 and 1991 and are distributed for sale in commerce in the United States.






(3)
 Under subsection (a) of this section, the median theft rate for all new passenger motor vehicle thefts during that 2-year period is the theft rate midway between the highest and the lowest theft rates determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection. If there is an even number of theft rates determined under paragraph (2), the median theft rate is the arithmetic average of the 2 adjoining theft rates midway between the highest and the lowest of those theft rates.




(4)
 In consultation with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary periodically shall obtain from the most reliable source accurate and timely theft and recovery information and publish the information for review and comment. To the greatest extent possible, the Secretary shall use theft information reported by United States Government, State, and local police. After publication and opportunity for comment, the Secretary shall use the theft information to determine the median theft rate under this subsection. The Secretary and the Director shall take any necessary actions to improve the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of the information, including ensuring that vehicles represented as stolen are really stolen.




(5)
 The Secretary periodically (but not more often than once every 2 years) may redetermine and prescribe by regulation the median theft rate under this subsection.




(c)
 
Providing Information
.—
The Secretary by regulation shall require each manufacturer to provide information necessary to select under subsection (a)(3) of this section the high theft lines and the major parts to be subject to the standard.
