Findings
.—
The Congress finds the following:
“(1)
 The Great Lakes are home to more than 400 lighthouses. One hundred and twenty of these maritime landmarks are in the State of Michigan.




“(2)
 Lighthouses are an important part of Great Lakes culture and stand as a testament to the importance of shipping in the region’s political, economic, and social history.




“(3)
 Advances in navigation technology have made many Great Lakes lighthouses obsolete. In Michigan alone, approximately 70 lighthouses will be designated as excess property of the Federal Government and will be transferred to the General Services Administration for disposal.




“(4)
 Unfortunately, the Federal property disposal process is confusing, complicated, and not well-suited to disposal of historic lighthouses or to facilitate transfers to nonprofit organizations. This is especially troubling because, in many cases, local nonprofit historical organizations have dedicated tremendous resources to preserving and maintaining Great Lakes lighthouses.




“(5)
 If Great Lakes lighthouses disappear, the public will be unaware of an important chapter in Great Lakes history.




“(6)
 The National Trust for Historic Preservation has placed Michigan lighthouses on their list of Most Endangered Historic Places.




“(b)
 
Assistance for Great Lakes Lighthouse Preservation Efforts

 The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating may authorize a person providing commercial VHF communications services to place commercial VHF communications equipment on real property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard (including towers) subject to any terms agreed to by the parties. The Secretary and that commercial VHF communications service provider also may enter into an agreement providing for VHF communications services to the Coast Guard (including digital selective calling and radio direction finding services) at a discounted rate or price based on providing such access to real property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard.


“(b)
 Commercial VHF communication equipment placed on real property under the administrative control of the Coast Guard under this section shall not interfere in any manner with any current or future Coast Guard communication equipment.


“(c)
 Nothing in this section shall affect the rights or obligations of the United States under section 704(c) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 [
Pub. L. 104–104
] (
47 U.S.C. 332
 note) with respect to the availability of property or under section 359(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (

“(2)
 commissioned, warrant, and petty officers of the Coast Guard to serve as administrators and instructors; and
