Chapter 54
HUMAN CAPITAL PERFORMANCE FUND
 Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to promote, through the creation of a Human Capital Performance Fund, greater performance in the Federal Government. Monies from the Fund will be used to reward agencies’ highest performing and most valuable employees. This Fund will offer Federal managers a new tool to recognize employee performance that is critical to the achievement of agency missions.
