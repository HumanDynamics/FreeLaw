 a change in rate of pay under subchapter VI of chapter 53 of this title is deemed effective as of the first day of the pay period after the pay period in which the payroll change is approved; and




(2)
 a change in rate of pay under section 5344 or 5349 of this title is deemed effective as of the date of issuance of the order granting the increase or the effective date of the increase, whichever is later, except, that in the case of an employee who dies or retires during the period beginning on the effective date of the increase and ending on the date of the issuance of the order granting the increase, a change in rate of pay under either of such sections shall be deemed as having been in effect for such employee during that period.




 Death claims; order of precedence; escheat
(a)
 Except as provided in subsection (e), the amount of group life insurance and group accidental death insurance in force on an employee at the date of his death shall be paid, on the establishment of a valid claim, to the person or persons surviving at the date of his death, in the following order of precedence:
First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee in a signed and witnessed writing received before death in the employing office or, if insured because of receipt of annuity or of benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title as provided by 
section 8706(b) of this title
, in the Office of Personnel Management. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.


Second, if there is no designated beneficiary, to the widow or widower of the employee.


Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of the employee and descendants of deceased children by representation.


Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of the employee or the survivor of them.


Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the employee.


Sixth, if none of the above, to other next of kin of the employee entitled under the laws of the domicile of the employee at the date of his death.




(b)
 If, within 1 year after the death of the employee, no claim for payment has been filed by a person entitled under the order of precedence named by subsection (a) of this section, or if payment to the person within that period is prohibited by Federal statute or regulation, payment may be made in the order of precedence as if the person had predeceased the employee, and the payment bars recovery by any other person.


(c)
 If, within 2 years after the death of the employee, no claim for payment has been filed by a person entitled under the order of precedence named by subsection (a) of this section, and neither the Office nor the administrative office established by the company concerned pursuant to 
section 8709(b) of this title
 has received notice that such a claim will be made, payment may be made to the claimant who in the judgment of the Office is equitably entitled thereto, and the payment bars recovery by any other person.


(d)
 If, within 4 years after the death of the employee, payment has not been made under this section and no claim for payment by a person entitled under this section is pending, the amount payable escheats to the credit of the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund.


(e)
(1)
 Any amount which would otherwise be paid to a person determined under the order of precedence named by subsection (a) shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Office to another person if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation.




(2)
 For purposes of this subsection, a decree, order, or agreement referred to in paragraph (1) shall not be effective unless it is received, before the date of the covered employee’s death, by the employing agency or, if the employee has separated from service, by the Office.




(3)
 A designation under this subsection with respect to any person may not be changed except—

 The Office shall prescribe any regulations necessary to carry out this subsection, including regulations for the application of this subsection in the event that two or more decrees, orders, or agreements, are received with respect to the same amount.




 Termination of insurance; assignment of ownership
(a)
 A policy purchased under this chapter shall contain a provision, approved by the Office of Personnel Management, to the effect that insurance on an employee stops on his separation from the service or 12 months after discontinuance of his pay, whichever is earlier, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office. Justices and judges of the United States described in section 8701(a)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this chapter are deemed to continue in active employment for purposes of this chapter.


(b)
(1)
 In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity and has been insured under this chapter throughout—
(A)
 the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of the employee’s retirement, or




(B)
 the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if fewer than 5 years,





life insurance, without accidental death and dismemberment insurance, may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office.




(2)
 In the case of any employee who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee and has been insured under this chapter throughout—
(A)
 the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date the employee becomes entitled to compensation, or




(B)
 the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if fewer than 5 years,





life insurance, without accidental death and dismemberment insurance, may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office, during the period the employee is receiving compensation and is held by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary’s delegate to be unable to return to duty.




(3)
 The amount of life insurance continued under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection shall be continued, with or without reduction, at the end of each full calendar month after the date the employee becomes 65 years of age and is retired or is receiving compensation for disease or injury, in accordance with the employee’s written election at the time eligibility to continue insurance during retirement or receipt of compensation arises, as follows:
(A)
 the employee may elect to have the deductions required by 
section 8707 of this title
 withheld from annuity or compensation, and the employee’s life insurance shall be reduced each month by 2 percent of the face value until 25 percent of the amount of life insurance in force before the first reduction remains; or




(B)
 in addition to any deductions which would be required if the insurance were continued as provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the employee may elect continuous withholdings from annuity or compensation in amounts determined by the Office, and the employee’s life insurance coverage shall be either continued without reduction or reduced each month by no more than 1 percent of its face value until no less than 50 percent of the amount of insurance in force before the first reduction remains.






(4)
 If an employee elects to continue insurance under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of this subsection at the time eligibility to continue insurance during retirement or receipt of compensation for disease or injury arises, the individual may later cancel that election and life insurance coverage shall continue as if the individual had originally elected coverage under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) of this subsection.




(c)
 Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an employee who enters on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of employees as defined by 
section 8701(a) of this title
, within 60 days after entering on that leave without pay, may elect to continue his insurance and arrange to pay currently into the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund, through his employing agency, both employee and agency contributions from the beginning of leave without pay. The employing agency shall forward the premium payments to the Fund. If the employee does not so elect, his insurance will continue during nonpay status and stop as provided by subsection (a) of this section.


(d)
(1)
 An employee who enters on approved leave without pay in the circumstances described in paragraph (2) may elect to have such employee’s life insurance continue (beyond the end of the 12 months of coverage provided for under subsection (a)) for an additional 12 months and arrange to pay currently into the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund, through such employee’s employing agency, both employee and agency contributions, from the beginning of that additional 12 months of coverage. The employing agency shall forward the premium payments to the Fund. If the employee does not so elect, such employee’s insurance will continue during nonpay status and stop as provided by subsection (a). An individual making an election under this subsection may cancel that election at any time, in which case such employee’s insurance will stop as provided by subsection (a) or upon receipt of notice of cancellation, whichever is later.

 This subsection applies in the case of any employee who—
(A)
 is a member of a reserve component of the armed forces called or ordered to active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less; and




(B)
 enters on approved leave without pay to perform active duty pursuant to such call or order.






(e)
 If the insurance of an employee stops because of separation from the service or suspension without pay, and the separation or suspension is thereafter officially found to have been erroneous, the employee is deemed to have been insured during the period of erroneous separation or suspension. Deductions otherwise required by section 8707 of this chapter shall not be withheld from any backpay awarded for the period of separation or suspension unless death or accidental dismemberment of the employee occurs during such period.


(f)
(1)
 Under regulations prescribed by the Office, each policy purchased under this chapter shall provide that an insured employee or former employee may make an irrevocable assignment of the employee’s or former employee’s incidents of ownership in the policy.




(2)
 A court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of a court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, may direct that an insured employee or former employee make an irrevocable assignment of the employee’s or former employee’s incidents of ownership in insurance under this chapter (if there is no previous assignment) to the person specified in the court order or court-approved property settlement agreement.




(g)
 If the insurance of a former employee receiving a disability annuity under 
section 8337 of this title
 stops because of the termination of such annuity, and such annuity is thereafter restored under the second or third sentence of subsection (e) of such section, such former employee may, under regulations prescribed by the Office, elect to resume the insurance coverage which was so stopped.


(h)
 The insurance of an employee under a policy purchased under section 8709 shall not be invalidated based on a finding that the employee erroneously became insured, or erroneously continued insurance upon retirement or entitlement to compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title, if such finding occurs after the erroneous insurance and applicable withholdings have been in force for 2 years during the employee’s lifetime.


“(a)
 Except as provided in subsection (b), the amendments made by this Act to 
section 8706 of title 5
, United States Code, shall apply to policies purchased by judges after the date of enactment of this Act [
July 10, 1984
].


“(b)
 If a company which issued a policy which is in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act agrees, the amendments made by this Act [probably should be ‘made by this Act to 
section 8706 of title 5
’] shall apply to such policy.”


 Employee deductions; withholding
(a)
 Subject to subsection (c)(2), during each period in which an employee is insured under a policy purchased by the Office of Personnel Management under 
section 8709 of this title
, there shall be withheld from the employee’s pay a share of the cost of the group life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance.


(b)
(1)
 Subject to subsection (c)(2), whenever life insurance continues after an employee retires on an immediate annuity or while the employee is receiving compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in 
section 8706(b) of this title
, deductions for insurance shall be withheld from the employee’s annuity or compensation, except that, in any case in which the insurance is continued as provided in 
section 8706(b)(3)(A) of this title
, the deductions shall not be made for months after the calendar month in which the employee becomes 65 years of age.




(2)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, insurance shall be so continued without cost (other than as provided under section 8706(b)(3)(B)) to each employee who so retires, or commences receiving compensation, on or before 
December 31, 1989
.




(c)
(1)
 The amount withheld from the pay, annuity, or compensation of each employee subject to insurance deductions shall be at the rate, adjusted to the nearest half-cent, of 66⅔ percent of the level cost as determined by the Office for each $1,000 of the employee’s basic insurance amount.




(2)
 An employee who is subject to withholdings under this section and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue insurance if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system that administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this section.




(d)
 If an agency fails to withhold the proper amount of life insurance deductions from an individual’s salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of unpaid deductions may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of unpaid deductions, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the sum of the uncollected deductions and related agency contributions required under 
section 8708 of this title
 to the Office for deposit to the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund.


 Government contributions
(a)
 For each period in which an employee is insured under a policy of insurance purchased by the Office of Personnel Management under

section 8707 of this title
 shall be contributed from the appropriation or fund which is used to pay him.


(b)
 When an employee is paid by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, the Chief Administrative Officer may contribute the sum required by subsection (a) of this section from the applicable accounts of the House of Representatives.


(c)
 When the employee is an elected official, the sum required by subsection (a) of this section is contributed from an appropriation or fund available for payment of other salaries of the same office or establishment.


(d)
(1)
 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, for each period in which an employee continues life insurance after retirement or while in receipt of compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided under 
section 8706(b) of this title
, a sum equal to one-half of the amount which is withheld from the employee’s annuity or compensation under 
section 8707 of this title
 shall be contributed by the Office from annual appropriations which are authorized to be made for that purpose and which may be made available until expended.




(2)
 Contributions under this subsection—

, be equal to the amount which would apply under this subsection if such individual had instead elected coverage under subparagraph (A) of such section.






(3)

 Reinsurance
(a)

(b)
 The Office shall determine for and in advance of a policy year which companies are eligible to participate as reinsurers and the amount of insurance under a policy which is to be allocated to the issuing company and to reinsurers. The Office shall make this determination at least every 3 years and when a participating company withdraws.


(c)
 The Office shall establish a formula under which the amount of insurance retained by an issuing company after ceding reinsurance, and the amount of reinsurance ceded to each reinsurer, is in proportion to the total amount of each company’s group life insurance, excluding insurance purchased under this chapter, in force in the United States on the determination date, which is the most recent December 31 for which information is available to the Office. In determining the proportions, the portion of a company’s group life insurance in force on the determination date in excess of $100,000,000 shall be reduced by—

(3)
 75 percent of the third $100,000,000 of the excess; and




(4)
 95 percent of the remaining excess.





However, the amount retained by or ceded to a company may not exceed 25 percent of the amount of the company’s total life insurance in force in the United States on the determination date.


(d)
 A fraternal benefit association which is—
(1)
 licensed to transact life insurance under the laws of a State or the District of Columbia; and




(2)
 engaged in issuing insurance certificates on the lives of employees of the United States exclusively;





is eligible to act as a reinsuring company and may be allocated an amount of reinsurance equal to 25 percent of its total life insurance in force on employees of the United States on the determination date named by subsection (c) of this section.


(e)
 An issuing company or reinsurer is entitled, as a minimum, to be allocated an amount of insurance under the policy equal to any reduction from 
December 31, 1953
, to the determination date, in the amount of the company’s group life insurance under policies issued to associations of employees of the United States. However, any increase under this subsection in the amount allocated is reduced by the amount in force on the determination date of any policy covering life insurance agreements assumed by the Office.


(f)
 The Office may modify the computations under this section as necessary to carry out the intent of this section.


 Basic tables of premium rates
(a)
 A policy purchased under this chapter shall include, for the first policy year, basic tables of premium rates as follows:
(1)
 For group life insurance, a schedule of basic premium rates by age which the Office of Personnel Management determines to be consistent with the lowest schedule of basic premium rates generally charged for new group life insurance policies issued to large employers.




(2)
 For group accidental death and dismemberment insurance, a basic premium rate which the Office determines is consistent with the lowest rate generally charged for new group accidental death and dismemberment policies issued to large employers.





The schedule for group life insurance, except as otherwise provided by this section, shall be applied to the distribution by age of the amounts of group life insurance under the policy at its date of issuance to determine an average basic premium rate per $1,000 of life insurance.


(b)
 The policy shall provide that the basic premium rates determined for the first policy year continue for later policy years except as readjusted for a later year based on experience under the policy. The company issuing the policy may make the readjustment on a basis that the Office determines in advance of the policy year is consistent with the general practice of life insurance companies under policies of group life and group accidental death and dismemberment insurance issued to large employers.


(c)
 The policy shall provide that if the Office determines that ascertaining the actual age distribution of the amounts of group life insurance in force at the date of issue of the policy or at the end of the first or any later year of insurance thereunder would not be possible except at a disproportionately high expense, the Office may approve the determination of a tentative average group life premium rate, for the first or any later policy year, instead of using the actual age distribution. The Office, on request by the company issuing the policy, shall redetermine the tentative average premium rate during any policy year, if experience indicates that the assumptions made in determining that rate were incorrect for that year.


(d)
 The policy shall stipulate the maximum expense and risk charges for the first policy year. The Office shall determine these charges on a basis consistent with the general level of charges made by life insurance companies under policies of group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance issued to large employers. The maximum charges continue from year to year, except that the Office may redetermine them for any year either by agreement with the company issuing the policy or on written notice given to the company at least 1 year before the beginning of the year for which the redetermined maximum charges will be effective.


 Annual accounting; special contingency reserve
 Effect of other statutes
Any provision of law outside of this chapter which provides coverage or any other benefit under this chapter to any individuals who (based on their being employed by an entity other than the Government) would not otherwise be eligible for any such coverage or benefit shall not apply with respect to any individual appointed, transferred, or otherwise commencing that type of employment on or after 
 Employees’ Life Insurance Fund
(a)
 The amounts withheld from employees under 
section 8707 of this title
 and the sums contributed from appropriations and funds under 
section 8708 of this title
 shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund. The Fund is available without fiscal year limitation for—
(1)
 premium payments under an insurance policy purchased under this chapter; and




(2)
 expenses incurred by the Office of Personnel Management in the administration of this chapter within the limitations that may be specified annually by appropriation acts.




(b)
 The Secretary of the Treasury may invest and reinvest any of the money in the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, and may sell these obligations for the purposes of the Fund. The interest on and the proceeds from the sale of these obligations, and the income derived from dividend or premium rate adjustments from insurers, become a part of the Fund.


(c)
(1)
 No tax, fee, or other monetary payment may be imposed or collected by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority thereof, on, or with respect to, any premium paid under an insurance policy purchased under this chapter.




(2)
 Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be construed to exempt any company issuing a policy of insurance under this chapter from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to or realized by that company from business conducted under this chapter, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.




 Optional insurance
(a)
 Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709–8712 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management, without regard to section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each insured employee equal amounts of optional life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance in addition to the amounts provided in 
section 8704(a) of this title
.


(b)
(1)
 An employee who is deployed in support of a contingency operation (as that term is defined in 
section 101(a)(13) of title 10
) or an employee of the Department of Defense who is designated as emergency essential under 
section 1580 of title 10
 shall be insured under the policy of insurance under this section if the employee, within 60 days after the date of notification of deployment or designation, elects to be insured under the policy of insurance. An election under this paragraph shall be effective when provided to the Office in writing, in the form prescribed by the Office, within such 60-day period.




(2)
 The optional life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance shall be made available to each insured employee under such conditions as the Office shall prescribe and in amounts approved by the Office but not more than the greater of $10,000 or an amount which, when added to the amount provided in 
section 8704(a) of this title
, makes the sum of his insurance equal to his annual pay.




(c)
(1)
 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the optional insurance on an employee stops on his separation from service or 12 months after discontinuance of his pay, whichever is earlier, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.




(2)
(A)
 In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity and has been insured under this section throughout—
(i)
 the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of such retirement, or




(ii)
 the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if less than 5 years,





the amount of optional life insurance only which has been in force throughout such period may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office.




(B)
 In the case of any employee who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee and has been insured under this section throughout—
(i)
 the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date such employee becomes entitled to such compensation, or




(ii)
 the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if less than 5 years,





the amount of optional life insurance only which has been in force throughout such period may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office, during the period the employee is receiving such compensation for disease or injury and is held by the Secretary of Labor or his delegate to be unable to return to duty.




(C)
 The amount of optional life insurance continued under subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be reduced by 2 percent at the end of each full calendar month after the date the employee becomes 65 years of age and is retired or is receiving compensation for disease or injury. The Office shall prescribe minimum amounts, not less than 25 percent of the amount of life insurance in force before the first reduction, to which the insurance may be reduced.






(3)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section,
1
1
 So in original. Probably should be “paragraph (1) of this subsection,”.
 a justice or judge of the United States as defined by 
section 8701(a)(5) of this title
 who resigns his office without meeting the requirements of 
section 371(a) of title 28
, United States Code, for continuation of the judicial salary shall have the right to convert regular optional life insurance coverage issued under this section during his judicial service to an individual policy of life insurance under the same conditions approved by the Office governing conversion of basic life insurance coverage for employees eligible as provided in 
section 8706(a) of this title
.




(d)
(1)
 During each period in which an employee has the optional insurance the full cost thereof shall be withheld from his pay. During each period in which an employee continues optional life insurance after retirement or while in receipt of compensation for work injuries, as provided in 
section 8706(b) of this title
, the full cost thereof shall be withheld from his annuity or compensation, except that, at the end of the calendar month in which he becomes 65 years of age, the optional life insurance shall be without cost to him. Amounts so withheld shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in 
section 8714 of this title
 and shall be reported and accounted for separately from amounts withheld and contributed under sections 8707 and 8708 of this title.




(2)
 If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of optional insurance from an individual’s salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund.




(3)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue optional insurance if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system which administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.




(e)
 The cost of the optional insurance shall be determined from time to time by the Office on the basis of such age groups as it considers appropriate.


(f)
 The amount of optional life, or life and accidental death, insurance in force on an employee at the date of his death shall be paid as provided in 
section 8705 of this title
.


 Additional optional life insurance
(a)
 Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709 through 8712 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management, without regard to section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each employee insured under 
section 8702 of this title
 amounts of additional optional life insurance (without accidental death and dismemberment insurance). An employee may elect coverage under this section without regard to whether the employee has elected coverage under optional insurance available under 
section 8714a of this title
.


(b)
(1)
 An employee who is deployed in support of a contingency operation (as that term is defined in 
section 101(a)(13) of title 10
) or an employee of the Department of Defense who is designated as emergency essential under 
section 1580 of title 10
 shall be insured under the policy of insurance under this section if the employee, within 60 days after the date of notification of deployment or designation, elects to be insured under the policy of insurance. An election under this paragraph shall be effective when provided to the Office in writing, in the form prescribed by the Office, within such 60-day period.




(2)
 The additional optional insurance provided under this section shall be made available to each eligible employee who has elected coverage under this section, under conditions the Office shall prescribe, in multiples, at the employee’s election, of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times the annual rate of basic pay payable to the employee (rounded to the next higher multiple of $1,000). An employee may reduce or stop coverage elected pursuant to this section at any time.




(c)
(1)
 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the additional optional insurance elected by an employee pursuant to this section shall stop on separation from service or 12 months after discontinuance of his pay, whichever is earlier, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office. Justices and judges of the United States described in section 8701(a)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this chapter are deemed to continue in active employment for purposes of this chapter. A justice or judge of the United States as defined by 
section 8701(a)(5) of this title
 who resigns his office without meeting the requirements of 
section 371(a) of title 28
, United States Code, for continuation of the judicial salary shall have the right to convert additional optional life insurance coverage issued under this section during his judicial service to an individual policy of life insurance under the same conditions approved by the Office governing conversion of basic life insurance coverage for employees eligible as provided in 
section 8706(a) of this title
.




(2)
 In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, so much of the additional optional insurance as has been in force for not less than—
(A)
 the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of retirement or entitlement to compensation, or




(B)
 the full period or periods of service during which the insurance was available to the employee, if fewer than 5 years,





may be continued under conditions determined by the Office after retirement or while the employee is receiving compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title and is held by the Secretary of Labor (or the Secretary’s delegate) to be unable to return to duty.




(3)
 The amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall be continued, with or without reduction, in accordance with the employee’s written election at the time eligibility to continue insurance during retirement or receipt of compensation arises, as follows:
(A)
 The employee may elect to have withholdings cease in accordance with subsection (d), in which case—
(i)
 the amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall be reduced each month by 2 percent effective at the beginning of the second calendar month after the date the employee becomes 65 years of age and is retired or is in receipt of compensation; and




(ii)
 the reduction under clause (i) shall continue for 50 months at which time the insurance shall stop.






(B)
 The employee may, instead of the option under subparagraph (A), elect to have the full cost of additional optional insurance continue to be withheld from such employee’s annuity or compensation on and after the date such withholdings would otherwise cease pursuant to an election under subparagraph (A), in which case the amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall not be reduced, subject to paragraph (4).




(C)
 An employee who does not make any election under the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be treated as if such employee had made an election under subparagraph (A).






(4)
 If an employee makes an election under paragraph (3)(B), that individual may subsequently cancel such election, in which case additional optional insurance shall be determined as if the individual had originally made an election under paragraph (3)(A).




(5)
(A)
 An employee whose additional optional insurance under this section would otherwise stop in accordance with paragraph (1) and who is not eligible to continue insurance under paragraph (2) may elect, under conditions prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to continue all or a portion of so much of the additional optional insurance as has been in force for not less than—
(i)
 the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of the event which would cause insurance to stop under paragraph (1); or




(ii)
 the full period or periods of service during which the insurance was available to the employee, if fewer than 5 years,





at group rates established for purposes of this section, in lieu of conversion to an individual policy. The amount of insurance continued under this paragraph shall be reduced by 50 percent effective at the beginning of the second calendar month after the date the employee or former employee attains age 70 and shall stop at the beginning of the second calendar month after attainment of age 80, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office. Alternatively, insurance continued under this paragraph may be reduced or stopped at any time the employee or former employee elects.




(B)
 When an employee or former employee elects to continue additional optional insurance under this paragraph following separation from service or 12 months without pay, the insured individual shall submit timely payment of the full cost thereof, plus any amount the Office determines necessary to cover associated administrative expenses, in such manner as the Office shall prescribe by regulation. Amounts required under this subparagraph shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided under section 8714 and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under section 8714a(d).




(C)
(i)
 Subject to clause (ii), no election to continue additional optional insurance may be made under this paragraph 3 years after the effective date of this paragraph.




(ii)
 On and after the date on which an election may not be made under clause (i), all additional optional insurance under this paragraph for former employees shall terminate, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.








(d)
(1)
 During each period in which the additional optional insurance is in force on an employee the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the employee’s pay. During each period in which an employee continues additional optional insurance after retirement or while in receipt of compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the former employee’s annuity or compensation, except that, if insurance is continued as provided under subsection (c)(3)(A), beginning at the end of the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age, the additional optional life insurance shall be without cost to the former employee. Amounts so withheld (and any amounts withheld as provided in subsection (c)(3)(B)) shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in 
section 8714 of this title
 and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under 
section 8714a(d) of this title
.




(2)
 If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of additional optional insurance from an individual’s salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund.




(3)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue additional optional insurance if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system which administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.




(e)
 The cost of the additional optional insurance shall be determined from time to time by the Office on the basis of the employee’s age relative to such age groups as the Office establishes under 
section 8714a(e) of this title
.


(f)
 The amount of additional optional life insurance in force on an employee at the date of his death shall be paid as provided in 
section 8705 of this title
.


 Optional life insurance on family members
(a)
 Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709 through 8712 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management, without regard to section 6101(b) to (d) of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each employee insured under 
section 8702 of this title
 amounts of optional life insurance (without accidental death and dismemberment insurance) on the employee’s family members.


(b)
(1)
 The optional life insurance on family members provided under this section shall be made available to each eligible employee who has elected coverage under this section, under conditions the Office shall prescribe, in multiples, at the employee’s election, of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times—

 $5,000 for a spouse; and




(B)
 $2,500 for each child described under section 8701(d).

(c)
(1)
 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the optional life insurance on family members shall stop at the earlier of the employee’s death, the employee’s separation from the service, or 12 months after discontinuance of pay, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to individual policies of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.




(2)
 In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee and who has had in force insurance under this section for no less than—

 the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of retirement or entitlement to compensation, or

optional life insurance on family members may be continued under the same conditions as provided in section 8714b(c)(2) through (4).




(d)
(1)
 During each period in which the optional life insurance on family members is in force the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the employee’s pay. During each period in which an employee continues optional life insurance on family members after retirement or while in receipt of compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the full cost shall be withheld from the annuity or compensation, except that, beginning at the end of the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age, the optional life insurance on family members shall be without cost to the employee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the full cost shall be continued after the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age if, and for so long as, an election under this section corresponding to that described in section 8714b(c)(3)(B) remains in effect with respect to such former employee. Amounts so withheld shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in 
section 8714 of this title
 and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under 
section 8714a(d) of this title
.




(2)
 If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of optional life insurance on family members from an individual’s salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund.




(3)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue optional life insurance on family members if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees’ Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system that administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.




(e)
 The cost of the optional life insurance on family members shall be determined from time to time by the Office on the basis of the employee’s age relative to such age groups as the Office establishes under 
section 8714a(e) of this title
.

section 8705 of this title
.


 Option to receive “living benefits”
(a)
 For the purpose of this section, an individual shall be considered to be “terminally ill” if such individual has a medical prognosis that such individual’s life expectancy is 9 months or less.


(b)
 The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which any individual covered by group life insurance under section 8704(a) may, if such individual is terminally ill, elect to receive a lump-sum payment equal to—
(1)
 the full amount of insurance under section 8704(a) (or portion thereof designated for this purpose under subsection (d)(4)) which would otherwise be payable under this chapter (on the establishment of a valid claim)—
(A)
 computed based on a date determined under regulations of the Office (but not later than 30 days after the date on which the individual’s application for benefits under this section is approved or deemed approved under subsection (d)(3)); and




(B)
 assuming continued coverage under this chapter at that time;





reduced by




(2)
 an amount necessary to assure that there is no increase in the actuarial value of the benefit paid (as determined under regulations of the Office).




(c)
(1)
 If a lump-sum payment is taken under this section—
(A)
 no insurance under the provisions of section 8704(a) or (b) shall be payable based on the death or any loss of the individual involved, unless the lump-sum payment represents only a portion of the total benefits which could have been taken, in which case benefits under those provisions shall remain in effect, except that the basic insurance amount on which they are based—
(i)
 shall be reduced by the percentage which the designated portion comprised relative to the total benefits which could have been taken (rounding the result to the nearest multiple of $1,000 or, if midway between multiples of $1,000, to the next higher multiple of $1,000); and




(ii)
 shall not be subject to further adjustment; and






(B)
 deductions and withholdings under section 8707, and contributions under section 8708, shall be terminated with respect to such individual (or reduced in a manner consistent with the percentage reduction in the individual’s basic insurance amount, if applicable), effective with respect to any amounts which would otherwise become due on or after the date of payment under this section.






(2)
 An individual who takes a lump-sum payment under this section (whether full or partial) remains eligible for optional benefits under sections 8714a–8714c (subject to payment of the full cost of those benefits in accordance with applicable provisions of the section or sections involved, to the same extent as if no election under this section had been made).




(d)
(1)
 The Office’s regulations shall include provisions regarding the form and manner in which an application under this section shall be made and the procedures in accordance with which any such application shall be considered.




(2)
 An application shall not be considered to be complete unless it includes such information and supporting evidence as the regulations require, including certification by an appropriate medical authority as to the nature of the individual’s illness and that the individual is not expected to live more than 9 months because of that illness.




(3)
(A)
 In order to ascertain the reliability of any medical opinion or finding submitted as part of an application under this section, the covered individual may be required to submit to a medical examination under the direction of the agency or entity considering the application. The individual shall not be liable for the costs associated with any examination required under this subparagraph.




(B)
 Any decision by the reviewing agency or entity with respect to an application for benefits under this section (including one relating to an individual’s medical prognosis) shall not be subject to administrative review.






(4)
(A)
 An individual making an election under this section may designate that only a limited portion (expressed as a multiple of $1,000) of the total amount otherwise allowable under this section be paid pursuant to such election.




(B)
 A designation under this paragraph may not be made by an individual described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 8706(b).






(5)
 An election to receive benefits under this section shall be irrevocable, and not more than one such election may be made by any individual.
