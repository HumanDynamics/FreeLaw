Chapter 71
LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS

(a)
 The Congress finds that—
(1)
 experience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations of their own choosing in decisions which affect them—

 safeguards the public interest,

 contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and

 facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment; and






(2)
 the public interest demands the highest standards of employee performance and the continued development and implementation of modern and progressive work practices to facilitate and improve employee performance and the efficient accomplishment of the operations of the Government.





Therefore, labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest.


(b)
 It is the purpose of this chapter to prescribe certain rights and obligations of the employees of the Federal Government and to establish procedures which are designed to meet the special requirements and needs of the Government. The provisions of this chapter should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government.

(b)
 A unit shall not be determined to be appropriate under this section solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized, nor shall a unit be determined to be appropriate if it includes—

 to enforce any rule or regulation (other than a rule or regulation implementing 
section 2302 of this title
) which is in conflict with any applicable collective bargaining agreement if the agreement was in effect before the date the rule or regulation was prescribed; or




(8)
 to otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this chapter.




(b)
 For the purpose of this chapter, it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization—
(1)
 to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this chapter;




(2)
 to cause or attempt to cause an agency to discriminate against any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this chapter;




(3)
 to coerce, discipline, fine, or attempt to coerce a member of the labor organization as punishment, reprisal, or for the purpose of hindering or impeding the member’s work performance or productivity as an employee or the discharge of the member’s duties as an employee;




(4)
 to discriminate against an employee with regard to the terms or conditions of membership in the labor organization on the basis of race, color, creed, national origin, sex, age, preferential or nonpreferential civil service status, political affiliation, marital status, or handicapping condition;




(5)
 to refuse to consult or negotiate in good faith with an agency as required by this chapter;

(B)
 to condone any activity described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by failing to take action to prevent or stop such activity; or






(8)
 to otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this chapter.





Nothing in paragraph (7) of this subsection shall result in any informational picketing which does not interfere with an agency’s operations being considered as an unfair labor practice.


(c)
 For the purpose of this chapter it shall be an unfair labor practice for an exclusive representative to deny membership to any employee in the appropriate unit represented by such exclusive representative except for failure—
(1)
 to meet reasonable occupational standards uniformly required for admission, or




(2)
 to tender dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring and retaining membership.





This subsection does not preclude any labor organization from enforcing discipline in accordance with procedures under its constitution or bylaws to the extent consistent with the provisions of this chapter.


(d)
 Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section. Except for matters wherein, under section 7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.


(e)
 The expression of any personal view, argument, opinion or the making of any statement which—
(1)
 publicizes the fact of a representational election and encourages employees to exercise their right to vote in such election,




(2)
 corrects the record with respect to any false or misleading statement made by any person, or




(3)
 informs employees of the Government’s policy relating to labor-management relations and representation,





shall not, if the expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit or was not made under coercive conditions, (A) constitute an unfair labor practice under any provision of this chapter, or (B) constitute grounds for the setting aside of any election conducted under any provisions of this chapter.


 Duty to bargain in good faith; compelling need; duty to consult
(a)
(1)
 Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the duty to bargain in good faith shall, to the extent not inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation, extend to matters which are the subject of any rule or regulation only if the rule or regulation is not a Government-wide rule or regulation.




(2)
 The duty to bargain in good faith shall, to the extent not inconsistent with Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation, extend to matters which are the subject of any agency rule or regulation referred to in paragraph (3) of this subsection only if the Authority has determined under subsection (b) of this section that no compelling need (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Authority) exists for the rule or regulation.




(3)
 Paragraph (2) of the subsection applies to any rule or regulation issued by any agency or issued by any primary national subdivision of such agency, unless an exclusive representative represents an appropriate unit including not less than a majority of the employees in the issuing agency or primary national subdivision, as the case may be, to whom the rule or regulation is applicable.




(b)
(1)
 In any case of collective bargaining in which an exclusive representative alleges that no compelling need exists for any rule or regulation referred to in subsection (a)(3) of this section which is then in effect and which governs any matter at issue in such collective bargaining, the Authority shall determine under paragraph (2) of this subsection, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Authority, whether such a compelling need exists.




(2)
 For the purpose of this section, a compelling need shall be determined not to exist for any rule or regulation only if—
(A)
 the agency, or primary national subdivision, as the case may be, which issued the rule or regulation informs the Authority in writing that a compelling need for the rule or regulation does not exist; or




(B)
 the Authority determines that a compelling need for a rule or regulation does not exist.






(3)
 A hearing may be held, in the discretion of the Authority, before a determination is made under this subsection. If a hearing is held, it shall be expedited to the extent practicable and shall not include the General Counsel as a party.




(4)
 The agency, or primary national subdivision, as the case may be, which issued the rule or regulation shall be a necessary party at any hearing under this subsection.




(c)
(1)
 Except in any case to which subsection (b) of this section applies, if an agency involved in collective bargaining with an exclusive representative alleges that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to any matter, the exclusive representative may appeal the allegation to the Authority in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.




(2)
 The exclusive representative may, on or before the 15th day after the date on which the agency first makes the allegation referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, institute an appeal under this subsection by—
(A)
 filing a petition with the Authority; and




(B)
 furnishing a copy of the petition to the head of the agency.






(3)
 On or before the 30th day after the date of the receipt by the head of the agency of the copy of the petition under paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, the agency shall—

 withdrawing the allegation; or




(ii)
 setting forth in full its reasons supporting the allegation; and






(B)
 furnish a copy of such statement to the exclusive representative.

 The Authority shall expedite proceedings under this subsection to the extent practicable and shall issue to the exclusive representative and to the agency a written decision on the allegation and specific reasons therefor at the earliest practicable date.




(d)
(1)
 A labor organization which is the exclusive representative of a substantial number of employees, determined in accordance with criteria prescribed by the Authority, shall be granted consultation rights by any agency with respect to any Government-wide rule or regulation issued by the agency effecting any substantive change in any condition of employment. Such consultation rights shall terminate when the labor organization no longer meets the criteria prescribed by the Authority. Any issue relating to a labor organization’s eligibility for, or continuation of, such consultation rights shall be subject to determination by the Authority.




(2)
 A labor organization having consultation rights under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall—
(A)
 be informed of any substantive change in conditions of employment proposed by the agency, and




(B)
 shall be permitted reasonable time to present its views and recommendations regarding the changes.






(3)
 If any views or recommendations are presented under paragraph (2) of this subsection to an agency by any labor organization—
(A)
 the agency shall consider the views or recommendations before taking final action on any matter with respect to which the views or recommendations are presented; and




(B)
 the agency shall provide the labor organization a written statement of the reasons for taking the final action.






 Prevention of unfair labor practices
(a)
(1)
 If any agency or labor organization is charged by any person with having engaged in or engaging in an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall investigate the charge and may issue and cause to be served upon the agency or labor organization a complaint. In any case in which the General Counsel does not issue a complaint because the charge fails to state an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall provide the person making the charge a written statement of the reasons for not issuing a complaint.




(2)
 Any complaint under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall contain a notice—
(A)
 of the charge;




(B)
 that a hearing will be held before the Authority (or any member thereof or before an individual employed by the authority and designated for such purpose); and




(C)
 of the time and place fixed for the hearing.






(3)
 The labor organization or agency involved shall have the right to file an answer to the original and any amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint for the hearing.




(4)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge with the Authority.




(B)
 If the General Counsel determines that the person filing any charge was prevented from filing the charge during the 6-month period referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by reason of—
(i)
 any failure of the agency or labor organization against which the charge is made to perform a duty owed to the person, or




(ii)
 any concealment which prevented discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice during the 6-month period,





the General Counsel may issue a complaint based on the charge if the charge was filed during the 6-month period beginning on the day of the discovery by the person of the alleged unfair labor practice.






(5)
 The General Counsel may prescribe regulations providing for informal methods by which the alleged unfair labor practice may be resolved prior to the issuance of a complaint.




(6)
 The Authority (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Authority and designated for such purpose) shall conduct a hearing on the complaint not earlier than 5 days after the date on which the complaint is served. In the discretion of the individual or individuals conducting the hearing, any person involved may be allowed to intervene in the hearing and to present testimony. Any such hearing shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title, except that the parties shall not be bound by rules of evidence, whether statutory, common law, or adopted by a court. A transcript shall be kept of the hearing. After such a hearing the Authority, in its discretion, may upon notice receive further evidence or hear argument.




(7)
 If the Authority (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Authority and designated for such purpose) determines after any hearing on a complaint under paragraph (5) of this subsection that the preponderance of the evidence received demonstrates that the agency or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, then the individual or individuals conducting the hearing shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the agency or labor organization an order—
(A)
 to cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice in which the agency or labor organization is engaged;




(B)
 requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the Authority and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given retroactive effect;




(C)
 requiring reinstatement of an employee with backpay in accordance with 
section 5596 of this title
; or




(D)
 including any combination of the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter.





If any such order requires reinstatement of an employee with backpay, backpay may be required of the agency (as provided in 
section 5596 of this title
) or of the labor organization, as the case may be, which is found to have engaged in the unfair labor practice involved.




(8)
 If the individual or individuals conducting the hearing determine that the preponderance of the evidence received fails to demonstrate that the agency or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, the individual or individuals shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.




(b)
 In connection with any matter before the Authority in any proceeding under this section, the Authority may request, in accordance with the provisions of 
section 7105(i) of this title
, from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management an advisory opinion concerning the proper interpretation of rules, regulations, or other policy directives issued by the Office of Personnel Management.

 The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service shall provide services and assistance to agencies and exclusive representatives in the resolution of negotiation impasses. The Service shall determine under what circumstances and in what manner it shall provide services and assistance.


(b)
 If voluntary arrangements, including the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or any other third-party mediation, fail to resolve a negotiation impasse—
(1)
 either party may request the Federal Service Impasses Panel to consider the matter, or




(2)
 the parties may agree to adopt a procedure for binding arbitration of the negotiation impasse, but only if the procedure is approved by the Panel.




(c)
(1)
 The Federal Service Impasses Panel is an entity within the Authority, the function of which is to provide assistance in resolving negotiation impasses between agencies and exclusive representatives.




(2)
 The Panel shall be composed of a Chairman and at least six other members, who shall be appointed by the President, solely on the basis of fitness to perform the duties and functions involved, from among individuals who are familiar with Government operations and knowledgeable in labor-management relations.




(3)
 Of the original members of the Panel, 2 members shall be appointed for a term of 1 year, 2 members shall be appointed for a term of 3 years, and the Chairman and the remaining members shall be appointed for a term of 5 years. Thereafter each member shall be appointed for a term of 5 years, except that an individual chosen to fill a vacancy shall be appointed for the unexpired term of the member replaced. Any member of the Panel may be removed by the President.




(4)
 The Panel may appoint an Executive Director and any other individuals it may from time to time find necessary for the proper performance of its duties. Each member of the Panel who is not an employee (as defined in 
section 2105 of this title
) is entitled to pay at a rate equal to the daily equivalent of the maximum annual rate of basic pay then currently paid under the General Schedule for each day he is engaged in the performance of official business of the Panel, including travel time, and is entitled to travel expenses as provided under 
section 5703 of this title
.




(5)
(A)
 The Panel or its designee shall promptly investigate any impasse presented to it under subsection (b) of this section. The Panel shall consider the impasse and shall either—

 recommend to the parties procedures for the resolution of the impasse; or




(ii)
 assist the parties in resolving the impasse through whatever methods and procedures, including factfinding and recommendations, it may consider appropriate to accomplish the purpose of this section.






(B)

 hold hearings;




(ii)
 administer oaths, take the testimony or deposition of any person under oath, and issue subpenas as provided in 
section 7132 of this title
; and




(iii)
 take whatever action is necessary and not inconsistent with this chapter to resolve the impasse.






(C)
 Notice of any final action of the Panel under this section shall be promptly served upon the parties, and the action shall be binding on such parties during the term of the agreement, unless the parties agree otherwise.






 Standards of conduct for labor organizations
(a)
 An agency shall only accord recognition to a labor organization that is free from corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, an organization is not required to prove that it is free from such influences if it is subject to governing requirements adopted by the organization or by a national or international labor organization or federation of labor organizations with which it is affiliated, or in which it participates, containing explicit and detailed provisions to which it subscribes calling for—
(1)
 the maintenance of democratic procedures and practices including provisions for periodic elections to be conducted subject to recognized safeguards and provisions defining and securing the right of individual members to participate in the affairs of the organization, to receive fair and equal treatment under the governing rules of the organization, and to receive fair process in disciplinary proceedings;




(2)
 the exclusion from office in the organization of persons affiliated with communist or other totalitarian movements and persons identified with corrupt influences;




(3)
 the prohibition of business or financial interests on the part of organization officers and agents which conflict with their duty to the organization and its members; and




(4)
 the maintenance of fiscal integrity in the conduct of the affairs of the organization, including provisions for accounting and financial controls and regular financial reports or summaries to be made available to members.




(b)
 Notwithstanding the fact that a labor organization has adopted or subscribed to standards of conduct as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the organization is required to furnish evidence of its freedom from corrupt influences or influences opposed to basic democratic principles if there is reasonable cause to believe that—
(1)
 the organization has been suspended or expelled from, or is subject to other sanction, by a parent labor organization, or federation of organizations with which it had been affiliated, because it has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to comply with governing requirements comparable in purpose to those required by subsection (a) of this section; or




(2)
 the organization is in fact subject to influences that would preclude recognition under this chapter.




(c)
 A labor organization which has or seeks recognition as a representative of employees under this chapter shall file financial and other reports with the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor Management Relations, provide for bonding of officials and employees of the organization, and comply with trusteeship and election standards.


(d)
 The Assistant Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. Such regulations shall conform generally to the principles applied to labor organizations in the private sector. Complaints of violations of this section shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary. In any matter arising under this section, the Assistant Secretary may require a labor organization to cease and desist from violations of this section and require it to take such actions as he considers appropriate to carry out the policies of this section.


(e)
 This chapter does not authorize participation in the management of a labor organization or acting as a representative of a labor organization by a management official, a supervisor, or a confidential employee, except as specifically provided in this chapter, or by an employee if the participation or activity would result in a conflict or apparent conflict of interest or would otherwise be incompatible with law or with the official duties of the employee.


(f)
 In the case of any labor organization which by omission or commission has willfully and intentionally, with regard to any strike, work stoppage, or slowdown, violated 
section 7116(b)(7) of this title
, the Authority shall, upon an appropriate finding by the Authority of such violation—
(1)
 revoke the exclusive recognition status of the labor organization, which shall then immediately cease to be legally entitled and obligated to represent employees in the unit; or




(2)
 take any other appropriate disciplinary action.




 Grievance procedures
(a)
(1)
 Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.




(2)
 Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.




(b)
(1)
 Any negotiated grievance procedure referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall—
(A)
 be fair and simple,




(B)
 provide for expeditious processing, and




(C)
 include procedures that—
(i)
 assure an exclusive representative the right, in its own behalf or on behalf of any employee in the unit represented by the exclusive representative, to present and process grievances;




(ii)
 assure such an employee the right to present a grievance on the employee’s own behalf, and assure the exclusive representative the right to be present during the grievance proceeding; and




(iii)
 provide that any grievance not satisfactorily settled under the negotiated grievance procedure shall be subject to binding arbitration which may be invoked by either the exclusive representative or the agency.








(2)
(A)
 The provisions of a negotiated grievance procedure providing for binding arbitration in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(iii) shall, if or to the extent that an alleged prohibited personnel practice is involved, allow the arbitrator to order—
(i)
 a stay of any personnel action in a manner similar to the manner described in section 1221(c) with respect to the Merit Systems Protection Board; and




(ii)
 the taking, by an agency, of any disciplinary action identified under section 1215(a)(3) that is otherwise within the authority of such agency to take.






(B)
 Any employee who is the subject of any disciplinary action ordered under subparagraph (A)(ii) may appeal such action to the same extent and in the same manner as if the agency had taken the disciplinary action absent arbitration.






(c)
 The preceding subsections of this section shall not apply with respect to any grievance concerning—
(1)
 any claimed violation of subchapter III of chapter 73 of this title (relating to prohibited political activities);




(2)
 retirement, life insurance, or health insurance;




(3)
 a suspension or removal under 
section 7532 of this title
;

 the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee.




(d)
 An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 
section 2302(b)(1) of this title
 which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties’ negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first. Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to 
section 7702 of this title
 in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.


(e)
(1)
 Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of 
section 7701 of this title
 or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. Similar matters which arise under other personnel systems applicable to employees covered by this chapter may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures, if any, applicable to those matters, or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise a matter either under the applicable appellate procedures or under the negotiated grievance procedure at such time as the employee timely files a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties’ negotiated grievance procedure, whichever event occurs first.




(2)
 In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, an arbitrator shall be governed by 
section 7701(c)(1) of this title
, as applicable.




(f)
 In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, 
section 7703 of this title
 pertaining to judicial review shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board. In matters similar to those covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which arise under other personnel systems and which an aggrieved employee has raised under the negotiated grievance procedure, judicial review of an arbitrator’s award may be obtained in the same manner and on the same basis as could be obtained of a final decision in such matters raised under applicable appellate procedures.


(g)
(1)
 This subsection applies with respect to a prohibited personnel practice other than a prohibited personnel practice to which subsection (d) applies.




(2)
 An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice described in paragraph (1) may elect not more than one of the remedies described in paragraph (3) with respect thereto. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a determination as to whether a particular remedy has been elected shall be made as set forth under paragraph (4).




(3)
 The remedies described in this paragraph are as follows:
(A)
 An appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701.




(B)
 A negotiated grievance procedure under this section.




(C)
 Procedures for seeking corrective action under subchapters II and III of chapter 12.






(4)
 For the purpose of this subsection, a person shall be considered to have elected—
(A)
 the remedy described in paragraph (3)(A) if such person has timely filed a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures;




(B)
 the remedy described in paragraph (3)(B) if such person has timely filed a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties’ negotiated procedure; or




(C)
 the remedy described in paragraph (3)(C) if such person has sought corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel by making an allegation under section 1214(a)(1).






(h)
 Settlements and awards under this chapter shall be subject to the limitations in 
section 5596(b)(4) of this title
.


 Exceptions to arbitral awards
(a)
 Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator’s award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in 
section 7121(f) of this title
). If upon review the Authority finds that the award is deficient—
(1)
 because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or




(2)
 on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations;





the Authority may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.


(b)
 If no exception to an arbitrator’s award is filed under subsection (a) of this section during the 30-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding. An agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator’s final award. The award may include the payment of backpay (as provided in 
section 5596 of this title
).


 Judicial review; enforcement
(a)
 Any person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority other than an order under—
(1)
 
section 7122 of this title
 (involving an award by an arbitrator), unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under 
section 7118 of this title
, or




(2)
 
section 7112 of this title
 (involving an appropriate unit determination),





may, during the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the order was issued, institute an action for judicial review of the Authority’s order in the United States court of appeals in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.


(b)
 The Authority may petition any appropriate United States court of appeals for the enforcement of any order of the Authority and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order.


(c)
 Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (a) of this section for judicial review or under subsection (b) of this section for enforcement, the Authority shall file in the court the record in the proceedings, as provided in 
section 2112 of title 28
. Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served to the parties involved, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein and may grant any temporary relief (including a temporary restraining order) it considers just and proper, and may make and enter a decree affirming and enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the Authority. The filing of a petition under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall not operate as a stay of the Authority’s order unless the court specifically orders the stay. Review of the Authority’s order shall be on the record in accordance with 
section 706 of this title
. No objection that has not been urged before the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the Authority with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. If any person applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shows to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce the evidence in the hearing before the Authority, or its designee, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the Authority, or its designee, and to be made a part of the record. The Authority may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed. The Authority shall file its modified or new findings, which, with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. The Authority shall file its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. Upon the filing of the record with the court, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the judgment and decree shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon writ of certiorari or certification as provided in 
section 1254 of title 28
.


(d)
 The Authority may, upon issuance of a complaint as provided in 
section 7118 of this title
 charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, petition any United States district court within any district in which the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or in which such person resides or transacts business for appropriate temporary relief (including a restraining order). Upon the filing of the petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the person, and thereupon shall have jurisdiction to grant any temporary relief (including a temporary restraining order) it considers just and proper. A court shall not grant any temporary relief under this section if it would interfere with the ability of the agency to carry out its essential functions or if the Authority fails to establish probable cause that an unfair labor practice is being committed.


 Official time
(a)
 Any employee representing an exclusive representative in the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement under this chapter shall be authorized official time for such purposes, including attendance at impasse proceeding, during the time the employee otherwise would be in a duty status. The number of employees for whom official time is authorized under this subsection shall not exceed the number of individuals designated as representing the agency for such purposes.


(b)
 Any activities performed by any employee relating to the internal business of a labor organization (including the solicitation of membership, elections of labor organization officials, and collection of dues) shall be performed during the time the employee is in a non-duty status.


(c)
 Except as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Authority shall determine whether any employee participating for, or on behalf of, a labor organization in any phase of proceedings before the Authority shall be authorized official time for such purpose during the time the employee otherwise would be in a duty status.


(d)
 Except as provided in the preceding subsections of this section—
(1)
 any employee representing an exclusive representative, or




(2)
 in connection with any other matter covered by this chapter, any employee in an appropriate unit represented by an exclusive representative,





shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.


 Subpenas
(a)
 Any member of the Authority, the General Counsel, or the Panel, any administrative law judge appointed by the Authority under 
section 3105 of this title
, and any employee of the Authority designated by the Authority may—
(1)
 issue subpenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary or other evidence from any place in the United States; and
