(1)
 During the 90-day period after the date of the enactment of this Act [
July 23, 1982

“(A)
 the schedule has reduced the productivity of the agency or the level of services to the public, or has increased the cost of the agency operations, and




“(B)
 termination of the schedule will not result in an increase in the cost of the agency operations (other than a reasonable administrative cost relating to the process of terminating a schedule),





the agency shall, notwithstanding any provision of a negotiated agreement, immediately terminate such schedule and such termination shall not be subject to negotiation or to administrative review (except as the President may provide) or to judicial review.




“(2)
 If a schedule established pursuant to a negotiated agreement is terminated under paragraph (1), either the agency or the exclusive representative concerned may, by written notice to the other party within 90 days after the date of such termination, initiate collective bargaining pertaining to the establishment of another flexible or compressed work schedule under subchapter II of chapter 61 of title 5, United States Code, which would be effective for the unexpired portion of the term of the negotiated agreement.”
