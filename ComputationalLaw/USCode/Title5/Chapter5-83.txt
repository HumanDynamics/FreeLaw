section 8421 of title 5
, United States Code, shall be computed using the same service as is used for the computation under paragraph (5).




“(11)
 Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable to an annuitant’s survivor (other than a child under 
section 8443 of title 5
, United States Code) shall be increased by the total percent by which the deceased annuitant’s annuity was increased under paragraph (7).




“(12)
(A)
(i)
 If the electing individual is a reemployed annuitant under 
section 8344 of title 5
, United States Code, under conditions allowing the annuity to continue during reemployment, payment of the annuitant’s annuity shall continue after the effective date of the election, and an amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall continue to be deducted from the annuitant’s pay and deposited as provided in subsection (a) of such section. Deductions from pay under section 8422(a) of such title and contributions under section 8423 of such title shall begin effective on the effective date of the election.




“(ii)
 Notwithstanding any provision of section 301, an election under such section shall not be available to any reemployed annuitant who would be excluded from the operation of chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, under section 8402(c) of such title (relating to exclusions based on the temporary or intermittent nature of one’s employment).






“(B)
 If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, such annuitant’s annuity, on termination of reemployment, shall be increased by an annuity computed—
“(i)
 with respect to reemployment service before the effective date of the election, under section 8339(a), (b), (d), (e), (h), (i), and (n) of title 5, United States Code, as may apply based on the reemployment in which such annuitant was engaged before such effective date; and




“(ii)
 with respect to reemployment service on or after the effective date of the election, under section 8415(a) through (g) [now 8415(a)–(c), (e)–(h)] of such title, as may apply based on the reemployment in which such annuitant was engaged on or after such effective date;





with the ‘average pay’ used in any computation under clause (i) or (ii) being determined (based on rates of pay in effect during the period of reemployment, whether before, on, or after the effective date of the election) in the same way as provided for in paragraph (6). If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8339(j) or 
section 8339(k)(2) of title 5
, United States Code, the increase in annuity payable under this subparagraph is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of such title is increased by 55 percent of the increase in annuity payable under this subparagraph, unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under this subparagraph, the annuitant notifies the Office of Personnel Management in writing that such annuitant does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 1 full year (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of such title based on the service of such annuitant is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated. In applying paragraph (7) to an amount under this subparagraph, any portion of such amount attributable to clause (i) shall be adjusted under subparagraph (A) of such paragraph, and any portion of such amount attributable to clause (ii) shall be adjusted under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph.




“(C)
(i)
 If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis for at least 5 years, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 5 years of full-time service, such annuitant may elect, instead of the benefit provided by subparagraph (B), to have such annuitant’s rights redetermined, effective upon separation from employment. If the annuitant so elects, the redetermined annuity will become payable as if such annuitant were retiring for the first time based on the separation from reemployment service, and the provisions of this section concerning computation of annuity (other than any provision of this paragraph) shall apply.




“(ii)
 If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 5 full years (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any person entitled to a survivor annuity under 
section 8341(b) of title 5
, United States Code, based on the service of such annuitant shall be permitted to elect to have such person’s rights redetermined in accordance with regulations which the Office shall prescribe. Redetermined benefits elected under this clause shall be in lieu of any increased benefits which would otherwise be payable in accordance with the next to last sentence of subparagraph (B).






“(D)
 If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis for less than 1 year (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of part-time employment), any amounts withheld under 
section 8422(a) of title 5
, United States Code, from such annuitant’s pay for the period (or periods) involved shall, upon written application to the Office, be payable to such annuitant (or the appropriate survivor or survivors, determined in the order set forth in section 8342(c) of such title).




“(E)
 For purposes of determining the period of an annuitant’s reemployment service under this paragraph, a period of reemployment service shall not be taken into account unless—
“(i)
 with respect to service performed before the effective date of the election under section 301, it is service which, if performed for at least 1 full year, would have allowed such annuitant to elect under 
section 8344(a) of title 5
, United States Code, to have deductions withheld from pay; or




“(ii)
 with respect to service performed on or after the effective date of the election under section 301, it is service with respect to which deductions from pay would be required to be withheld under the second sentence of 
section 8468(a) of title 5
, United States Code.

Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection and any provision of section 206(b)(3) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement Contribution Temporary Adjustment Act of 1983, the percentage of basic pay required under this subsection in the case of an individual described in section 8402(b)(2) shall, with respect to any covered service (as defined by section 203(a)(3) of such Act) performed by such individual after 
December 31, 1983
, and before 
January 1, 1987
, be equal to 1.3 percent, and, with respect to any such service performed after 
December 31, 1986
, be equal to the amount that would have been deducted from the employee’s basic pay under subsection (k) of this section if the employee’s pay had been subject to that subsection during such period.




(d)
(1)
 Each employee or Member who has received a refund of retirement deductions under this or any other retirement system established for employees of the Government covering service for which he may be allowed credit under this subchapter may deposit the amount received, with interest. Credit may not be allowed for the service covered by the refund until the deposit is made.




(2)
(A)
 This paragraph applies with respect to any employee or Member who—
(i)
 separates before 
March 1, 1991
, and receives (or elects, in accordance with applicable provisions of this subchapter, to receive) a refund (described in paragraph (1)) which relates to a period of service ending before 
March 1, 1991
;




(ii)
 is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) which is based on service of such employee or Member, and which commences on or after 
December 2, 1990
; and




(iii)
 does not make the deposit (described in paragraph (1)) required in order to receive credit for the period of service with respect to which the refund relates.






(B)
 Notwithstanding the second sentence of paragraph (1), the annuity to which an employee or Member under this paragraph is entitled shall (subject to adjustment under section 8340) be equal to an amount which, when taken together with the unpaid amount referred to in subparagraph (A)(iii), would result in the present value of the total being actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided the employee or Member under this subchapter, as computed under subsections (a)–(i) and (n) of section 8339 (treating, for purposes of so computing the annuity which would otherwise be provided under this subchapter, the deposit referred to in subparagraph (A)(iii) as if it had been timely made).




(C)
 The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.






(e)
(1)
 Interest under subsection (c), (d)(1), (j), (k), or (
l
) of this section is computed in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection and regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management.




(2)
 Interest accrues annually on the outstanding portion of any amount that may be deposited under subsection (c), (d)(1), (j), (k), or (
l
) of this section, and is compounded annually, until the portion is deposited. Such interest is computed from the mid-point of each service period included in the computation, or from the date refund was paid. The deposit may be made in one or more installments. Interest may not be charged for a period of separation from the service which began before 
October 1, 1956
.




(3)
 The rate of interest is 4 percent a year through 
December 31, 1947
, and 3 percent a year beginning 
January 1, 1948
, through 
December 31, 1984
. Thereafter, the rate of interest for any calendar year shall be equal to the overall average yield to the Fund during the preceding fiscal year from all obligations purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury during such fiscal year under section 8348(c), (d), and (e) of this title, as determined by the Secretary.




(f)
 Under such regulations as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, amounts deducted under subsection (a) or (k) of this section and deposited under subsections (c) and (d)(1) of this section shall be entered on individual retirement records.


(g)
 Deposit may not be required for—
(1)
 service before 
August 1, 1920
;




(2)
 military service, except to the extent provided under section 8332(c) or 
section 8334(j) of this title

(1)
 The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall pay to the Fund the amount which an employee may deposit under subsection (c) of this section for service creditable under 
section 8332(b)(12) of this title
 if such creditable service immediately precedes service as an employee subject to this subchapter with a break in service of no more than ninety working days. The Director shall pay such amount from any appropriation available to him as a necessary expense of the appropriation concerned.




(2)
 The amount the Director pays in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of any refund to the employee under 
section 376 of title 28
. Except to the extent of such reduction, the amount the Director pays to the Fund shall satisfy the deposit requirement of subsection (c) of this section.




(3)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the amount the Director pays under this subsection shall constitute an employer contribution to the Fund, excludable under section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the employee’s gross income until such time as the contribution is distributed or made available to the employee, and shall not be subject to refund or to lump-sum payment to the employee.




(4)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a bankruptcy judge or magistrate judge who is covered by 
section 377 of title 28
 or section 2(c) of the Retirement and Survivors’ Annuities for Bankruptcy Judges and Magistrates Act of 1988 shall not be subject to deductions and contributions to the Fund, if the judge or magistrate judge notifies the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts of an election of a retirement annuity under those provisions. Upon such an election, the judge or magistrate judge shall be entitled to a lump-sum credit under 
section 8342(a) of this title
.




(5)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a judge who is covered by 
section 7296 of title 38

section 8342(a) of this title
.




(6)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims who is covered by 
section 178 of title 28
 shall not be subject to deductions and contributions to the Fund if the judge notifies the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts of an election of a retirement annuity under those provisions. Upon such an election, the judge shall be entitled to a lump-sum credit under 
section 8342(a) of this title
.




(j)
(1)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B), and subject to paragraph (5), each employee or Member who has performed military service before the date of the separation on which the entitlement to any annuity under this subchapter is based may pay, in accordance with such regulations as the Office shall issue, to the agency by which the employee is employed, or, in the case of a Member or a Congressional employee, to the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, as appropriate, an amount equal to 7 percent of the amount of the basic pay paid under 
section 204 of title 37
 to the employee or Member for each period of military service after December 1956. The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence of basic pay for military service as the employee or Member may provide, or if the Office determines sufficient evidence has not been so provided to adequately determine basic pay for military service, such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay provided to the Office under paragraph (4).




(B)
 In any case where military service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and reemployment pursuant to chapter 43 of title 38 occurs on or after 
August 1, 1990
, the deposit payable under this paragraph may not exceed the amount that would have been deducted and withheld under subsection (a)(1) from basic pay during civilian service if the employee had not performed the period of military service.






(2)
 Any deposit made under paragraph (1) of this subsection more than two years after the later of—
(A)
 
October 1, 1983
; or




(B)
 the date on which the employee or Member making the deposit first becomes an employee or Member following the period of military service for which such deposit is due,





shall include interest on such amount computed and compounded annually beginning on the date of the expiration of the two-year period. The interest rate that is applicable in computing interest in any year under this paragraph shall be equal to the interest rate that is applicable for such year under subsection (e) of this section.




(3)
 Any payment received by an agency, the Secretary of the Senate, or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives under this subsection shall be immediately remitted to the Office for deposit in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund.




(4)
 The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as appropriate, shall furnish such information to the Office as the Office may determine to be necessary for the administration of this subsection.

section 204 of title 37
 payable under paragraph (1) shall be equal to the same percentage as would be applicable under subsection (c) of this section for that same period for service as an employee, subject to paragraph (1)(B).




(k)
(1)
 Effective with respect to pay periods beginning after 
December 31, 1986
, in administering this section in the case of an individual described in 
section 8402(b)(2) of this title

(2)
(A)
 With respect to Federal wages of an employee or Member (or that portion thereof) not exceeding the contribution and benefit base during the calendar year involved, the appropriate amount to be deducted and withheld under this subsection is the amount by which—

 A phased retirement annuity shall be paid in addition to the basic pay for the position to which a phased retiree is appointed during phased employment.




(3)
 A phased retirement annuity shall be adjusted in accordance with section 8340.




(4)
(A)
 A phased retirement annuity shall not be subject to reduction for any form of survivor annuity, shall not serve as the basis of the computation of any survivor annuity, and shall not be subject to any court order requiring a survivor annuity to be provided to any individual.




(B)
 A phased retirement annuity shall be subject to a court order providing for division, allotment, assignment, execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process on the same basis as other annuities.






(5)
 Any reduction of a phased retirement annuity based on an election under section 8334(d)(2) shall be applied to the phased retirement annuity after computation under paragraph (1).




(6)
(A)
 Any deposit, or election of an actuarial annuity reduction in lieu of a deposit, for military service or for creditable civilian service for which retirement deductions were not made or refunded shall be made by a retirement-eligible employee at or before the time the retirement-eligible employee enters phased retirement status. No such deposit may be made, or actuarial adjustment in lieu thereof elected, at the time a phased retiree enters full retirement status.




(B)
 Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if a phased retiree does not make such a deposit and dies in service as a phased retiree, a survivor of the phased retiree shall have the same right to make such deposit as would have been available had the employee not entered phased retirement status and died in service.




(C)
 If a phased retiree makes an election for an actuarial annuity reduction under section 8334(d)(2) and dies in service as a phased retiree, the amount of any deposit upon which such actuarial reduction shall have been based shall be deemed to have been fully paid.






(7)
 A phased retirement annuity shall commence on the date on which a phased retiree enters phased employment.




(8)
 No unused sick leave credit may be used in the computation of the phased retirement annuity.




(d)
 All basic pay not in excess of the full-time rate of pay for the position to which a phased retiree is appointed shall be deemed to be basic pay for purposes of section 8334.

(f)
(1)
 Except as provided otherwise under this subsection, a composite retirement annuity is a single annuity computed under regulations prescribed by the Director, equal to the sum of—
(A)
 the amount of the phased retirement annuity as of the date of full retirement, before any reduction based on an election under section 8334(d)(2), and including any adjustments made under section 8340; and




(B)
 the product obtained by multiplying—
(i)
 the amount of an annuity computed under section 8339 that would have been payable at the time of full retirement if the individual had not elected a phased retirement and as if the individual was employed on a full-time basis in the position occupied during the phased retirement period and before any reduction for survivor annuity or reduction based on an election under section 8334(d)(2); by




(ii)
 the working percentage.








(2)
 After computing a composite retirement annuity under paragraph (1), the Director shall adjust the amount of the annuity for any applicable reductions for a survivor annuity and any previously elected actuarial reduction under section 8334(d)(2).




(3)
 A composite retirement annuity shall be adjusted in accordance with section 8340, except that subsection (c)(1) of that section shall not apply.




(4)
 In computing a composite retirement annuity under paragraph (1)(B)(i), the unused sick leave to the credit of a phased retiree at the time of entry into full retirement status shall be adjusted by dividing the number of hours of unused sick leave by the working percentage.




(g)
(1)
 Under such procedures and conditions as the Director may provide, and with the concurrence of the head of the employing agency, a phased retiree may elect to terminate phased retirement status and return to a full-time work schedule.




(2)
 Upon entering a full-time work schedule based upon an election under paragraph (1), the phased retirement annuity of a phased retiree shall terminate.




(3)
 After the termination of a phased retirement annuity under this subsection, the individual’s rights under this subchapter shall be determined based on the law in effect at the time of any subsequent separation from service. For purposes of this subchapter or chapter 84, at time of the subsequent separation from service, the phased retirement period shall be treated as if it had been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in subsection (b)(2).




(h)
 For purposes of section 8341—
(1)
 the death of a phased retiree shall be deemed to be the death in service of an employee; and




(2)
 the phased retirement period shall be deemed to have been a period of part-time employment with the work schedule described in subsection (b)(2).




(i)
 Employment of a phased retiree shall not be deemed to be part-time career employment, as defined in section 3401(2).


(j)
 A phased retiree is not eligible to apply for an annuity under section 8337.


(k)
 For purposes of section 8341(h)(4), retirement shall be deemed to occur on the date on which a phased retiree enters into full retirement status.


(l)
 For purposes of sections 8343 and 8351, and subchapter III of chapter 84, a phased retiree shall be deemed to be an employee.


(m)
 A phased retiree is not subject to section 8344.


(n)
 For purposes of chapter 87, a phased retiree shall be deemed to be receiving basic pay at the rate of a full-time employee in the position to which the phased retiree is appointed.


 Disability retirement
(a)
 An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee’s own application or on application by the employee’s agency. Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee’s position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, an employee of the United States Postal Service shall be considered not qualified for a reassignment described in that sentence if the reassignment is to a position in a different craft or is inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee. A judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces who completes 5 years of civilian service and who is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a judge of such court or who is removed for mental or physical disability under 
section 942(c) of title 10
 shall be retired on the judge’s own application or upon such removal. A Member who completes 5 years of Member service and is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a Member because of disease or injury shall be retired on the Member’s own application. An annuity authorized by this section is computed under 
section 8339(g) of this title
, unless the employee or Member is eligible for a higher annuity computed under section 8339(a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), or (s).


(b)
 A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.


(c)
 An annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund shall be examined under the direction of the Office—
(1)
 at the end of 1 year from the date of the disability retirement; and




(2)
 annually thereafter until he becomes 60 years of age;





unless his disability is permanent in character. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required by this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.


(d)
 If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, recovers from his disability, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 1 year after the date of the medical examination showing the recovery, whichever is earlier. If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.


(e)
 If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (d) of this section is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, he is deemed, except for service credit, to have been involuntarily separated from the service for the purpose of this subchapter as of the date of termination of the disability annuity, and after that termination is entitled to annuity under the applicable provisions of this subchapter. If an annuitant whose annuity is heretofore or hereafter terminated because of an earning capacity provision of this subchapter or an earlier statute—
(1)
 is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter; and




(2)
 has not recovered from the disability for which he was retired;





his annuity shall be restored at the same rate effective the first of the year following any calendar year in which his income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement. If an annuitant whose annuity is heretofore or hereafter terminated because of a medical finding that he has recovered from disability is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, his annuity shall be restored at the same rate effective from the date of medical examination showing a recurrence of the disability. The second and third sentences of this subsection do not apply to an individual who has become 62 years of age and is receiving or is eligible to receive annuity under the first sentence of this subsection.


(f)
(1)
 An individual is not entitled to receive—
(A)
 an annuity under this subchapter, and




(B)
 compensation for injury to, or disability of, such individual under subchapter I of chapter 81, other than compensation payable under section 8107,





covering the same period of time.




(2)
 An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 on account of the death of the same person.




(3)
 Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or subchapter I of chapter 81.




(g)
 If an individual is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter, and the individual receives a lump-sum payment for compensation under section 8135 based on the disability or death of the same person, so much of the compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the Department of Labor, shall be refunded to that Department for credit to the Employees’ Compensation Fund. Before the individual may receive the annuity, the individual shall—
(1)
 refund to the Department of Labor the amount representing the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or




(2)
 authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.





Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the annuity shall be transmitted to the Department of Labor for reimbursement to the Employees’ Compensation Fund. When the Department of Labor finds that the financial circumstances of an individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter warrant deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Department determines appropriate.


(h)
(1)
 As used in this subsection, the term “technician” means an individual employed under 
section 709(a) of title 32
 or 
section 10216 of title 10
 who, as a condition of the employment, is required under 
section 709(b) of title 32
 or 
section 10216 of title 10
, respectively, to be a member of the Selected Reserve.




(2)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, an individual shall be retired under this section if the individual—
(i)
 is separated from employment as a technician under 
section 709(e)(1) of title 32
 or 
section 10216 of title 10
 by reason of a disability that disqualifies the individual from membership in the Selected Reserve;




(ii)
 is not considered to be disabled under the second sentence of subsection (a) of this section;




(iii)
 is not appointed to a position in the Government (whether under paragraph (3) of this subsection or otherwise); and




(iv)
 has not declined an offer of an appointment to a position in the Government under paragraph (3) of this subsection.






(B)
 Payment of any annuity for an individual pursuant to this subsection terminates—
(i)
 on the date the individual is appointed to a position in the Government (whether pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection or otherwise);




(ii)
 on the date the individual declines an offer of appointment to a position in the Government under paragraph (3); or




(iii)
 as provided under subsection (d).








(3)
 Any individual applying for or receiving any annuity pursuant to this subsection shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office, be considered by any agency of the Government before any vacant position in the agency is filled if—
(A)
 the position is located within the commuting area of the individual’s former position;




(B)
 the individual is qualified to serve in such position, as determined by the head of the agency; and




(C)
 the position is at the same grade or equivalent level as the position from which the individual was separated under 
section 709(e)(1) of title 32
 or 
section 10216 of title 10
.






 Deferred retirement
(a)
 An employee who is separated from the service or transferred to a position in which he does not continue subject to this subchapter after completing 5 years of civilian service is entitled to an annuity beginning at the age of 62 years.


(b)
 A Member who, after 
December 31, 1955
, is separated from the service as a Member after completing 5 years of civilian service is entitled to an annuity beginning at the age of 62 years. A Member who is separated from the service after completing 10 or more years of Member service is entitled to an annuity beginning at the age of 60 years. A Member who is separated from the service after completing 20 or more years of service, including 10 or more years of Member service, is entitled to a reduced annuity beginning at the age of 50 years.


(c)
 A judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces who is separated from the service after completing 5 years of civilian service is entitled to an annuity beginning at the age of 62 years. A judge of such court who is separated from the service after completing the term of service for which he was appointed is entitled to an annuity. If an annuity is elected before the judge becomes 60 years of age, it shall be a reduced annuity.


(d)
 An annuity or reduced annuity authorized by this section is computed under 
section 8339 of this title

 1½ percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as does not exceed 5 years; plus




(2)
 1¾ percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 5 years but does not exceed 10 years; plus




(3)
 2 percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds 10 years.

(b)
 The annuity of a Congressional employee, or former Congressional employee, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a) of this section, except, if he has had—
(1)

, is computed with respect to the period of continuous Panama Canal service from that date, disregarding any break in service of not more than 3 days, by adding—
(A)

(3)
 The annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter who is employed by the Panama Canal Commission at any time during the period beginning 
October 1, 1990
, and ending 
December 31, 1999
, is computed, with respect to any period of service with the Panama Canal Commission, by adding—
(A)
 2½ percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of that service as does not exceed 20 years; plus




(B)
 2 percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of that service as exceeds 20 years.






(4)
(A)

(B)
 In the case of an employee retiring under this subchapter who—
(i)
 was employed as a law enforcement officer or firefighter by the Panama Canal Company or Canal Zone Government at any time during the period beginning

(A)
 2½ percent of the employee’s average pay multiplied by so much of the employee’s service on or after that date as does not exceed 20 years; plus

section 8332 of this title
, his annuity is computed by multiplying 2½ percent of his average pay by the years of that service.




(e)
 The annuity of an employee retiring under 
section 8336(e) of this title
 is computed under subsection (a) of this section. That annuity may not be less than 50 percent of the average pay of the employee unless such employee has received, pursuant to 
section 8342 of this title
, payment of the lump-sum credit attributable to deductions under 
section 8334(a) of this title
 during any period of employment as an air traffic controller and such employee has not deposited in the Fund the amount received, with interest, pursuant to

 the sum obtained under subsections (a) through (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s) after increasing his service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of separation and the date he becomes 60 years of age.





However, if an employee or Member retiring under 
section 8337 of this title
 is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of this title) or pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that employee or Member shall be computed under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate, excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the smaller of the annuity otherwise payable under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate.


(h)
 The annuity computed under subsections (a), (b), (d)(5), and (f) of this section for an employee retiring under section 8336(d), (h), (j), or (
o
) of this title is reduced by ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month the employee is under 55 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (c) and (f) of this section for a Member retiring under the second or third sentence of 
section 8336(g) of this title
 or the third sentence of 
section 8338(b) of this title
 is reduced by 
1
⁄
12
 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the Member is under 60 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (a), (d)(6), and (f) of this section for a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces retiring under the second sentence of 
section 8336(k) of this title
 or the third sentence of 
section 8338(c) of this title
 is reduced by 
1
⁄
12
 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and ⅙ of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the judge is under 60 years of age at the date of separation.


(i)
 For the purposes of subsections (a)–(h), (n), (q), (r), or (s), the total service of any employee or Member shall not include any period of civilian service after 
July 31, 1920
, for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been made under 
section 8334(a) of this title
 unless—
(1)
 the employee or Member makes a deposit for such period as provided in section 8334(c) or (d)(1) of this title; or




(2)
 no deposit is required for such service, as provided under 
section 8334(g) of this title
 or under any statute.




(j)
(1)
 The annuity computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) (or a portion of the annuity, if jointly designated for this purpose by the employee or Member and the spouse of the employee or Member under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management) for an employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this subchapter is reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse under 
section 8341(b) of this title
, unless the employee or Member and the spouse jointly waive the spouse’s right to a survivor annuity in a written election filed with the Office at the time that the employee or Member retires. Each such election shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Office shall, by regulation, prescribe, and shall be irrevocable. The Office shall provide, by regulation, that an employee or Member may waive the survivor annuity without the spouse’s consent if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office—
(A)
 that the spouse’s whereabouts cannot be determined, or




(B)
 that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse’s consent would otherwise be inappropriate.






(2)
 If an employee or Member has a former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity as provided in 
section 8341(h) of this title
, the annuity of the employee or Member computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) (or any designated portion of the annuity, in the event that the former spouse is entitled to less than 55 percent of the employee or Member’s annuity) is reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection.




(3)
 An employee or Member who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to have the annuity computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) or a portion thereof reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under 
section 8341(h) of this title
, unless all rights to survivor benefits for such former spouse under this subchapter based on marriage to such employee or Member were waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection. An election under this paragraph shall be made at the time of retirement or, if later, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is dissolved, subject to a deposit in the Fund by the retired employee or Member of an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such employee or Member would have been reduced if the election had been continuously in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent. The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under this paragraph by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under this paragraph, except that the total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by the provisions of this paragraph, paragraph (5), or subsection (k)(2) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under this paragraph, shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the entitlement of the former spouse. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under the first sentence of this paragraph. An election under this paragraph—
(A)
 shall not be effective to the extent that it—
(i)
 conflicts with—
(I)
 any court order or decree referred to in subsection (h)(1) of 
section 8341 of this title
, which was issued before the date of such election; or




(II)
 any agreement referred to in such subsection which was entered into before such date; or






(ii)
 would cause the total of survivor annuities payable under subsections (b), (d), (f), and (h) of 
section 8341 of this title
 based on the service of the employee or Member to exceed 55 percent of the annuity to which the employee or Member is entitled under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s); and






(B)
 shall not be effective, in the case of an employee or Member who is then married, unless it is made with the spouse’s written consent.





The Office shall provide by regulation that subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may be waived for either of the reasons set forth in the last sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection. In the case of a retired employee or Member whose annuity is being reduced in order to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse, an election to provide or increase a survivor annuity for any other former spouse (and to continue an appropriate reduction) may be made within the same period that, and subject to the same conditions under which, an election could be made under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection for a current spouse (subject to the provisions of this paragraph relating to consent of a current spouse, if the retired employee or Member is then married). The opportunity to make an election under the preceding sentence is in addition to any opportunity otherwise afforded under this paragraph.




(4)
 In order to provide a survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under subsections (b), (d), (f), and (h) of 
section 8341 of this title
, the annuity of an employee or Member (or any designated portion or portions thereof) is reduced by 2½ percent of the first $3,600 thereof plus 10 percent of so much thereof as exceeds $3,600.




(5)
(A)
 Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for the current spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month—
(i)
 after the death of the spouse, or




(ii)
 after the dissolution of the spouse’s marriage to the employee or Member, except that an appropriate reduction shall be made thereafter if the spouse is entitled, as a former spouse, to a survivor annuity under 
section 8341(h) of this title

(B)
 Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for a former spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month after the former spouse remarries before reaching age 55 or dies. This reduction shall be replaced by an appropriate reduction or reductions under paragraph (4) of this subsection if the retired employee or Member has (i) another former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity under 
section 8341(h) of this title
, (ii) a current spouse to whom the employee or Member was married at the time of retirement and with respect to whom a survivor annuity was not jointly waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or (iii) a current spouse whom the employee or Member married after retirement and with respect to whom an election has been made under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph or subsection (k)(2) of this section.




(C)
(i)
 Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement (including an employee or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee or Member’s spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement) may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such remarriage or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under 
section 8341(h) of this title
 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the employee or Member’s annuity under paragraph (4) of this subsection for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee or Member’s spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.




(ii)
 Such election and reduction shall be effective the first day of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage, and the retired employee or Member shall deposit in the Fund an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such retired employee or Member would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement or, if later, the date the previous reduction in such retired employee or Member’s annuity was terminated under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which an annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the applicable date referred to in such sentence shall be 6 percent.




(iii)
 The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under clause (ii) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under clause (ii), except that total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by the provisions of this paragraph or paragraph (3) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction required by this clause, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under clause (i), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under clause (i).




(iv)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, an election under this subparagraph may not be made for the purpose of providing an annuity in the case of a spouse by remarriage if such spouse was married to the employee or Member at the time of such employee or Member’s retirement, and all rights to survivor benefits for such spouse under this subchapter based on marriage to such employee or Member were then waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection or a similar prior provision of law.




(v)
 An election to provide a survivor annuity to a person under this subparagraph—
(I)
 shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under subsection (k)(1) of this section with respect to such person; or




(II)
 shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under such subsection (k)(1) with respect to a different person, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subparagraph.






(vi)
 The deposit provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph shall not apply if—
(I)
 the employee or Member makes an election under this subparagraph after having made an election under subsection (k)(1) of this section; and




(II)
 the election under such subsection (k)(1) becomes void under clause (v) of this subparagraph.










(k)
(1)
 At the time of retiring under section 8336 or 8338 of this title, an employee or Member who is found to be in good health by the Office may elect a reduced annuity instead of an annuity computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) and name in writing an individual having an insurable interest in the employee or Member to receive an annuity under 
section 8341(c) of this title
 after the death of the retired employee or Member. The annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual named is younger than the retiring employee or Member. However, the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent. An annuity which is reduced under this paragraph or any similar prior provision of law shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the individual named under this paragraph, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced. In the case of a married employee or Member, an election under this paragraph on behalf of the spouse may be made only if any right of such spouse to a survivor annuity based on the service of such employee or Member is waived in accordance with subsection (j)(1) of this section.




(2)
(A)
 An employee or Member, who is unmarried at the time of retiring under a provision of law which permits election of a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity payable to such employee or Member’s spouse and who later marries, may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received in the Office within 2 years after such employee or Member marries or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under 
section 8341(h) of this title
 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the retired employee or Member’s current annuity as provided in subsection (j) of this section.




(B)
(i)
 The election and reduction shall take effect on the first day of the first month beginning after the expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of marriage. Any such election to provide a survivor annuity for a person—
(I)
 shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to such person; or




(II)
 shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under such paragraph with respect to a different person, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this paragraph.






(ii)
 The retired employee or Member shall deposit in the Fund an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the retired employee or Member’s annuity would have been reduced under subsection (j)(4) of this section since the commencing date of the annuity, if the employee or Member had been married at the time of retirement and had elected to provide a survivor annuity at that time, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent.






(C)
 The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under subparagraph (B)(ii) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under subparagraph (B)(ii), except that total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by this subsection or subsection (j)(3) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction required by this subparagraph, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under subparagraph (A), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under subparagraph (A).




(D)
 Subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C) of this paragraph shall not apply if—
(i)
 the employee or Member makes an election under this paragraph after having made an election under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and




(ii)
 the election under such paragraph (1) becomes void under subparagraph (B)(i) of this paragraph.








(l)
 The annuity computed under subsections (a)–(k), (n), (q), (r), and (s) for an employee who is a citizen of the United States is increased by $36 for each year of service in the employ of—
(1)
 the Alaska Engineering Commission, or The Alaska Railroad, in Alaska between 
March 12, 1914
, and 
July 1, 1923
; or

May 4, 1904

(m)
 In computing any annuity under subsections (a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), and (s), the total service of an employee who retires on an immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes, without regard to the limitations imposed by subsection (f) of this section, the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system, except that these days will not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter. For the purpose of this subsection, in the case of any such employee who is excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 of this title under section 6301(2)(x)–(xiii) of this title, the days of unused sick leave to his credit include any unused sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from such subchapter.


(n)
 The annuity of an employee who is a Court of Federal Claims judge, bankruptcy judge, or United States magistrate judge is computed, with respect to service as a Court of Federal Claims judge, as a commissioner of the Court of Claims, as a referee in bankruptcy, as a bankruptcy judge, as a United States magistrate judge, and as a United States commissioner, and with respect to the military service of any such individual (not exceeding 5 years) creditable under 
section 8332 of this title
, by multiplying 2½ percent of the individual’s average pay by the years of that service.


(o)
(1)
(A)
 An employee or Member—
(i)
 who, at the time of retirement, is married, and




(ii)
 who notifies the Office at such time (in accordance with subsection (j)) that a survivor annuity under 
section 8341(b) of this title
 is not desired,





may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such employee or Member, elect to have a reduction under subsection (j) made in the annuity of the employee or Member (or in such portion thereof as the employee or Member may designate) in order to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse of such employee or Member.




(B)
 An employee or Member—
(i)
 who, at the time of retirement, is married, and




(ii)

section 8341(b) of this title
,





may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of the retirement of such employee or Member, elect to have a greater portion of the annuity of such employee or Member so used.






(2)
(A)
 An election under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be considered effective unless the amount specified in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the applicable 18-month period under paragraph (1).




(B)
 The amount to be deposited with respect to an election under this subsection is an amount equal to the sum of—
(i)
 the additional cost to the System which is associated with providing a survivor annuity under subsection (b)(2) of this section and results from such election taking into account (I) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the participant or former participant commences and the date of the election) between the amount paid to such participant or former participant under this subchapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time the participant or former participant applied for the annuity, and (II) the costs associated with providing for the later election; and




(ii)
 interest on the additional cost determined under clause (i) of this subparagraph computed using the interest rate specified or determined under 
section 8334(e) of this title
 for the calendar year in which the amount to be deposited is determined.








(3)
 An election by an employee or Member under this subsection voids prospectively any election previously made in the case of such employee or Member under subsection (j).




(4)
 An annuity which is reduced in connection with an election under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage reductions as were in effect at the time of the retirement of the employee or Member whose annuity is so reduced.




(5)
 Rights and obligations resulting from the election of a reduced annuity under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the employee or Member involved elected such annuity at the time of retiring.




(6)
 The Office shall, on an annual basis, inform each employee or Member who is eligible to make an election under this subsection of the right to make such election and the procedures and deadlines applicable to such election.




(p)

 In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service that was performed on a part-time basis—
(A)
 the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and




(B)
 the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee’s actual service, as determined by prorating an employee’s total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.






(2)
 For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.




(3)
 In the administration of paragraph (1)—

(1)
 2½ percent of the member’s average pay multiplied by so much of such member’s total service as does not exceed 20 years; plus




(2)
 2 percent of the member’s average pay multiplied by so much of such member’s total service as exceeds 20 years.

However, the increase in a survivor annuity authorized by 
section 8 of the Act of May 29, 1930

 there is no surviving spouse of the employee or Member and no other former spouse of such employee or Member who is entitled to receive a survivor annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5, United States Code, based on the service of such employee or Member which is creditable under such subchapter and there is no other person who has been designated to receive a survivor annuity under such subchapter by reason of an insurable interest in such employee or Member.






“(B)
 For the purposes of this paragraph, the term ‘surviving spouse’ means a widow or a widower as defined in paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively, of 
section 8341(a) of title 5
, United States Code.






“(5)
 A survivor annuity provided under this subsection shall be 55 per centum of the annuity of the retired employee or Member (or of that portion of the annuity which such employee or Member may have designated for this purpose under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection), as determined under section 8339(a)–(i) and (n) of title 5, United States Code, increased by—
“(A)
 the total percent increase the retired employee or Member was receiving under section 8340 of such title at death, or




“(B)
 in the case of a retired employee or Member whose date of death precedes the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act [
Nov. 8, 1984
], the total percent increase the retired employee or Member would have received under such section 8340 had such individual died on the one hundred and eightieth day after such date of enactment,





and shall not be subject to reduction under section 8341(h)(2) of such title, as amended by this Act.




“(c)
 Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, an employee or Member who retired before the one hundred and eightieth day after the date of enactment of this Act [
Nov. 8, 1984
] and who is married to a spouse acquired after retirement for whom such employee or Member was unable to provide a survivor annuity because—
“(1)
 the employee or Member was married at the time of retirement and elected not to provide a survivor annuity for the employee or Member’s spouse at the time of retirement, or




“(2)
 the employee or Member failed to notify the Office of the employee or Member’s post-retirement marriage within one year after the marriage,





may elect in writing, within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Office, to provide for a survivor annuity for such spouse under 
section 8341(b) of title 5
, United States Code, as amended by this Act, to have the retired employee or Member’s annuity reduced under section 8339(j) of such title, as so amended, and to deposit in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which such employee or Member’s annuity would have been reduced had the election been continuously in effect since the annuity commenced, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent. If the retired employee or Member does not make such deposit, the Office shall collect such amount by offset against such employee or Member’s annuity, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the net annuity otherwise payable to such employee or Member, and such employee or Member is deemed to consent to such offset. The Office shall provide for general public notice of the right to make an election under this subsection. In cases to which paragraph (2) of this subsection applies, the retired employee or Member shall provide the Office with such documentation as the Office shall decide is appropriate, that such employee or Member attempted to elect a reduced annuity with survivor benefit for such employee or Member’s current spouse and that such employee or Member’s election was rejected by the Office because it was untimely filed.


“(d)
 A deposit required by subsection (b)(1)(A) or (c) of this section may be made by the surviving former spouse or spouse, as applicable, of the retired employee or Member.


“(e)
 The Office shall determine at the end of each fiscal year—
“(1)
 the cost of survivor annuities provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, less an amount determined appropriate by the Office to reflect the value of any deposits made under subsection (b)(1)(A), (c), or (d), and




“(2)
 the cost of administering subsections (b) and (c).





The Office shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the amounts so determined. The Secretary of the Treasury, before closing the account for the fiscal year in question, shall credit to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such amounts, which shall be available in the same manner as provided under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 
section 8348(a)(1) of title 5
, United States Code, as amended by this Act.


“(f)
 Any individual—
“(1)
 who is entitled to a survivor annuity under subsection (b) of this section or pursuant to an election authorized by reason of the application of subsection (a)(5) of this section,




“(2)
 as to whom a court order or decree referred to in 
section 8345(j) of title 5
, United States Code (or similar provision of law under a retirement system for Government employees other than the Civil Service Retirement System) has been issued before 
May 7, 1985
, or




“(3)
 who is entitled (other than as described in paragraph (2)) to an annuity or any portion of an annuity as a former spouse under a retirement system for Government employees as of 
May 7, 1985
,





shall be considered to have satisfied 
section 8901(10)(C) of title 5
, United States Code, as amended by this Act. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2) of this section, any such individual who otherwise meets the definition of a former spouse under 
section 8901 of title 5
, United States Code, as so amended, may, within 12 months after the date of the enactment of the Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986 [
Feb. 27, 1986
], enroll in an approved health benefits plan described by section 8903 of such title, under the conditions set forth in section 8905(c) of such title, as so amended (other than the conditions prescribed in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of such section 8905(c)).


“(g)
(1)
 For purposes of subsections (a)(1), (b), (c), (d), and (e), ‘employee’, ‘Member’, and ‘former spouse’ each has the meaning given that term under 
section 8331 of title 5
, United States Code, as amended by this Act.




“(2)
 For purposes of subsection (a)(2), ‘employee’ and ‘annuitant’ each has the meaning given that term under 
section 8901 of title 5
, United States Code.




“(h)
 Section 827 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 [
22 U.S.C. 4067
] and section 292 of the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees [former 
50 U.S.C. 403
 note] shall not apply with respect to either the amendments made by section 2 [amending sections 8331, 8334, 8339, 8341, 8342, 8345, and 8348 of this title] or the preceding provisions of this section.”


“(a)
 Upon application to the Civil Service Commission, the annuity of—
“(1)
 a surviving spouse of an employee which was terminated under the provisions of section 8341 (b) or (d) of title 5, United States Code, or of any prior applicable law, because of the remarriage of such spouse before 
July 18, 1966
, and




“(2)
 a surviving spouse of a Member who died before 
January 8, 1971
, which was terminated under any such provision, because of the remarriage of such spouse,





shall be restored in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.


“(b)
(1)
 In the case of a remarriage occurring after the surviving spouse became sixty years of age, the annuity shall be restored to such spouse under subsection (a) of this section only if any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. If such amount is paid, the annuity shall be so restored commencing on the effective date of this section at the rate which would have been in effect if the annuity had not been terminated.




“(2)
 In the case of a remarriage occurring before the surviving spouse became sixty years of age, the annuity shall be restored to such spouse under subsection (a) of this section only if—
“(A)
 such spouse elects to receive this annuity instead of a survivor benefit to which the spouse may be entitled under subchapter III of chapter 83 of such title 5 or under another retirement system for Government employees by reason of the marriage; and




“(B)
 any lump sum paid on termination of the annuity is returned to such fund.





If the requirements of the preceding sentence are satisfied, such annuity shall be so restored commencing on the effective date of this section or on the first day of the month following the date the remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce, whichever date is later, at the rate which was in effect when the annuity was terminated.”




 Lump-sum benefits; designation of beneficiary; order of precedence
(a)
 Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an employee or Member who—
(1)
(A)
 is separated from the service for at least thirty-one consecutive days; or




(B)
 is transferred to a position in which he is not subject to this subchapter, or chapter 84 of this title, and remains in such a position for at least thirty-one consecutive days;






(2)
 files an application with the Office of Personnel Management for payment of the lump-sum credit;




(3)
 is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, or chapter 84 of this title, at the time he files the application; and




(4)
 will not become eligible to receive an annuity within thirty-one days after filing the application,





is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Except as provided in section 8343a or 8334(d)(2) of this title, the receipt of the payment of the lump-sum credit by the employee or Member voids all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the employee or Member is reemployed in the service subject to this subchapter. In applying this subsection to an employee or Member who becomes subject to chapter 84 (other than by an election under title III of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986) and who, while subject to such chapter, files an application with the Office for a payment under this subsection—


(i)
 entitlement to payment of the lump-sum credit shall be determined without regard to paragraph (1) or (3) if, or to the extent that, such lump-sum credit relates to service of a type described in clauses (i) through (iii) of section 302(a)(1)(C) of the Federal Employees’ Retirement System Act of 1986; and




(ii)
 if, or to the extent that, the lump-sum credit so relates to service of a type referred to in clause (i), it shall (notwithstanding section 8331(8)) consist of—
(I)
 the amount by which any unrefunded amount described in section 8331(8)(A) or (B) relating to such service, exceeds 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service; and




(II)
 interest on the amount payable under subclause (I), computed in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of section 8331(8).






(b)
 Under regulations prescribed by the Office, a present or former employee or Member may designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries for the purpose of this subchapter.


(c)
 Lump-sum benefits authorized by subsections (d)–(f) of this section shall be paid to the person or persons surviving the employee or Member and alive at the date title to the payment arises in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person:
First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee or Member in a signed and witnessed writing received in the Office before his death. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.


Second, if there is no designated beneficiary, to the widow or widower of the employee or Member.


Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of the employee or Member and descendants of deceased children by representation.


Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of the employee or Member or the survivor of them.


Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the employee or Member.


Sixth, if none of the above, to such other next of kin of the employee or Member as the Office determines to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the employee or Member at the date of his death.



For the purpose of this subsection, “child” includes a natural child and an adopted child, but does not include a stepchild.




(d)
 If an employee or Member dies—
(1)
 without a survivor; or




(2)
 with a survivor or survivors and the right of all survivors terminates before a claim for survivor annuity is filed;





or if a former employee or Member not retired dies, the lump-sum credit shall be paid.


(e)
 If all annuity rights under this subchapter based on the service of a deceased employee or Member terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid.


(f)
 If an annuitant dies, annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid.


(g)
 Annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of an annuitant or survivor annuitant shall be paid to that individual. Annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a survivor annuitant shall be paid in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person:
First, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the survivor annuitant.


Second, if there is no executor or administrator, payment may be made, after 30 days from the date of death of the survivor annuitant, to such next of kin of the survivor annuitant as the Office determines to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the survivor annuitant at the date of his death.




(h)
 Amounts deducted and withheld from the basic pay of an employee or Member from the first day of the first month which begins after he has performed sufficient service (excluding service which the employee or Member elects to eliminate for the purpose of annuity computation under 
section 8339 of this title
) to entitle him to the maximum annuity provided by 
section 8339 of this title
, together with interest on the amounts at the rate of 3 percent a year compounded annually from the date of the deductions to the date of retirement or death, shall be applied toward any deposit due under 
section 8334 of this title
, and any balance not so required is deemed a voluntary contribution for the purpose of 
section 8343 of this title
.


(i)
 An employee who—
(1)
 is separated from the service before 
July 12, 1960
; and




(2)
 continues in the service after 
July 12, 1960
, without break in service of 1 workday or more;





is entitled to the benefits of subsection (h) of this section.


(j)
(1)
(A)
 Payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) may be made only if the spouse, if any, and any former spouse of the employee or Member are notified of the employee or Member’s application.




(B)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which the lump-sum credit shall not be paid without the consent of a spouse or former spouse of the employee or Member where the Office has received such additional information and documentation as the Office may require that—
(i)
 a court order bars payment of the lump-sum credit in order to preserve the court’s ability to award an annuity under section 8341(h) or section 8345(j); or




(ii)
 payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish the entitlement of the spouse or former spouse, under a court order on file with the Office, to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) or to any portion of an annuity under section 8345(j).








(2)
(A)
 Notification of a spouse or former spouse under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Office shall by regulation prescribe.




(B)
 Under the regulations, the Office may provide that paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection may be waived with respect to a spouse or former spouse if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office that the whereabouts of such spouse or former spouse cannot be determined.






(3)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which this subsection shall be applied in any case in which the Office receives two or more such orders or decrees.




 Additional annuities; voluntary contributions
(a)
 Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an employee or Member may voluntarily contribute additional sums in multiples of $25, but the total may not exceed 10 percent of his basic pay for creditable service after 
July 31, 1920
. The voluntary contribution account in each case is the sum of unrefunded contributions, plus interest at 3 percent a year through 
December 31, 1984
, and thereafter at the rate computed under 
section 8334(e) of this title
, compounded annually to—
(1)
 the date of payment under subsection (d) of this section, separation, or transfer to a position in which he does not continue subject to this subchapter, whichever is earliest; or




(2)
 the commencing date fixed for a deferred annuity or date of death, whichever is earlier, in the case of an individual who is separated with title to deferred annuity and does not claim the voluntary contribution account.




(b)
 The voluntary contribution account is used to purchase at retirement an annuity in addition to the annuity otherwise provided. For each $100 in the voluntary contribution account, the additional annuity consists of $7, increased by 20 cents for each full year, if any, the employee or Member is over 55 years of age at the date of retirement.


(c)
 A retiring employee or Member may elect a reduced additional annuity instead of the additional annuity described by subsection (b) of this section and designate in writing an individual to receive after his death an annuity of 50 percent of his reduced additional annuity. The additional annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual designated is younger than the retiring employee or Member. However, the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent.


(d)
 A present or former employee or Member is entitled to be paid the voluntary contribution account if he files application for payment with the Office before receiving an additional annuity. An individual who has been paid the voluntary contribution account may not again deposit additional sums under this section until, after a separation from the service of more than 3 calendar days, he again becomes subject to this subchapter.


(e)
 If a present or former employee or Member not retired dies, the voluntary contribution account is paid under 
section 8342(c) of this title
. If all additional annuities or any right thereto based on the voluntary contribution account of a deceased employee or Member terminate before the total additional annuity paid equals the account, the difference is paid under 
section 8342(c) of this title
.


 Alternative forms of annuities
(a)
 The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which any employee or Member who has a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition may, at the time of retiring under this subchapter (other than under 
section 8337 of this title
), elect annuity benefits under this section instead of any other benefits under this subchapter (including any benefits under 
section 8341 of this title
) based on the service of the employee or Member.


(b)
 Subject to subsection (c), the Office shall by regulation provide for such alternative forms of annuities as the Office considers appropriate, except that among the alternatives offered shall be—
(1)
 an alternative which provides for—
(A)
 payment of the lump-sum credit to the employee or Member; and




(B)
 payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life; and






(2)
 in the case of an employee or Member who is married at the time of retirement, an alternative which provides for—
(A)
 payment of the lump-sum credit to the employee or Member; and




(B)
 payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of a surviving spouse.






(c)
 Each alternative provided for under subsection (b) shall, to the extent practicable, be designed such that the present value of the benefits provided under such alternative (including any lump-sum credit) is actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided the employee or Member under this subchapter, as computed under subsections (a)–(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) of section 8339.


(d)
 An employee or Member who, at the time of retiring under this subchapter—
(1)
 is married, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section unless a waiver is made under 
section 8339(j)(1) of this title
; or




(2)
 has a former spouse, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section if the former spouse is entitled to benefits under section 8341(h) or 8345(j) of this title (based on the service of the employee or Member) under the terms of a decree of divorce or annulment, or a court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any such decree, with respect to which the Office has been duly notified.




(e)
 An employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this subchapter and who makes an election under this section may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of retirement, make the election provided for under section 8339(
o
) of this title, subject to the deposit requirement thereunder.


“(a)
 
In General
.—

section 8420a of title 5
, United States Code, shall be paid in accordance with the schedule under subsection (b) (instead of the schedule which would otherwise apply), if the commencement date of the annuity payable to such employee or Member occurs after

 Annuities and pay on reemployment
(a)
 If an annuitant receiving annuity from the Fund, except—
(1)
 a disability annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of his recovery or restoration of earning capacity;




(2)
 an annuitant whose annuity, based on an involuntary separation (other than an automatic separation or an involuntary separation for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency), is terminated under subsection (b) of this section;




(3)
 an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (c) of this section; or




(4)
 a Member receiving annuity from the Fund;





becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, his service on and after the date he is so employed is covered by this subchapter. Deductions for the Fund may not be withheld from his pay unless the individual elects to have such deductions withheld under subparagraph (A). An amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from his pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under 
section 5551 of this title
. The amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis, except as President, for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, in employment not excluding him from coverage under section 8331(1)(i) or (ii) of this title—


(A)
 deductions for the Fund may be withheld from his pay (if the employee so elects), and his annuity on termination of employment is increased by an annuity computed under section 8339(a), (b), (d), (e), (h), (i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) as may apply based on the period of employment and the basic pay, before deduction, averaged during that employment; and




(B)
 his lump-sum credit may not be reduced by annuity paid during that employment.





If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8339(j) or 
section 8339(k)(2) of this title
, the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A) of this subsection is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity payable under 
section 8341(b) of this title
 is increased by 55 percent of the increase in annuity payable under such subparagraph (A), unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under such subparagraph (A), the annuitant notifies the Office of Personnel Management in writing that he does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, the survivor annuity payable is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated. If the described employment of the annuitant continues for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, he may elect, instead of the benefit provided by subparagraph (A) of this subsection, to deposit in the Fund (to the extent deposits or deductions have not otherwise been made) an amount computed under 
section 8334(c) of this title
 covering that employment and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed and the described employment had continued for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, the person entitled to survivor annuity under 
section 8341(b) of this title
 may elect to deposit in the Fund and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter.


(b)
 If an annuitant, other than a Member receiving an annuity from the Fund, whose annuity is based on an involuntary separation (other than an automatic separation or an involuntary separation for cause or charges on misconduct or delinquency) is reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment.


(c)
 If an annuitant, other than a Member receiving an annuity from the Fund, is appointed by the President to a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, or is elected as a Member, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment. Upon separation from such position, an individual whose annuity is so terminated is entitled to have his rights redetermined under this subchapter, except that the amount of the annuity resulting from such redetermination shall be at least equal to the amount of the terminated annuity plus any increases under 
section 8340 of this title
 occurring after the termination and before the commencement of the redetermined annuity.


(d)
 If a Member receiving annuity from the Fund becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, annuity payments are discontinued during the employment and resumed on termination of the employment in the amount equal to the sum of the amount of the annuity the member was receiving immediately before the commencement of the employment and the amount of the increases which would have been made in the amount of the annuity under 
section 8340 of this title
 during the period of the employment if the annuity had been payable during that period, except that—
(1)
 the retired Member or Member separated with title to immediate or deferred annuity, who serves at any time after separation as a Member in an appointive position in which he is subject to this subchapter, is entitled, if he so elects, to have his Member annuity computed or recomputed as if the service had been performed before his separation as a Member and the annuity as so computed or recomputed is effective—
(A)
 the day Member annuity commences; or




(B)
 the day after the date of separation from the appointive position;





whichever is later;




(2)
 if the retired Member becomes employed after 
December 31, 1958
, in an appointive position on an intermittent-service basis—
(A)
 his annuity continues during the employment and is not increased as a result of service performed during that employment;




(B)
 retirement deductions may not be withheld from his pay;




(C)
 an amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from his pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under 
section 5551 of this title
; and




(D)
 the amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund;






(3)
 if the retired Member becomes employed after 
December 31, 1958
, in an appointive position without pay on a full-time or substantially full-time basis, his annuity continues during the employment and is not increased as a result of service performed during the employment; and




(4)
 if the retired Member takes office as Member and gives notice as provided by 
section 8331(2) of this title
, his service as Member during that period shall be credited in determining his right to and the amount of later annuity.




(e)
 This section does not apply to an individual appointed to serve as a Governor of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service.


(f)
 Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, if an annuitant receiving annuity from the Fund, except a Member receiving annuity from the Fund, becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by 
section 451 of title 28
, annuity payments are discontinued during such employment and are resumed in the same amount upon resignation or retirement from regular active service as such a justice or judge.


(g)
 A former employee or a former Member who becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by 
section 451 of title 28
, may, at any time prior to resignation or retirement from regular active service as such a justice or judge, apply for and be paid, in accordance with 
section 8342(a) of this title
, the amount (if any) by which the lump-sum credit exceeds the total annuity paid, notwithstanding the time limitation contained in such section for filing an application for payment.
