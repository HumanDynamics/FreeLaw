Chapter 81
COMPENSATION FOR WORK INJURIES
 Definitions
 Compensation for disability or death of employee
(a)
 The United States shall pay compensation as specified by this subchapter for the disability or death of an employee resulting from personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty, unless the injury or death is—
(1)
 caused by willful misconduct of the employee;




(2)
 caused by the employee’s intention to bring about the injury or death of himself or of another; or




(3)
 proximately caused by the intoxication of the injured employee.




(b)
 Disability or death from a war-risk hazard or during or as a result of capture, detention, or other restraint by a hostile force or individual, suffered by an employee who is employed outside the continental United States or in Alaska or in the areas and installations in the Republic of Panama made available to the United States pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements (as described in section 3(a) of the Panama Canal Act of 1979), is deemed to have resulted from personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty, whether or not the employee was engaged in the course of employment when the disability or disability resulting in death occurred or when he was taken by the hostile force or individual. This subsection does not apply to an individual—
(1)
 whose residence is at or in the vicinity of the place of his employment and who was not living there solely because of the exigencies of his employment, unless he was injured or taken while engaged in the course of his employment; or




(2)
 who is a prisoner of war or a protected individual under the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and is detained or utilized by the United States.





This subsection does not affect the payment of compensation under this subchapter derived otherwise than under this subsection, but compensation for disability or death does not accrue for a period for which pay, other benefit, or gratuity from the United States accrues to the disabled individual or his dependents on account of detention by the enemy or because of the same disability or death, unless that pay, benefit, or gratuity is refunded or renounced.

The United States shall pay a death gratuity of up to $100,000 to or for the survivor prescribed by subsection (d) immediately upon receiving official notification of the death of an employee who dies of injuries incurred in connection with the employee’s service with an Armed Force in a contingency operation.


(b)
 
Retroactive Payment in Certain Cases
.—
At the discretion of the Secretary concerned, subsection (a) may apply in the case of an employee who died, on or after 
October 7, 2001
, and before the date of enactment of this section, as a result of injuries incurred in connection with the employee’s service with an Armed Force in the theater of operations of Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom.

However, only one father and one mother, or their counterparts in loco parentis, may be recognized in any case, and preference shall be given to those who exercised a parental relationship on the date, or most nearly before the date, on which the decedent became an employee.




(4)
 A person covered by this section may designate another person to receive an amount payable under this section. The designation shall indicate the percentage of the amount, to be specified only in 10 percent increments, that the designated person may receive. The balance of the amount of the death gratuity shall be paid to or for the living survivors of the person concerned in accordance with subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1).

Definitions
.—
(1)
 The term “contingency operation” has the meaning given to that term in 
section 1482a(c) of title 10
, United States Code.




(2)
 The term “employee” has the meaning provided in 
section 8101 of this title
, but also includes a nonappropriated fund instrumentality employee, as defined in

.




 Medical services and initial medical and other benefits
(a)
 The United States shall furnish to an employee who is injured while in the performance of duty, the services, appliances, and supplies prescribed or recommended by a qualified physician, which the Secretary of Labor considers likely to cure, give relief, reduce the degree or the period of disability, or aid in lessening the amount of the monthly compensation. These services, appliances, and supplies shall be furnished—
(1)
 whether or not disability has arisen;




(2)
 notwithstanding that the employee has accepted or is entitled to receive benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title or another retirement system for employees of the Government; and




(3)
 by or on the order of United States medical officers and hospitals, or, at the employee’s option, by or on the order of physicians and hospitals designated or approved by the Secretary.





The employee may initially select a physician to provide medical services, appliances, and supplies, in accordance with such regulations and instructions as the Secretary considers necessary, and may be furnished necessary and reasonable transportation and expenses incident to the securing of such services, appliances, and supplies. These expenses, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, shall be paid from the Employees’ Compensation Fund.


(b)
 The Secretary, under such limitations or conditions as he considers necessary, may authorize the employing agencies to provide for the initial furnishing of medical and other benefits under this section. The Secretary may certify vouchers for these expenses out of the Employees’ Compensation Fund when the immediate superior of the employee certifies that the expense was incurred in respect to an injury which was accepted by the employing agency as probably compensable under this subchapter. The Secretary shall prescribe the form and content of the certificate.


 Vocational rehabilitation
(a)
 The Secretary of Labor may direct a permanently disabled individual whose disability is compensable under this subchapter to undergo vocational rehabilitation. The Secretary shall provide for furnishing the vocational rehabilitation services. In providing for these services, the Secretary, insofar as practicable, shall use the services or facilities of State agencies and corresponding agencies which cooperate with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare in carrying out the purposes of chapter 4 of title 29, except to the extent that the Secretary of Labor provides for furnishing these services under 
section 8103 of this title
. The cost of providing these services to individuals undergoing vocational rehabilitation under this section shall be paid from the Employees’ Compensation Fund. However, in reimbursing a State or corresponding agency under an arrangement pursuant to this section the cost to the agency reimbursable in full under 
section 32(b)(1) of title 29
 is excluded.


(b)
 Notwithstanding section 8106, individuals directed to undergo vocational rehabilitation by the Secretary shall, while undergoing such rehabilitation, receive compensation at the rate provided in sections 8105 and 8110 of this title, less the amount of any earnings received from remunerative employment, other than employment undertaken pursuant to such rehabilitation.


 Total disability
(a)
 If the disability is total, the United States shall pay the employee during the disability monthly monetary compensation equal to 66⅔ percent of his monthly pay, which is known as his basic compensation for total disability.


(b)
 The loss of use of both hands, both arms, both feet, or both legs, or the loss of sight of both eyes, is prima facie permanent total disability.


 Partial disability
(a)
 If the disability is partial, the United States shall pay the employee during the disability monthly monetary compensation equal to 66⅔ percent of the difference between his monthly pay and his monthly wage-earning capacity after the beginning of the partial disability, which is known as his basic compensation for partial disability.


(b)
 The Secretary of Labor may require a partially disabled employee to report his earnings from employment or self-employment, by affidavit or otherwise, in the manner and at the times the Secretary specifies. The employee shall include in the affidavit or report the value of housing, board, lodging, and other advantages which are part of his earnings in employment or self-employment and which can be estimated in money. An employee who—
(1)
 fails to make an affidavit or report when required; or




(2)
 knowingly omits or understates any part of his earnings;





forfeits his right to compensation with respect to any period for which the affidavit or report was required. Compensation forfeited under this subsection, if already paid, shall be recovered by a deduction from the compensation payable to the employee or otherwise recovered under 
section 8129 of this title
, unless recovery is waived under that section.


(c)
 A partially disabled employee who—
(1)
 refuses to seek suitable work; or




(2)
 refuses or neglects to work after suitable work is offered to, procured by, or secured for him;





is not entitled to compensation.


 Compensation schedule
(a)
 If there is permanent disability involving the loss, or loss of use, of a member or function of the body or involving disfigurement, the employee is entitled to basic compensation for the disability, as provided by the schedule in subsection (c) of this section, at the rate of 66⅔ percent of his monthly pay. The basic compensation is—
(1)
 payable regardless of whether the cause of the disability originates in a part of the body other than that member;




(2)
 payable regardless of whether the disability also involves another impairment of the body; and




(3)
 in addition to compensation for temporary total or temporary partial disability.




(b)
 With respect to any period after payments under subsection (a) of this section have ended, an employee is entitled to compensation as provided by—
(1)
 
section 8105 of this title
 if the disability is total; or




(2)
 
section 8106 of this title
 if the disability is partial.




(c)
 The compensation schedule is as follows:
(1)
 Arm lost, 312 weeks’ compensation.




(2)
 Leg lost, 288 weeks’ compensation.




(3)
 Hand lost, 244 weeks’ compensation.




(4)
 Foot lost, 205 weeks’ compensation.

(7)
 First finger lost, 46 weeks’ compensation.




(8)
 Great toe lost, 38 weeks’ compensation.




(9)
 Second finger lost, 30 weeks’ compensation.




(10)
 Third finger lost, 25 weeks’ compensation.




(11)
 Toe other than great toe lost, 16 weeks’ compensation.




(12)
 Fourth finger lost, 15 weeks’ compensation.




(13)
 Loss of hearing—
(A)
 complete loss of hearing of one ear, 52 weeks’ compensation; or




(B)
 complete loss of hearing of both ears, 200 weeks’ compensation.






(14)
 Compensation for loss of binocular vision or for loss of 80 percent or more of the vision of an eye is the same as for loss of the eye.




(15)
 Compensation for loss of more than one phalanx of a digit is the same as for loss of the entire digit. Compensation for loss of the first phalanx is one-half of the compensation for loss of the entire digit.




(16)
 If, in the case of an arm or a leg, the member is amputated above the wrist or ankle, compensation is the same as for loss of the arm or leg, respectively.




(17)
 Compensation for loss of use of two or more digits, or one or more phalanges of each of two or more digits, of a hand or foot, is proportioned to the loss of use of the hand or foot occasioned thereby.




(18)
 Compensation for permanent total loss of use of a member is the same as for loss of the member.




(19)
 Compensation for permanent partial loss of use of a member may be for proportionate loss of use of the member. The degree of loss of vision or hearing under this schedule is determined without regard to correction.




(20)
 In case of loss of use of more than one member or parts of more than one member as enumerated by this schedule, the compensation is for loss of use of each member or part thereof, and the awards run consecutively. However, when the injury affects only two or more digits of the same hand or foot, paragraph (17) of this subsection applies, and when partial bilateral loss of hearing is involved, compensation is computed on the loss as affecting both ears.




(21)
 For serious disfigurement of the face, head, or neck of a character likely to handicap an individual in securing or maintaining employment, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed $3,500 shall be awarded in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.




(22)
 For permanent loss or loss of use of any other important external or internal organ of the body as determined by the Secretary, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed 312 weeks’ compensation for each organ so determined shall be paid in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.




 Reduction of compensation for subsequent injury to same member
 Beneficiaries of awards unpaid at death; order of precedence
(a)
 If an individual—
(1)
 has sustained disability compensable under 
section 8107(a) of this title
;




(2)
 has filed a valid claim in his lifetime; and




(3)
 dies from a cause other than the injury before the end of the period specified by the schedule;





the compensation specified by the schedule that is unpaid at his death, whether or not accrued or due at his death, shall be paid—


(A)
 under an award made before or after the death;




(B)
 for the period specified by the schedule;




(C)
 to and for the benefit of the persons then in being within the classes and proportions and on the conditions specified by this section; and




(D)
 in the following order of precedence:
(i)
 If there is no child, to the widow or widower.




(ii)
 If there are both a widow or widower and a child or children, one-half to the widow or widower and one-half to the child or children.




(iii)
 If there is no widow or widower, to the child or children.




(iv)
 If there is no survivor in the above classes, to the parent or parents wholly or partly dependent for support on the decedent, or to other wholly dependent relatives listed by 
section 8133(a)(5) of this title
, or to both in proportions provided by regulation.




(v)
 If there is no survivor in the above classes and no burial allowance is payable under 
section 8134 of this title
, an amount not exceeding that which would be expendable under 
section 8134 of this title
 if applicable shall be paid to reimburse a person equitably entitled thereto to the extent and in the proportion that he has paid the burial expenses, but a compensated insurer or other person obligated by law or contract to pay the burial expenses or a State or political subdivision or entity is deemed not equitably entitled.






(b)
 Payments under subsection (a) of this section, except for an amount payable for a period preceding the death of the individual, are at the basic rate of compensation for permanent disability specified by 
section 8107(a) of this title
 even if at the time of death the individual was entitled to the augmented rate specified by 
section 8110 of this title
.


(c)
 A surviving beneficiary under subsection (a) of this section, except one under subsection (a)(D)(v), does not have a vested right to payment and must be alive to receive payment.


(d)
 A beneficiary under subsection (a) of this section, except one under subsection (a)(D)(v), ceases to be entitled to payment on the happening of an event which would terminate his right to compensation for death under 
section 8133 of this title
. When that entitlement ceases, compensation remaining unpaid under subsection (a) of this section is payable to the surviving beneficiary in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.


 Augmented compensation for dependents
(a)
 For the purpose of this section, “dependent” means—
(1)
 a wife, if—
(A)
 she is a member of the same household as the employee;




(B)
 she is receiving regular contributions from the employee for her support; or




(C)
 the employee has been ordered by a court to contribute to her support;






(2)
 a husband, if—
(A)
 he is a member of the same household as the employee; or




(B)
 he is receiving regular contributions from the employee for his support; or




(C)
 the employee has been ordered by a court to contribute to his support;






(3)
 an unmarried child, while living with the employee or receiving regular contributions from the employee toward his support, and who is—
(A)
 under 18 years of age; or




(B)
 over 18 years of age and incapable of self-support because of physical or mental disability; and






(4)
 a parent, while wholly dependent on and supported by the employee.





Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this subsection, compensation payable for a child that would otherwise end because the child has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by 
section 8101 of this title
 at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries.


(b)
 A disabled employee with one or more dependents is entitled to have his basic compensation for disability augmented—
(1)
 at the rate of 8⅓ percent of his monthly pay if that compensation is payable under section 8105 or 8107(a) of this title; and




(2)
 at the rate of 8⅓ percent of the difference between his monthly pay and his monthly wage-earning capacity if that compensation is payable under 
section 8106(a) of this title
.




 Additional compensation for services of attendants or vocational rehabilitation
(a)
 The Secretary of Labor may pay an employee who has been awarded compensation an additional sum of not more than $1,500 a month, as the Secretary considers necessary, when the Secretary finds that the service of an attendant is necessary constantly because the employee is totally blind, or has lost the use of both hands or both feet, or is paralyzed and unable to walk, or because of other disability resulting from the injury making him so helpless as to require constant attendance.


(b)
 The Secretary may pay an individual undergoing vocational rehabilitation under 
section 8104 of this title
 additional compensation necessary for his maintenance, but not to exceed $200 a month.


 Maximum and minimum monthly payments
(a)
 Except as provided by 
section 8138 of this title
, the monthly rate of compensation for disability, including augmented compensation under 
section 8110 of this title
 but not including additional compensation under 
section 8111 of this title
, may not be more than 75 percent of the monthly pay of the maximum rate of basic pay for GS–15, and in case of total disability may not be less than 75 percent of the monthly pay of the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–2 or the amount of the monthly pay of the employee, whichever is less.


(b)
 The provisions of subsection (a) shall not apply to any employee whose disability is a result of an assault which occurs during an assassination or attempted assassination of a Federal official described under section 351(a) or 1751(a) of title 18, and was sustained in the performance of duty.


 Increase or decrease of basic compensation
(a)
 If an individual—
(1)
 was a minor or employed in a learner’s capacity at the time of injury; and




(2)
 was not physically or mentally handicapped before the injury;





the Secretary of Labor, on review under 
section 8128 of this title
 after the time the wage-earning capacity of the individual would probably have increased but for the injury, shall recompute prospectively the monetary compensation payable for disability on the basis of an assumed monthly pay corresponding to the probable increased wage-earning capacity.


(b)
 If an individual without good cause fails to apply for and undergo vocational rehabilitation when so directed under 
section 8104 of this title
, the Secretary, on review under 
section 8128 of this title
 and after finding that in the absence of the failure the wage-earning capacity of the individual would probably have substantially increased, may reduce prospectively the monetary compensation of the individual in accordance with what would probably have been his wage-earning capacity in the absence of the failure, until the individual in good faith complies with the direction of the Secretary.


 Computation of pay
(a)
 For the purpose of this section—
(1)
 “overtime pay” means pay for hours of service in excess of a statutory or other basic workweek or other basic unit of worktime, as observed by the employing establishment; and




(2)
 “year” means a period of 12 calendar months, or the equivalent thereof as specified by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.




(b)
 In computing monetary compensation for disability or death on the basis of monthly pay, that pay is determined under this section.


(c)
 The monthly pay at the time of injury is deemed one-twelfth of the average annual earnings of the employee at that time. When compensation is paid on a weekly basis, the weekly equivalent of the monthly pay is deemed one-fifty-second of the average annual earnings. However, for so much of a period of total disability as does not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the beginning of compensable disability, the compensation, in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, may be computed on the basis of the actual daily wage of the employee at the time of injury in which event he may be paid compensation for the days he would have worked but for the injury.


(d)
 Average annual earnings are determined as follows:
(1)
 If the employee worked in the employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury and the employment was in a position for which an annual rate of pay—
(A)
 was fixed, the average annual earnings are the annual rate of pay; or




(B)
 was not fixed, the average annual earnings are the product obtained by multiplying his daily wage for the particular employment, or the average thereof if the daily wage has fluctuated, by 300 if he was employed on the basis of a 6-day workweek, 280 if employed on the basis of a 5½-day week, and 260 if employed on the basis of a 5-day week.






(2)
 If the employee did not work in employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury, but the position was one which would have afforded employment for substantially a whole year, the average annual earnings are a sum equal to the average annual earnings of an employee of the same class working substantially the whole immediately preceding year in the same or similar employment by the United States in the same or neighboring place, as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection.




(3)
 If either of the foregoing methods of determining the average annual earnings cannot be applied reasonably and fairly, the average annual earnings are a sum that reasonably represents the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury having regard to the previous earnings of the employee in Federal employment, and of other employees of the United States in the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring location, other previous employment of the employee, or other relevant factors. However, the average annual earnings may not be less than 150 times the average daily wage the employee earned in the employment during the days employed within 1 year immediately preceding his injury.




(4)
 If the employee served without pay or at nominal pay, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection apply as far as practicable, but the average annual earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS–15. If the average annual earnings cannot be determined reasonably and fairly in the manner otherwise provided by this section, the average annual earnings shall be determined at the reasonable value of the service performed but not in excess of $3,600 a year.




(e)
 The value of subsistence and quarters, and of any other form of remuneration in kind for services if its value can be estimated in money, and premium pay under 
section 5545(c)(1) of this title
 are included as part of the pay, but account is not taken of—
(1)
 overtime pay;




(2)
 additional pay or allowance authorized outside the United States because of differential in cost of living or other special circumstances; or




(3)
 bonus or premium pay for extraordinary service including bonus or pay for particularly hazardous service in time of war.




 Determination of wage-earning capacity
(a)
 In determining compensation for partial disability, except permanent partial disability compensable under sections 8107–8109 of this title, the wage-earning capacity of an employee is determined by his actual earnings if his actual earnings fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity. If the actual earnings of the employee do not fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity or if the employee has no actual earnings, his wage-earning capacity as appears reasonable under the circumstances is determined with due regard to—
(1)
 the nature of his injury;




(2)
 the degree of physical impairment;




(3)
 his usual employment;




(4)
 his age;




(5)
 his qualifications for other employment;




(6)
 the availability of suitable employment; and




(7)
 other factors or circumstances which may affect his wage-earning capacity in his disabled condition.




(b)
 
Section 8114(d) of this title
 is applicable in determining the wage-earning capacity of an employee after the beginning of partial disability.


 Limitations on right to receive compensation
(a)
 While an employee is receiving compensation under this subchapter, or if he has been paid a lump sum in commutation of installment payments until the expiration of the period during which the installment payments would have continued, he may not receive salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States, except—
(1)
 in return for service actually performed;




(2)
 pension for service in the Army, Navy, or Air Force;




(3)
 other benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs unless such benefits are payable for the same injury or the same death; and




(4)
 retired pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or equivalent pay for service in the Armed Forces or other uniformed services.





However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title, or another retirement system for employees of the Government, does not impair the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by 
section 8107(c) of this title
.


(b)
 An individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter because of his injury, or because of the death of an employee, who also is entitled to receive from the United States under a provision of statute other than this subchapter payments or benefits for that injury or death (except proceeds of an insurance policy), because of service by him (or in the case of death, by the deceased) as an employee or in the armed forces, shall elect which benefits he will receive. The individual shall make the election within 1 year after the injury or death or within a further time allowed for good cause by the Secretary of Labor. The election when made is irrevocable, except as otherwise provided by statute.


(c)
 The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen’s compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute. However, this subsection does not apply to a master or a member of a crew of a vessel.


(d)
 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, an individual receiving benefits for disability or death under this subchapter who is also receiving benefits under subchapter III of chapter 84 of this title or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall be entitled to all such benefits, except that—
(1)
 benefits received under section 223 of the Social Security Act (on account of disability) shall be subject to reduction on account of benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to the provisions of section 224 of the Social Security Act; and




(2)
 in the case of benefits received on account of age or death under title II of the Social Security Act, compensation payable under this subchapter based on the Federal service of an employee shall be reduced by the amount of any such social security benefits payable that are attributable to Federal service of that employee covered by chapter 84 of this title. However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under chapter 84 of this title, or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act by virtue of service covered by chapter 84 of this title, does not affect the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by 
section 8107(c) of this title
.




 Time of accrual of right
(a)
 An employee other than a Postal Service employee is not entitled to compensation for the first 3 days of temporary disability, except—
(1)
 when the disability exceeds 14 days;




(2)
 when the disability is followed by permanent disability; or




(3)
 as provided by sections 8103 and 8104 of this title.




(b)
 A Postal Service employee is not entitled to compensation or continuation of pay for the first 3 days of temporary disability, except as provided under paragraph (3) of subsection (a). A Postal Service employee may use annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay during that 3-day period, except that if the disability exceeds 14 days or is followed by permanent disability, the employee may have their sick leave or annual leave reinstated or receive pay for the time spent on leave without pay under this section.


 Continuation of pay; election to use annual or sick leave
(a)
 The United States shall authorize the continuation of pay of an employee, as defined in 
section 8101(1) of this title
 (other than those referred to in clause (B) or (E), who has filed a claim for a period of wage loss due to a traumatic injury with his immediate superior on a form approved by the Secretary of Labor within the time specified in 
section 8122(a)(2) of this title
.


(b)
 Continuation of pay under this subchapter shall be furnished—
(1)
 without a break in time, except as provided under section 8117(b), unless controverted under regulations of the Secretary;




(2)
 for a period not to exceed 45 days; and




(3)
 under accounting procedures and such other regulations as the Secretary may require.

 Report of injury
 Claim
 Time for making claim

 An employee shall submit to examination by a medical officer of the United States, or by a physician designated or approved by the Secretary of Labor, after the injury and as frequently and at the times and places as may be reasonably required. The employee may have a physician designated and paid by him present to participate in the examination. If there is disagreement between the physician making the examination for the United States and the physician of the employee, the Secretary shall appoint a third physician who shall make an examination.


(b)
 An employee is entitled to be paid expenses incident to an examination required by the Secretary which in the opinion of the Secretary are necessary and reasonable, including transportation and loss of wages incurred in order to be examined. The expenses, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, are paid from the Employees’ Compensation Fund.


(c)
 The Secretary shall fix the fees for examinations held under this section by physicians not employed by or under contract to the United States to furnish medical services to employees. The fees, when authorized or approved by the Secretary, are paid from the Employees’ Compensation Fund.

(1)
 considering the claim presented by the beneficiary and the report furnished by the immediate superior; and

(b)
(1)
 Before review under 
section 8128(a) of this title

At the hearing, the claimant is entitled to present evidence in further support of his claim. Within 30 days after the hearing ends, the Secretary shall notify the claimant in writing of his further decision and any modifications of the award he may make and of the basis of his decision.




(2)
 In conducting the hearing, the representative of the Secretary is not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence, by technical or formal rules of procedure, or by 
section 554 of this title
 except as provided by this subchapter, but may conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant. For this purpose, he shall receive such relevant evidence as the claimant adduces and such other evidence as he determines necessary or useful in evaluating the claim.

Credit shall be allowed in the accounts of a certifying or disbursing official for payments in accordance with that action.


 Recovery of overpayments
(a)
 When an overpayment has been made to an individual under this subchapter because of an error of fact or law, adjustment shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor by decreasing later payments to which the individual is entitled. If the individual dies before the adjustment is completed, adjustment shall be made by decreasing later benefits payable under this subchapter with respect to the individual’s death.


(b)
 Adjustment or recovery by the United States may not be made when incorrect payment has been made to an individual who is without fault and when adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.


(c)
 A certifying or disbursing official is not liable for an amount certified or paid by him when—
(1)
 adjustment or recovery of the amount is waived under subsection (b) of this section; or




(2)
 adjustment under subsection (a) of this section is not completed before the death of all individuals against whose benefits deductions are authorized.




 Assignment of claim
An assignment of a claim for compensation under this subchapter is void. Compensation and claims for compensation are exempt from claims of creditors.
 Subrogation of the United States
(a)
 If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability on a person other than the United States to pay damages, the Secretary of Labor may require the beneficiary to—
(1)
 assign to the United States any right of action he may have to enforce the liability or any right he may have to share in money or other property received in satisfaction of that liability; or




(2)
 prosecute the action in his own name.





An employee required to appear as a party or witness in the prosecution of such an action is in an active duty status while so engaged.


(b)
 A beneficiary who refuses to assign or prosecute an action in his own name when required by the Secretary is not entitled to compensation under this subchapter.


(c)
 The Secretary may prosecute or compromise a cause of action assigned to the United States. When the Secretary realizes on the cause of action, he shall deduct therefrom and place to the credit of the Employees’ Compensation Fund the amount of compensation already paid to the beneficiary and the expense of realization or collection. Any surplus shall be paid to the beneficiary and credited on future payments of compensation payable for the same injury. However, the beneficiary is entitled to not less than one-fifth of the net amount of a settlement or recovery remaining after the expenses thereof have been deducted.


(d)
 If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in the Panama Canal Company to pay damages under the law of a State, a territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or a foreign country, compensation is not payable until the individual entitled to compensation—
(1)
 releases to the Panama Canal Company any right of action he may have to enforce the liability of the Panama Canal Company; or




(2)
 assigns to the United States any right he may have to share in money or other property received in satisfaction of the liability of the Panama Canal Company.




 Adjustment after recovery from a third person
If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the United States to pay damages, and a beneficiary entitled to compensation from the United States for that injury or death receives money or other property in satisfaction of that liability as the result of suit or settlement by him or in his behalf, the beneficiary, after deducting therefrom the costs of suit and a reasonable attorney’s fee, shall refund to the United States the amount of compensation paid by the United States and credit any surplus on future payments of compensation payable to him for the same injury. No court, insurer, attorney, or other person shall pay or distribute to the beneficiary or his designee the proceeds of such suit or settlement without first satisfying or assuring satisfaction of the interest of the United States. The amount refunded to the United States shall be credited to the Employees’ Compensation Fund. If compensation has not been paid to the beneficiary, he shall credit the money or property on compensation payable to him by the United States for the same injury. However, the beneficiary is entitled to retain, as a minimum, at least one-fifth of the net amount of the money or other property remaining after the expenses of a suit or settlement have been deducted; and in addition to this minimum and at the time of distribution, an amount equivalent to a reasonable attorney’s fee proportionate to the refund to the United States.
 Compensation in case of death
(a)
 If death results from an injury sustained in the performance of duty, the United States shall pay a monthly compensation equal to a percentage of the monthly pay of the deceased employee in accordance with the following schedule:
(1)
 To the widow or widower, if there is no child, 50 percent.




(2)
 To the widow or widower, if there is a child, 45 percent and in addition 15 percent for each child not to exceed a total of 75 percent for the widow or widower and children.

 To the children, if there is no widow or widower, 40 percent for one child and 15 percent additional for each additional child not to exceed a total of 75 percent, divided among the children share and share alike.




(4)
 To the parents, if there is no widow, widower, or child, as follows—
(A)
 25 percent if one parent was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death and the other was not dependent to any extent;




(B)
 20 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; or




(C)
 a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor if one or both were partly dependent.





If there is a widow, widower, or child, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, and children, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.




(5)
 To the brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren, if there is no widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, as follows—
(A)
 20 percent if one was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death;




(B)
 30 percent if more than one was wholly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike; or




(C)
 10 percent if no one is wholly dependent but one or more is partly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike.





If there is a widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, children, and dependent parents, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.

(3)
 a parent or grandparent dies, marries, or ceases to be dependent.





Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, compensation payable to or for a child, a brother or sister, or grandchild that would otherwise end because the child, brother or sister, or grandchild has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by 
section 8101 of this title
 at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries. A widow or widower who has entitlements to benefits under this title derived from more than one husband or wife shall elect one entitlement to be utilized.


(c)
 On the cessation of compensation under this section to or on account of an individual, the compensation of the remaining individuals entitled to compensation for the unexpired part of the period during which their compensation is payable, is that which they would have received if they had been the only individuals entitled to compensation at the time of the death of the employee.


(d)
 When there are two or more classes of individuals entitled to compensation under this section and the apportionment of compensation under this section would result in injustice, the Secretary may modify the apportionment to meet the requirements of the case.

section 8114 of this title
, except for increases authorized by 
section 8146a of this title
; or




(2)
 75 percent of the monthly pay of the maximum rate of basic pay for GS–15.

 Lump-sum payment
(a)
 The liability of the United States for compensation to a beneficiary in the case of death or of permanent total or permanent partial disability may be discharged by a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of all future payments of compensation computed at 4 percent true discount compounded annually if—
(1)
 the monthly payment to the beneficiary is less than $50 a month;




(2)
 the beneficiary is or is about to become a nonresident of the United States; or




(3)
 the Secretary of Labor determines that it is for the best interest of the beneficiary.





The probability of the death of the beneficiary before the expiration of the period during which he is entitled to compensation shall be determined according to the most current United States Life Tables, as developed by the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, which shall be updated from time to time, but the lump-sum payment to a widow or widower of the deceased employee may not exceed 60 months’ compensation. The probability of the happening of any other contingency affecting the amount or duration of compensation shall be disregarded.


(b)

 Compensation for noncitizens and nonresidents
(a)
 When the Secretary of Labor finds that the amount of compensation payable to an employee who is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States or Canada, or payable to a dependent of such an employee, is substantially disproportionate to compensation for disability or death payable in similar cases under local statute, regulation, custom, or otherwise at the place outside the continental United States or Canada where the employee is working at the time of injury, he may provide for payment of compensation on a basis reasonably in accord with prevailing local payments in similar cases by—
(1)
 the adoption or adaption of the substantive features, by a schedule or otherwise, of local workmen’s compensation provisions or other local statute, regulation, or custom applicable in cases of personal injury or death; or




(2)
 establishing special schedules of compensation for injury, death, and loss of use of members and functions of the body for specific classes of employees, areas, and places.

 modify, limit, or redesignate the class or classes of beneficiaries entitled to death benefits, including the designation of persons, representatives, or groups entitled to payment under local statute or custom whether or not included in the classes of beneficiaries otherwise specified by this subchapter.




(b)

(1)
 make a lump-sum award in the manner prescribed by 
section 8135 of this title
 when he or his designee considers it to be for the best interest of the United States; and




(2)
 compromise and pay a claim for benefits, including a claim in which there is a dispute as to jurisdiction or other fact or a question of law.





Compensation paid under this subsection is instead of all other compensation from the United States for the same injury or death, and a payment made under this subsection is deemed compensation under this subchapter and is satisfaction of all liability of the United States in respect to the particular injury or death.


(c)
 The Secretary may delegate to an employee or agency of the United States, with such limitations and right of review as he considers advisable, authority to process, adjudicate, commute by lump-sum award, compromise, and pay a claim or class of claims for compensation, and to provide other benefits, locally, under this section, in accordance with such regulations and instructions as the Secretary considers necessary. For this purpose, the Secretary may provide or transfer funds, including reimbursement of amounts paid under this subchapter.


(d)

(1)
 conditions prevent the establishment of facilities for processing and adjudicating claims under this section; or
