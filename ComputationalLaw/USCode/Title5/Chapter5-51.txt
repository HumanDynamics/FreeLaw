 The Office of Personnel Management, after consulting the agencies, shall prepare standards for placing positions in their proper classes and grades. The Office may make such inquiries or investigations of the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements of positions as it considers necessary for this purpose. The agencies, on request of the Office, shall furnish information for and cooperate in the preparation of the standards.

 Basis for classifying positions
(a)
 Each position shall be placed in its appropriate class. The basis for determining the appropriate class is the duties and responsibilities of the position and the qualifications required by the duties and responsibilities.


(b)
 Each class shall be placed in its appropriate grade. The basis for determining the appropriate grade is the level of difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements of the work of the class.


(c)
 Appropriated funds may not be used to pay an employee who places a supervisory position in a class and grade solely on the basis of the size of the organization unit or the number of subordinates supervised. These factors may be given effect only to the extent warranted by the work load of the organization unit and then only in combination with other factors, such as the kind, difficulty, and complexity of work supervised, the degree and scope of responsibility delegated to the supervisor, and the kind, degree, and character of the supervision exercised.


 Classification of positions
Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, each agency shall place each position under its jurisdiction in its appropriate class and grade in conformance with standards published by the Office of Personnel Management or, if no published standards apply directly, consistently with published standards. When facts warrant, an agency may change a position which it has placed in a class or grade under this section from that class or grade to another class or grade. Subject to subchapter VI of chapter 53 of this title, these actions of an agency are the basis for pay and personnel transactions until changed by certificate of the Office.
 Classification of positions above GS–15
(a)
 The Office of Personnel Management may, for any Executive agency—
(1)
 establish, and from time to time revise, the maximum number of positions which may at any one time be classified above GS–15; and




(2)
 establish standards and procedures published by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in such form as the Director may determine (including requiring agencies, where necessary in the judgment of the Office, to obtain the prior approval of the Office) in accordance with which positions may be classified above GS–15.




(b)
 The President, rather than the Office, shall exercise the authority under subsection (a) in the case of positions proposed to be placed in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive Service.


(c)
 The Librarian of Congress may classify positions in the Library of Congress above GS–15 pursuant to standards established by the Office in subsection (a)(2).


 Positions classified by statute
(a)
 The position held by an employee of the Department of Agriculture while he, under 
section 450d of title 7
, is designated and vested with a delegated regulatory function or part thereof shall be classified in accordance with this chapter, but not lower than GS–14.


(b)
(1)
 The position held by a fully experienced and qualified railroad safety inspector of the Department of Transportation shall be classified in accordance with this chapter, but not lower than GS–12.




(2)
 The position held by a railroad safety specialist of the Department shall be classified in accordance with this chapter, but not lower than GS–13.




 Review of classification of positions
(a)
 The Office of Personnel Management, from time to time, shall review such number of positions in each agency as will enable the Office to determine whether the agency is placing positions in classes and grades in conformance with or consistently with published standards.


(b)
 When the Office finds under subsection (a) of this section that a position is not placed in its proper class and grade in conformance with published standards or that a position for which there is no published standard is not placed in the class and grade consistently with published standards, it shall, after consultation with appropriate officials of the agency concerned, place the position in its appropriate class and grade and shall certify this action to the agency. The agency shall act in accordance with the certificate, and the certificate is binding on all administrative, certifying, payroll, disbursing, and accounting officials.


 Revocation and restoration of authority to classify positions
(a)
 When the Office of Personnel Management finds that an agency is not placing positions in classes and grades in conformance with or consistently with published standards, it may revoke or suspend the authority granted to the agency by 
section 5107 of this title
 and require that prior approval of the Office be secured before an action placing a position in a class and grade becomes effective for payroll and other personnel purposes. The Office may limit the revocation or suspension to—
(1)
 the departmental or field service, or any part thereof;




(2)
 a geographic area;




(3)
 an organization unit or group of organization units;




(4)
 certain types of classification actions;




(5)
 classes in particular occupational groups or grades; or




(6)
 classes for which standards have not been published.




(b)
 After revocation or suspension, the Office may restore the authority to the extent that it is satisfied that later actions placing positions in classes and grades will be in conformance with or consistent with published standards.


 General authority of the Office of Personnel Management
(a)
 Notwithstanding 
section 5107 of this title
, the Office of Personnel Management may—
(1)
 ascertain currently the facts as to the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements of a position;

 place in an appropriate class and grade a newly created position or a position coming initially under this chapter;




(3)
 decide whether a position is in its appropriate class and grade; and




(4)
 change a position from one class or grade to another class or grade when the facts warrant.





The Office shall certify to the agency concerned its action under paragraph (2) or (4) of this subsection. The agency shall act in accordance with the certificate, and the certificate is binding on all administrative, certifying, payroll, disbursing, and accounting officials.


(b)
 An employee affected or an agency may request at any time that the Office exercise the authority granted to it by subsection (a) of this section and the Office shall act on the request.
