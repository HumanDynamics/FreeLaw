(f)
(1)
 An employee or Member who has received a refund of retirement deductions under subchapter III of chapter 83 with respect to any service described in subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) may not be allowed credit for such service under this chapter unless such employee or Member deposits an amount equal to 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service, with interest. A deposit under this paragraph may be made only with respect to a refund received pursuant to an application filed with the Office before the date on which the employee or Member first becomes subject to this chapter.




(2)
 An employee or Member may not be allowed credit under this chapter for any service described in subsection (b)(3) for which retirement deductions under subchapter III of chapter 83 have not been made, unless such employee or Member deposits an amount equal to 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service, with interest.

(h)
 An employee or Member shall be allowed credit for service as a volunteer or volunteer leader under part A of title VIII of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as a full-time volunteer enrolled in a program of at least 1 year’s duration under part A, B,

 The annuity of a Member who has served in a position in the executive branch for which the rate of basic pay was reduced for the duration of the service of the Member in that position to remove the impediment to the appointment of the Member imposed by article I, section 6, clause 2 of the Constitution, shall, subject to a deposit in the Fund as provided under section 8422(g), be computed as though the rate of basic pay which would otherwise have been in effect during that period of service had been in effect.


(k)
(1)
 For purposes of this subsection, the term “physicians comparability allowance” refers to an amount described in section 8331(3)(H).




(2)
 Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no part of a physicians comparability allowance shall be treated as basic pay for purposes of any computation under this section unless, before the date of the separation on which entitlement to annuity is based, the separating individual has completed at least 15 years of service as a Government physician (whether performed before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection).




(3)
 If the condition under paragraph (2) is met, then, any amounts received by the individual in the form of a physicians comparability allowance shall (for the purposes referred to in paragraph (2)) be treated as basic pay, but only to the extent that such amounts are attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, and only to the extent of the percentage allowable, which shall be determined as follows:














If the total amount of service performed, on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, as a Government physician is:
Then, the percentage allowable is:






Less than 2 years
0


At least 2 but less than 4 years
25


At least 4 but less than 6 years
50


At least 6 but less than 8 years
75


At least 8 years
100.










(4)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, 100 percent of all amounts received as a physicians comparability allowance shall, to the extent attributable to service performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, be treated as basic pay (without regard to any of the preceding provisions of this subsection) for purposes of computing—
(A)
 an annuity under section 8452; and




(B)
 a survivor annuity under subchapter IV, if based on the service of an individual who dies before separating from service.






(l)
 The annuity of an employee retiring under this chapter with service credited under section 8411(b)(6) shall be reduced by the amount necessary to ensure that the present value of the annuity payable to the employee under this subchapter is actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity that would be payable to the employee under this subchapter if it were computed—
(1)
 on the basis of service that does not include service credited under section 8411(b)(6); and




(2)
 assuming the employee separated from service on the actual date of the separation of the employee.





The amount of the reduction shall be computed under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for the administration of this subsection.


(m)
(1)
 In computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires from the position of a registered nurse with the Veterans Health Administration on an immediate annuity, or dies while employed in that position leaving any survivor entitled to an annuity, includes the days of unused sick leave to the credit of that employee under a formal leave system, except that such days shall not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter.




(2)
(A)
 Except as provided in paragraph (1), in computing an annuity under this subchapter, the total service of an employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes the applicable percentage of the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system and for which days the employee has not received payment, except that these days will not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter. For purposes of this subsection, in the case of any such employee who is excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 under section 6301(2)(x) through (xiii), the days of unused sick leave to his credit include any unused sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from such subchapter.




(B)
 For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term “applicable percentage” means—
(i)
 50 percent in the case of an annuity, entitlement to which is based on a death or other separation occurring during the period beginning on the date of enactment of this paragraph and ending on 
December 31, 2013
; and




(ii)
 100 percent in the case of an annuity, entitlement to which is based on a death or other separation occurring after 
December 31, 2013
.








(n)
 In the case of any annuity computation under this section that includes, in the aggregate, at least 2 months of credit under section 8411(d) for any period while receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81, the percentage otherwise applicable under this section for that period so credited shall be increased by 1 percentage point.


 Survivor reduction for a current spouse
(a)
(1)
 If an employee or Member is married at the time of retiring under this chapter, the reduction described in section 8419(a) shall be made unless the employee or Member and the spouse jointly waive, by written election, any right which the spouse may have to a survivor annuity under section 8442 based on the service of such employee or Member. A waiver under this paragraph shall be filed with the Office under procedures prescribed by the Office.




(2)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this chapter may waive the annuity for a surviving spouse without the spouse’s consent if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office)—
(A)
 that the spouse’s whereabouts cannot be determined; or




(B)
 that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse’s consent would otherwise be inappropriate.






(3)
 Except as provided in subsection (d), a waiver made under this subsection shall be irrevocable.




(b)
(1)
 Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement (including an employee or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee’s or Member’s spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement) may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such remarriage or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the employee’s or Member’s annuity under section 8419(a) for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee’s or Member’s spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.




(2)
 The election and reduction shall be effective the first day of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage.




(3)
 An election to provide a survivor annuity to an individual under this subsection—
(A)
 shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to such individual; or




(B)
 shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to a different individual, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subsection.






(4)
 Any election under this subsection made by an employee or Member on behalf of an individual after the retirement of such employee or Member shall not be effective if—
(A)
 the employee or Member was married to such individual at the time of retirement; and




(B)
 the annuity rights of such individual based on the service of such employee or Member were then waived under subsection (a).






(c)
(1)
 An employee or Member who is unmarried at the time of retiring under this chapter and who later marries may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such employee or Member marries or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the current annuity of the retired employee or Member, in accordance with section 8419(a).




(2)
 The election and reduction shall take effect the first day of the first month beginning 9 months after the date of marriage. Any such election to provide a survivor annuity for an individual—
(A)
 shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to such individual; or




(B)
 shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to a different individual, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subsection.






(d)
(1)
 An employee or Member—
(A)
 who is married on the date of retiring under this chapter, and




(B)
 with respect to whose spouse a waiver under subsection (a) has been made,





may, during the 18-month period beginning on such date, elect to have a reduction made under section 8419 in order to provide a survivor annuity under section 8442 for such spouse.




(2)
(A)
 An election under this subsection shall not be effective unless the amount described in subparagraph (B) is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the 18-month period referred to in paragraph (1).




(B)
 The amount to be deposited under this subparagraph is equal to the sum of—
(i)
 the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the former employee or Member commences and the date on which reductions pursuant to the election under this subsection commence) between the amount paid to the former employee or Member from the Fund under this chapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time of retirement; and




(ii)
 the costs associated with providing for the election under this subsection.





The amount to be deposited under clause (i) shall include interest, computed at the rate of 6 percent a year.






(3)
 An annuity which is reduced pursuant to an election by a former employee or Member under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage as was in effect under section 8419 as of the date of the employee’s or Member’s retirement.




(4)
 Rights and obligations under this chapter resulting from an election under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the election been made at the time of retirement.




(5)
 The Office shall inform each employee and Member who is eligible to make an election under this subsection of the right to make such election and the procedures and deadlines applicable in making any such election.




 Survivor reduction for a former spouse
(a)
 If an employee or Member has a former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity as provided in section 8445, the reduction described in section 8419(a) shall be made.


(b)
(1)
 An employee or Member who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Office, a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member under section 8419(a) in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under section 8445.




(2)
 An election under this subsection shall be made at the time of retirement or, if the marriage is dissolved after the date of retirement, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is so dissolved.




(3)
 An election under this subsection—
(A)
 shall not be effective to the extent that it—
(i)
 conflicts with—
(I)
 any court order or decree referred to in section 8445(a) which was issued before the date of such election; or




(II)
 any agreement referred to in such section 8445(a) which was entered into before such date; or






(ii)
 would cause the total of survivor annuities payable under sections 8442 and 8445, respectively, based on the service of the employee or Member to exceed the amount which would be payable to a widow or widower of such employee or Member under such section 8442 (determined without regard to any reduction to provide for an annuity under such section 8445); and






(B)
 shall not be effective, in the case of an employee or Member who is then married, unless it is made with the spouse’s written consent.





The Office shall by regulation provide that subparagraph (B) may be waived for either of the reasons set forth in section 8416(a)(2).




 Survivor elections; deposit; offsets
(a)
(1)
 An individual who makes an election under subsection (b) or (c) of section 8416 or section 8417(b) which is required to be made within 2 years after the date of a prescribed event shall deposit into the Fund an amount determined by the Office (as nearly as may be administratively feasible) to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such individual would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement (or, if later, and in the case of an election under such section 8416(b), since the date the previous reduction in the annuity of such individual was terminated under paragraph (1) or (2) of section 8419(b)), plus interest.




(2)
 Interest under paragraph (1) shall be computed at the rate of 6 percent a year.




(b)
 The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under subsection (a) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under subsection (a), except that the total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by this section shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under section 8415 or section 8452, including adjustments under section 8462. The reduction required by this subsection, which shall be effective at the same time as the election under section 8416(b) and (c) or section 8417(b), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage or the entitlement of the former spouse. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under section 8416(b) and (c) or section 8417(b).


(c)
 Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply if—
(1)
 the employee or Member makes an election under section 8416(b) or (c) after having made an election under section 8420; and




(2)
 the election under such section 8420 becomes void under subsection (b)(3) or (c)(2) of such section 8416.




(d)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which the survivor of an employee or Member may make a deposit under this section.


 Survivor reductions; computation
(a)
(1)
 Except as provided in paragraph (2), the annuity of an annuitant computed under section 8415, or under section 8452 (including subsection (a)(2) of such section, if applicable) or one-half of the annuity, if jointly designated for this purpose by the employee or Member and the spouse of the employee or Member under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, shall be reduced by 10 percent if a survivor annuity, or a combination of survivor annuities, under section 8442 or 8445 (or both) are to be provided for.




(2)
(A)
 If no survivor annuity under section 8442 is to be provided for, but one or more survivor annuities under section 8445 involving a total of less than the entirety of the amount referred to in subsection (b)(2) of such section are to be provided for, the annuity of the annuitant involved (as computed under section 8415, or under section 8452 (including subsection (a)(2) of such section, if applicable)) or one-half of the annuity, if jointly designated for this purpose by the employee or Member and the spouse of the employee or Member under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, shall be reduced by an appropriate percentage determined under subparagraph (B).




(B)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which an appropriate reduction under this paragraph, not to exceed a total of 10 percent, shall be made.






(b)
(1)
 Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for the current spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month—
(A)
 after the death of the spouse; or




(B)
 after the dissolution of the spouse’s marriage to the employee or Member, except that an appropriate reduction shall be made thereafter if the spouse is entitled, as a former spouse, to a survivor annuity under section 8445.






(2)
 Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for a former spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month after the former spouse remarries before reaching age 55 or dies. This reduction shall be replaced by appropriate reductions under subsection (a) if the retired employee or Member has one or more of the following:
(A)
 another former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445;




(B)
 a current spouse to whom the employee or Member was married at the time of retirement and with respect to whom a survivor annuity was not waived under section 8416(a) (or, if waived, with respect to whom an election under section 8416(d) has been made); or




(C)
 a current spouse whom the employee or Member married after retirement and with respect to whom an election has been made under subsection (b) or (c) of section 8416.






 Insurable interest reductions
(a)
(1)
 At the time of retiring under section 8412, 8413, or 8414, an employee or Member who is found to be in good health by the Office may elect to have such employee’s or Member’s annuity (as computed under section 8415) reduced under paragraph (2) in order to provide an annuity under section 8444 for an individual having an insurable interest in the employee or Member. Such individual shall be designated by the employee or Member in writing.




(2)
 The annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual named is younger than the retiring employee or Member, except that the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent.




(3)
 An annuity which is reduced under this subsection shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the individual named under this subsection, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced.




(b)
(1)
 In the case of a married employee or Member, an election under this section on behalf of the spouse may be made only if any right of such spouse to a survivor annuity based on the service of such employee or Member is waived in accordance with section 8416(a).




(2)
 Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of an employee or Member if such employee or Member has a former spouse who would become entitled to an annuity under section 8445 as a survivor of such employee or Member.




 Alternative forms of annuities
(a)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which any employee or Member who has a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition may, at the time of retiring under this subchapter, elect annuity benefits under this section instead of any other benefits under this subchapter, and any benefits under subchapter IV of this chapter, based on the service of the employee or Member.


(b)
 Subject to subsection (c), the Office shall by regulation provide for such alternative forms of annuities as the Office considers appropriate, except that among the alternatives offered shall be—
(1)
 an alternative which provides for—
(A)
 payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the employee or Member; and




(B)
 payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life; and






(2)
 in the case of an employee or Member who is married at the time of retirement, an alternative which provides for—
(A)
 payment of the lump-sum credit (excluding interest) to the employee or Member; and




(B)
 payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of a surviving spouse.






(c)
 Each alternative provided for under subsection (b) shall, to the extent practicable, be designed such that the present value of the benefits provided under such alternative (including any lump-sum credit) is actuarially equivalent to the sum of—
(1)
 the present value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided under this subchapter, as computed under section 8415; and




(2)
 the present value of the annuity supplement which would otherwise be provided (if any) under section 8421.




(d)
 An employee or Member who, at the time of retiring under this subchapter—
(1)
 is married, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section unless a waiver is made under section 8416(a); or




(2)
 has a former spouse, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section if the former spouse is entitled to benefits under section 8445 or 8467 (based on the service of the employee or Member) under the terms of a decree of divorce or annulment, or a court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any such decree, with respect to which the Office has been duly notified.




(e)
 An employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this subchapter and who makes an election under this section may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of retirement, make the election provided for under section 8416(d), subject to the deposit requirement thereunder.


 Annuity supplement
(a)
(1)
 Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (e) of section 8412, or under section 8414(c), also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.




(2)
 Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under section 8412(f), or under subsection (a) or (b) of section 8414, also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section if such individual is at least the applicable minimum retirement age under section 8412(h).




(3)
(A)
 An individual whose entitlement to an annuity under section 8412 or 8414 does not commence before age 62 is not entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.




(B)
 An individual entitled to an annuity supplement under this section ceases to be so entitled after the last day of the month preceding the first month for which such individual would, on proper application, be entitled to old-age insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, but not later than the last day of the month in which such individual attains age 62.






(b)
(1)
 The amount of the annuity supplement of an annuitant under this section for any month shall be equal to the product of—
(A)
 an amount determined under paragraph (2), multiplied by




(B)
 a fraction, as described in paragraph (3).






(2)
 The amount under this paragraph for an annuitant is an amount equal to the old-age insurance benefit which would be payable to such annuitant under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 203, 215(a)(7), and 215(d)(5) of such Act) upon attaining age 62 and filing application therefor, determined as if the annuitant had attained such age and filed application therefor, and were a fully insured individual (as defined in section 214(a) of such Act), on January 1 of the year in which such annuitant’s entitlement to any payment under this section commences, except that the reduction of such old-age insurance benefit under section 202(q) of such Act shall be the maximum applicable for an individual born in the same year as the annuitant. In computing the primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of this paragraph, the number of elapsed years (referred to in section 215(b)(2)(B)(iii) of such Act and used to compute the number of benefit computation years) shall not include years beginning with the year in which such annuitant’s entitlement to any payment under this section commences, and—
(A)
 only basic pay for service performed (if any) shall be taken into account in computing the total wages and self-employment income of the annuitant for a benefit computation year;




(B)
 for a benefit computation year which commences after the date of the separation with respect to which entitlement to the annuitant’s annuity under this subchapter is based and before the date as of which such annuitant is treated, under the preceding sentence, to have attained age 62, the total wages and self-employment income of such annuitant for such year shall be deemed to be zero; and




(C)
 for a benefit computation year after age 21 which precedes the separation referred to in subparagraph (B), and during which the individual did not perform a full year of service, the total wages and self-employment income of such annuitant for such year shall be deemed to have been an amount equal to the product of—
(i)
 the average total wages of all workers for that year, multiplied by




(ii)
 a fraction—
(I)
 the numerator of which is the total basic pay of the individual for service performed in the first year thereafter in which such individual performed a full year of service; and




(II)
 the denominator of which is the average total wages of all workers for the year referred to in subclause (I).










(3)
 The fraction under this paragraph for any annuitant is a fraction—
(A)
 the numerator of which is the annuitant’s total years of service (rounding a fraction to the nearest whole number, with ½ being rounded to the next higher number), not to exceed the number under subparagraph (B); and




(B)
 the denominator of which is 40.






(4)
 For the purpose of this subsection—
(A)
 the term “benefit computation year” has the meaning provided in section 215(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act;




(B)
 the term “average total wages of all workers”, for a year, means the average of the total wages, as defined and computed under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Social Security Act for such year; and




(C)
 the term “service” does not include military service.






(c)
 An amount under this section shall, for purposes of section 8467, be treated in the same way as an amount computed under section 8415.


 Reductions on account of earnings from work performed while entitled to an annuity supplement
(a)
 The amount of the annuity supplement to which an individual is entitled under section 8421 for any month (determined without regard to subsection (c) of such section) shall be reduced by the amount of any excess earnings of such individual which are required to be charged to such supplement for such month, as determined under subsection (b).


(b)
 The amount of an individual’s excess earnings shall be charged to months as follows:
(1)
(A)
 There shall be charged to each month of a year under subsection (a) an amount equal to the individual’s excess earnings (as determined under paragraph (2) with respect to such year), divided by the number of the individual’s supplement entitlement months for such year (as determined under paragraph (3)).




(B)
 Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the amount charged to a month under subsection (a) may not exceed the amount of the annuity supplement to which the individual is entitled under section 8421 for such month (determined without regard to subsection (c) of such section).






(2)
 The excess earnings based on which reductions under subsection (a) shall be made with respect to an individual in a year—
(A)
 shall be equal to 50 percent of so much of such individual’s earnings for the immediately preceding year as exceeds the applicable exempt amount for such preceding year; but




(B)
 may not exceed the total amount of the annuity supplement payments to which such individual was entitled for such preceding year under section 8421 (determined without regard to subsection (c) of such section, and without regard to this section).






(3)
(A)
 Subject to subparagraph (B), the number of an individual’s supplement entitlement months for a year shall be 12.




(B)
 The number determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced so as not to include any month after which such individual ceases to be entitled to an annuity supplement by reason of section 8421(a)(3)(B), relating to cessation of entitlement upon attaining age 62.






(4)
(A)
 For purposes of this section, and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the “earnings” and the “applicable exempt amount” of an individual shall be determined in a manner consistent with applicable provisions of section 203 of the Social Security Act.




(B)
 For purposes of this section—
(i)
 in determining the excess earnings of any individual, only earnings attributable to periods during which such individual was entitled to an annuity supplement under section 8421 shall be considered; and




(ii)
 any earnings attributable to a period before attaining the applicable retirement age under section 8412(h) shall not be considered in determining the excess earnings of an individual who retires under section 8412(d) or (e), or section 8414(c).








(5)
 Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) through (4), the reduction required by subsection (a) shall be effective with respect to the annuity supplement payable for each month in the 12-month period beginning on the first day of the seventh month after the end of the calendar year in which the excess earnings were earned.




(c)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which this section shall be applied in the case of a reemployed annuitant.


 Deductions from pay; contributions for other service; deposits
(a)
(1)
 The employing agency shall deduct and withhold from basic pay of each employee and Member a percentage of basic pay determined in accordance with paragraph (2).




(2)
 The percentage to be deducted and withheld from basic pay for any pay period shall be equal to—
(A)
 the applicable percentage under paragraph (3), minus




(B)
 the percentage then in effect under section 3101(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to rate of tax for old-age, survivors, and disability insurance).






(3)
(A)
 The applicable percentage under this paragraph for civilian service by employees or Members other than revised annuity employees or further revised annuity employees shall be as follows:

 Lump-sum benefits; designation of beneficiary; order of precedence
(a)
 Subject to subsection (b), an employee or Member who—

 is not reemployed in a position in which the individual is subject to this chapter at the time of filing the application; and




(4)
 will not become eligible to receive an annuity within 31 days after filing the application;





is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit. Except as provided in section 8420a, payment of the lump-sum credit to an employee or Member voids all annuity rights under this subchapter, and subchapters IV and V of this chapter, based on the service on which the lump-sum credit is based, until the employee or Member is reemployed in the service subject to this chapter.


(b)
(1)
(A)
 Payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) may be made only if the spouse, if any, and any former spouse of the employee or Member are notified of the employee or Member’s application.




(B)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which the lump-sum credit shall not be paid without the consent of a spouse or former spouse of the employee or Member where the Office has received such additional information or documentation as the Office may require that—
(i)
 a court order bars payment of the lump-sum credit in order to preserve the court’s ability to award an annuity under section 8445 or 8467; or




(ii)
 payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish the entitlement of the spouse or former spouse, under a court order on file with the Office, to a survivor annuity under section 8445 or to any portion of an annuity under section 8467.








(2)
(A)
 Notification of a spouse or former spouse under this subsection shall be made in accordance with such requirements as the Office shall by regulation prescribe.




(B)
 Under the regulations, the Office may provide that paragraph (1)(A) may be waived with respect to a spouse or former spouse if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office that the whereabouts of such spouse or former spouse cannot be determined.






(3)
 The Office shall prescribe regulations under which this subsection shall be applied in any case in which the Office receives two or more orders or decrees referred to in paragraph (1)(B)(i).




(c)
 Under regulations prescribed by the Office, an employee or Member, or a former employee or Member, may designate one or more beneficiaries under this section.


(d)
 Lump-sum benefits authorized by subsections (e) through (g) shall be paid to the individual or individuals surviving the employee or Member and alive at the date title to the payment arises in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other individual:
First, to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the employee or Member in a signed and witnessed writing received in the Office before the death of such employee or Member. For this purpose, a designation, change, or cancellation of beneficiary in a will or other document not so executed and filed has no force or effect.


Second, if there is no designated beneficiary, to the widow or widower of the employee or Member.


Third, if none of the above, to the child or children of the employee or Member and descendants of deceased children by representation.


Fourth, if none of the above, to the parents of the employee or Member or the survivor of them.


Fifth, if none of the above, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the employee or Member.


Sixth, if none of the above, to such other next of kin of the employee or Member as the Office determines to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the employee or Member at the date of death of the employee or Member.



For the purpose of this subsection, “child” includes a natural child and an adopted child, but does not include a stepchild.




(e)
 If an employee or Member, or former employee or Member, dies—
(1)
 without a survivor, or




(2)
 with a survivor or survivors and the right of all survivors under subchapter IV terminates before a claim for survivor annuity under such subchapter is filed,





the lump-sum credit shall be paid.


(f)
 If all annuity rights under this chapter (other than under subchapter III of this chapter) based on the service of a deceased employee or Member terminate before the total annuity paid equals the lump-sum credit, the difference shall be paid.


(g)
 If an annuitant dies, annuity accrued and unpaid shall be paid.


(h)
 Annuity accrued and unpaid on the termination, except by death, of the annuity of an annuitant or survivor shall be paid to that individual. Annuity accrued and unpaid on the death of a survivor shall be paid in the following order of precedence, and the payment bars recovery by any other person:
First, to the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the survivor.


Second, if there is no executor or administrator, payment may be made, after 30 days from the date of death of the survivor, to such next of kin of the survivor as the Office determines to be entitled under the laws of the domicile of the survivor at the date of death.

 An air traffic controller who is otherwise eligible for immediate retirement under section 8412(e) shall be separated from the service on the last day of the month in which that air traffic controller becomes 56 years of age or completes 20 years of service if then over that age. The Secretary, under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, may exempt a controller having exceptional skills and experience as a controller from the automatic separation provisions of this subsection until that controller becomes 61 years of age. The Secretary shall notify the controller in writing of the date of separation at least 60 days before that date. Action to separate the controller is not effective, without the consent of the controller, until the last day of the month in which the 60-day notice expires.

 So in original. Probably should be followed by a comma.
 as the case may be, becomes 57 years of age or completes 20 years of service if then over that age. If the head of the agency judges that the public interest so requires, that agency head may exempt such an employee from automatic separation under this subsection until that employee becomes 60 years of age. The employing office shall notify the employee in writing of the date of separation at least 60 days before that date. Action to separate the employee is not effective, without the consent of the employee, until the last day of the month in which the 60-day notice expires.




(2)
 In the case of employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the second sentence of paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting “65 years of age” for “60 years of age”. The authority to grant exemptions in accordance with the preceding sentence shall cease to be available after 
December 31, 2011
.




(c)
 A member of the Capitol Police who is otherwise eligible for immediate retirement under section 8412(d) shall be separated from the service on the last day of the month in which such member becomes 57 years of age or completes 20 years of service if then over that age. The Capitol Police Board, when in its judgment the public interest so requires, may exempt such a member from automatic separation under this subsection until that member becomes 60 years of age. The Board shall notify the member in writing of the date of separation at least 60 days before that date. Action to separate the member is not effective, without the consent of the member, until the last day of the month in which the 60-day notice expires.

The Marshal of the Supreme Court of the United States, when in his judgment the public interest so requires, may exempt such a member from automatic separation under this subsection until that member becomes 60 years of age. The Marshal shall notify the member in writing of the date of separation at least 60 days before the date. Action to separate the member is not effective, without the consent of the member, until the last day of the month in which the 60-day notice expires.


(e)
 The President, by Executive order, may exempt an employee (other than a member of the Capitol Police or Supreme Court Police) from automatic separation under this section if the President determines the public interest so requires.

 shall not be payable to a survivor who would not be entitled to benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of the Social Security Act based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant (determined, as of the date of the annuitant’s death, as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made appropriate application for benefits, but without regard to any restriction under either such subsection relating to remarriage); and




(C)
 shall not be payable to a survivor for any calendar month in which such survivor is entitled (or would, on proper application, be entitled) to benefits under section 202(g) of the Social Security Act (relating to mother’s and father’s insurance benefits), or under section 202(e) or (f) of such Act by reason of having become disabled, based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant.






(5)
 For the purpose of this subsection, the term “assumed CSRS annuity”, as used in the case of a survivor, means the amount of the annuity to which such survivor would be entitled under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title based on the service of the deceased annuitant, determined—
(A)
 as of the day after the date of the annuitant’s death;




(B)
 as if the survivor had made appropriate application therefor; and




(C)
 as if the service of the deceased annuitant were creditable under such subchapter.






(6)
 An amount payable under this subsection shall be adjusted under section 8462 and shall otherwise be treated under this chapter in the same way as an amount payable under subsection (a).




(g)
(1)
 If the widow or widower of an annuitant under section 8452 (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a “disability annuitant”) is determined under subsection (a) to be entitled to an annuity based on the service of such disability annuitant, the annuity of the widow or widower shall be equal to 50 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (2) (or one-half thereof if designated for this purpose under 
section 8419 of this title
), rather than of the amount referred to in subsection (a).




(2)
(A)
 Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount on which the annuity of the widow or widower of a disability annuitant is based shall be the amount of the annuity to which such disability annuitant was entitled, as computed under section 8452 (including appropriate reduction under subsection (a)(2) of such section and any adjustments under section 8462 allowed under section 8452), as of the day before the date of the disability annuitant’s death.




(B)
(i)
 In the case of a widow or widower entitled to an annuity based on the service of a disability annuitant who dies before age 62, the amount under clause (ii) shall apply instead of the amount which would otherwise apply under subparagraph (A).




(ii)
(I)
 Subject to subclause (II), the amount of the annuity to which the disability annuitant was entitled as of the day before the date of death shall be considered to be the amount which would be computed with respect to such disability annuitant under section 8452(b) if the disability annuitant had attained age 62 on the day before date of death.




(II)
 For purposes of any such computation under section 8452(b)(2) pursuant to this clause, creditable service shall (in addition to the service which would otherwise be used under subparagraph (B)(i) of such section) include the period of time between date of death and the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the annuitant, and average pay shall be adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii) of such section only through date of death.










(h)
 The following rules shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this section:
(1)
 The annuity payable under this section to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between—
(A)
 the amount of the annuity which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this section; and




(B)
 the amount of the annuity payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election made under section 8417(b) or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in section 8445(a).






(2)
 The amount payable under subsection (b)(1)(A) to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between—
(A)
 the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under such subsection; and




(B)
 the portion of such amount payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into.






(3)
 A lump-sum credit under subsection (c)(2) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as apply with respect to a lump-sum credit under section 8424(b).




 Rights of a child
(a)
(1)
 If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service which is creditable under section 8411, or an annuitant dies, each surviving child is, for any month, entitled to an annuity equal to—
(A)
 the amount by which the applicable amount under paragraph (2) for such month exceeds the applicable amount under paragraph (3) for such month, divided by




(B)
 the number of children entitled to a payment under this section for such month.






(2)
 The applicable amount under this paragraph for any month is the total amount to which the surviving child or children (as the case may be) of the annuitant, employee, or Member would be entitled for such month under subchapter III of chapter 83 (including any adjustment based on section 8340) based on the service of such annuitant, employee, or Member, if the service of such annuitant, employee, or Member were creditable under such subchapter.




(3)
 The applicable amount under this paragraph for any month is the total amount of child’s insurance benefits which are payable (or would, on proper application, be payable) under title II of the Social Security Act for such month based on the wages and self-employment income of such annuitant, employee, or Member.




(b)
 The annuity of a child under this subchapter—
(1)
 commences on the day after the annuitant, employee, or Member dies;




(2)
 commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes a student as described by section 8441(4), if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund; or




(3)
 commences or resumes on the first day of the month in which the child later becomes or again becomes incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability incurred before age 18 (or a later recurrence of such disability), if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund.





This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child—


(A)
 becomes 18 years of age unless then a student as described or incapable of self-support;




(B)
 becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless then such a student;




(C)
 becomes 22 years of age if then such a student and capable of self-support;




(D)
 ceases to be such a student after becoming 18 years of age unless then incapable of self-support; or




(E)
 dies or marries;





whichever occurs first. On the death of the surviving wife or husband, or former wife or husband, or termination of the annuity of a child, the annuity of any other child or children shall be recomputed and paid as though the wife or husband, former wife or husband, or child had not survived the annuitant, employee, or Member. If the annuity of a child under this subchapter terminates under subparagraph (E) because of marriage, then, if such marriage ends, such annuity shall resume on the first day of the month in which it ends, but only if any lump sum paid is returned to the Fund, and that individual is not otherwise ineligible for such annuity.


 Rights of a named individual with an insurable interest
The annuity of a survivor named under section 8420(a) is 55 percent of the reduced annuity of the retired employee or Member determined under paragraph (2) of such section 8420(a). The annuity of the survivor commences on the day after the retired employee or Member dies. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the survivor dies.
 Rights of a former spouse
(a)
 Subject to subsections (b) through (e), a former spouse of a deceased employee, Member, or annuitant (or of a former employee or Member who dies after having separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8413 but before having established a valid claim for annuity) is entitled to an annuity under this section, if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under section 8417(b), or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.


(b)
(1)
 The annuity payable to a former spouse under this section may not exceed the difference between—
(A)
 the amount applicable in the case of such former spouse, as determined under paragraph (2); and




(B)
 the amount of any annuity payable under this section to any other former spouse of the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election previously made under section 8417(b), or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in subsection (a).






(2)
 The applicable amount, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A) in the case of a former spouse, is the amount of the annuity which would be payable under the provisions of section 8442 (including subsection (f) of such section, but without regard to subsection (h) of such section) if such former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity under such provisions based on the service of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member.




(c)
 The commencement and termination of an annuity payable under this section shall be governed by the terms of the applicable order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, except that any such annuity—
(1)
 shall not commence before—
(A)
 the day after the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, dies; or




(B)
 the first day of the second month beginning after the date on which the Office receives written notice of the order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, together with such additional information or documentation as the Office may prescribe;





whichever is later; and




(2)
 except as provided in subsection (h), shall terminate no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age or dies.




(d)
 For purposes of this chapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in subsection (a) shall not be effective—
(1)
 if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, concerned; and




(2)
 to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this section.




(e)
 For purposes of this chapter, a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in subsection (a) shall not be effective, in the case of a former spouse, to the extent that it is inconsistent with any joint waiver previously executed with respect to such former spouse under section 8416(a).


(f)
(1)
 Any amount under section 8442(b)(1)(A) which would otherwise be payable to a widow or widower based on the service of another individual shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Office to a former spouse of such individual if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of a court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation.




(2)
 Paragraph (1) shall apply only to payments made by the Office after the date of receipt in the Office of written notice of such decree, order, or agreement, and such additional information and documentation as the Office may prescribe.




(g)
 Any payment under this section to a person bars recovery by any other person.


(h)
(1)
 Subsection (c)(2) (to the extent that it provides for termination of a survivor annuity because of a remarriage before age 55) shall not apply if the former spouse was married for at least 30 years to the individual on whose service the survivor annuity is based.




(2)
 A remarriage described in paragraph (1) shall not be taken into account for purposes of section 8419(b)(1)(B) or any other provision of this chapter which the Office may by regulation identify in order to carry out the purposes of this subsection.

(B)
 For purposes of this subsection, an employee shall be considered disabled only if the employee is found by the Office to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee’s position.






(2)
(A)
 Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee shall not be eligible for disability retirement under this section if the employee has declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the employee’s agency for which the employee is qualified if the position—
(i)
 is at the same grade (or pay level) as the employee’s most recent grade (or pay level) or higher;




(ii)
 is within the employee’s commuting area; and




(iii)
 is one in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.

 Computation of disability annuity
(a)
(1)
(A)
 Except as provided in paragraph (2), or subsection (b), (c), or (d), the annuity of an annuitant under this subchapter—
(i)
 for the period beginning on the date on which such annuity commences, or is restored (as described in section 8455(b)(2) or (3)), and ending at the end of the twelfth month beginning on or after such date, shall be equal to 60 percent of the annuitant’s average pay; and




(ii)
 after the end of the period referred to in clause (i), shall be equal to 40 percent of the annuitant’s average pay.






(B)
 An annuity computed under this paragraph—
(i)
 shall not, during any period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), be adjusted under section 8462; but




(ii)
 shall, after the end of any period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), be adjusted to reflect all adjustments made under section 8462(b) after the end of the period referred to in subparagraph (A)(i), whether the amount actually payable to the annuitant under this section in any month is determined under this subsection or otherwise.








(2)
(A)
 For any month in which an annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter as computed under paragraph (1) and to a disability insurance benefit under section 223 of the Social Security Act, the annuitant’s annuity for such month (as so computed) shall—
(i)
 if such month occurs during a period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), be reduced by 100 percent of the annuitant’s assumed disability insurance benefit for such month; or




(ii)
 if such month occurs other than during a period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i), be reduced by 60 percent of the annuitant’s assumed disability insurance benefit for such month;





except that an annuity may not be reduced below zero by reason of this paragraph.




(B)
(i)
 For purposes of this paragraph, the assumed disability insurance benefit of an annuitant for any month shall be equal to—
(I)
 the amount of the disability insurance benefit to which the annuitant is entitled under section 223 of the Social Security Act for the month in which the annuity under this subchapter commences, or is restored, or, if no entitlement to such disability insurance benefits exists for such month, the first month thereafter for which the annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter and disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act, adjusted by




(II)
 all adjustments made under section 8462(b) after the end of the period referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(i) (or, if later, after the end of the month preceding the first month for which the annuitant is entitled both to an annuity under this subchapter and disability insurance benefits under section 223 of the Social Security Act) and before the start of the month involved (without regard to whether the annuitant’s annuity was affected by any of those adjustments).






(ii)
 For purposes of applying section 224 of the Social Security Act to the assumed disability insurance benefit used to compute the reduction under this paragraph, the amount of the annuity under this subchapter which is considered shall be the amount of the annuity as determined before the application of this paragraph.








(3)
 Section 8462 shall apply with respect to amounts under this subsection only as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2).




(b)
(1)
 Except as provided in subsection (d), if an annuitant is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter as of the day before the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the annuitant’s birth (hereinafter in this section referred to as the annuitant’s “redetermination date”), such annuity shall be redetermined by the Office in accordance with paragraph (2). Effective as of the annuitant’s redetermination date, the annuity (as so redetermined) shall be in lieu of any annuity to which such annuitant would otherwise be entitled under this subchapter.




(2)
(A)
 An annuity redetermined under this subsection shall be equal to the amount of the annuity to which the annuitant would be entitled under section 8415, taking into account the provisions of subparagraph (B).




(B)
 In performing a computation under this paragraph—
(i)
 creditable service of an annuitant shall be increased by including any period (or periods) before the annuitant’s redetermination date during which the annuitant was entitled to an annuity under this subchapter; and




(ii)
 the average pay which would otherwise be used shall be adjusted to reflect all adjustments made under section 8462(b) with respect to any period (or periods) referred to in clause (i) (without regard to whether the annuitant’s annuity was affected by any of those adjustments).








(c)
 Except as provided in subsection (d), the annuity of an annuitant under this subchapter shall be computed under section 8415 if—
(1)
 such annuity commences, or is restored, beginning on or after the redetermination date of the annuitant; or




(2)
 as of the day on which such annuity commences, or is restored, the annuitant satisfies the age and service requirements for entitlement to an annuity under section 8412 (other than subsection (g) of such section).




(d)
(1)
 The annuity to which an annuitant is entitled under this section (after the reduction under subsection (a)(2), if applicable, has been made) shall not be less than the amount of an annuity computed under section 8415 (excluding subsection (h) of such section).




(2)
 In applying this subsection with respect to any annuitant, the amount of an annuity so computed under section 8415 shall be adjusted under section 8462 (including subsection (c) thereof)—
(A)
 to the same extent, and otherwise in the same manner, as if it were an annuity—
(i)
 subject to adjustment under such section; and




(ii)
 with a commencement date coinciding with the date the annuitant’s annuity commenced or was restored under this subchapter, as the case may be; and






(B)
 whether the amount actually payable to the annuitant under this section in any month is determined under this subsection or otherwise.






 Application
A claim may be allowed under this subchapter only if application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who, at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter, is mentally incompetent if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.
 Medical examination
 Recovery; restoration of earning capacity
(a)
(1)
 If an annuitant receiving a disability retirement annuity from the Fund recovers from the disability before becoming 60 years of age, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 1 year after the date on which the Office determines that the annuitant has recovered, whichever is earlier.




(2)
 If an annuitant receiving a disability annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.




(b)
(1)
 If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (a) is not reemployed in a position in which that individual is subject to this chapter, such individual is deemed, except for service credit, to have been involuntarily separated from the service for the purpose of subchapter II of this chapter as of the date of termination of the disability annuity, and after that termination is entitled to annuity under the applicable provisions of such subchapter.




(2)
 If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (a)(2)—
(A)
 is not reemployed in a position subject to this chapter; and




(B)
 has not recovered from the disability for which that individual was retired;





the annuity of such individual shall be restored at the applicable rate under section 8452 effective the first of the year following any calendar year in which such individual’s income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.




(3)
 If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of a medical finding that the individual has recovered from disability is not reemployed in a position in which such individual is subject to this chapter, the annuity of such individual shall be restored at the applicable rate under section 8452 effective from the date on which the Office determines that there has been a recurrence of the disability.




(4)
 Paragraphs (2) and (3) shall not apply in the case of an annuitant receiving an annuity from the Fund under subchapter II of this chapter.

 Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section is governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the Fund as of the effective date of an increase, except as follows:
(1)
 The first increase (if any) made under subsection (b) to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to an annuitant or survivor (other than a child under section 8443) whose annuity has not been increased under this subsection or subsection (b) shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) of—

 the effective date of the adjustment last made under this section in the annuity of the annuitant on whose service on the widow’s or widower’s annuity is based; or

 The $15,000 amount referred to in section 8442(b)(1)(A)(ii) shall be increased at the same time that, and by the same percent as the percentage by which, annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 are increased.


 Rate of benefits
Each annuity payable from the Fund is stated as an annual amount, one-twelfth of which, rounded to the next lower dollar, constitutes the monthly rate payable on the first business day of the first month beginning after the month for which it has accrued.

(1)
 Except as otherwise provided in this chapter—
(A)
 an annuity payable from the Fund commences on the first day of the month after—

(A)
 who retires under section 8412; and




(B)
 whose separation occurs upon the expiration of a term (or other period) for which the individual was appointed or elected.






(b)
 Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the annuity of an annuitant under subchapter II or V of this chapter terminates on the date death or other terminating event occurs.


 Relationship between annuity and workers’ compensation
(a)
(1)
 An individual is not entitled to receive—
(A)
 an annuity under subchapter II or V, and




(B)
 compensation for injury to, or disability of, such individual under subchapter I of chapter 81, other than compensation payable under section 8107,





covering the same period of time.




(2)
 An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under subchapter IV and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 on account of the death of the same person.




(3)
 Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this chapter or subchapter I of chapter 81.




(b)
 If an individual is entitled to an annuity under subchapter II, IV, or V, and the individual receives a lump-sum payment for compensation under section 8135 based on the disability or death of the same person, so much of the compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the Department of Labor, shall be refunded to that Department for credit to the Employees’ Compensation Fund. Before the individual may receive the annuity, the individual shall—
(1)
 refund to the Department of Labor the amount representing the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or




(2)
 authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.





Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the annuity shall be transmitted to the Department of Labor for reimbursement to the Employees’ Compensation Fund. When the Department of Labor finds that the financial circumstances of an individual entitled to an annuity under subchapter II, IV, or V warrant deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Department determines appropriate.


 Waiver, allotment, and assignment of benefits
(a)
 An individual entitled to an annuity payable from the Fund may decline to accept all or any part of the amount of the annuity by a waiver signed and filed with the Office.

 An individual entitled to an annuity payable from the Fund may make allotments or assignments of amounts from the annuity for such purposes as the Office considers appropriate.


 Application for benefits
(a)
 No payment of benefits based on the service of an employee or Member shall be made from the Fund unless an application for payment of the benefits is received by the Office before the one hundred and fifteenth anniversary of the birth of the employee or Member.


(b)
 Notwithstanding subsection (a), after the death of an employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, a benefit based on the service of such employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, shall not be paid under subchapter II or IV of this chapter unless an application therefor is received by the Office within 30 years after the death or other event which establishes the entitlement to the benefit.


(c)
 Payment due a minor, or an individual mentally incompetent or under other legal disability, may be made to the person who is constituted guardian or other fiduciary by the law of the State of residence of the claimant or is otherwise legally vested with the care of the claimant or his estate. If a guardian or other fiduciary of the individual under legal disability has not been appointed under the law of the State of residence of the claimant, payment may be made to any person who, in the judgment of the Office, is responsible for the care of the claimant, and the payment bars recovery by any other person.

(b)
 Subsection (a) shall apply only to payments made by the Office or the Executive Director under this chapter after the date on which the Office or the Executive Director (as the case may be) receives written notice of such decree, order, other legal process, or agreement, and such additional information and documentation as the Office or the Executive Director may require.


(c)
 For the purpose of this section—
(1)
 the term “judgment rendered for physically, sexually, or emotionally abusing a child” means any legal claim perfected through a final enforceable judgment, which claim is based in whole or in part upon the physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of a child, whether or not that abuse is accompanied by other actionable wrongdoing, such as sexual exploitation or gross negligence; and

Unless the annuitant’s appointment is on an intermittent basis or is to a position as a justice or judge (as defined by 
section 451 of title 28
) or as an employee subject to another retirement system for Government employees, or unless the annuitant is serving as President, deductions for the Fund shall be withheld from the annuitant’s pay under section 8422(a) and contributions under section 8423 shall be made.

(1)
(A)
 If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, the annuitant’s annuity on termination of reemployment shall be increased by an annuity computed under section 8415(a) through (i) as may apply based on the period of reemployment and the basic pay, before deduction, averaged during the reemployment.




(B)
(i)
 If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8419, the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A) is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities payable under section 8442 or 8445 (or both) is increased by 50 percent of the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A), unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under subparagraph (A), the annuitant notifies the Office in writing that the annuitant does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased.




(ii)
 If an annuitant who is subject to the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for not less than 1 year of full-time service (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of full-time

 employment), the survivor annuity payable is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated.








(2)
(A)
 If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for at least 5 years, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 5 years of full-time service, the annuitant may elect, instead of the benefit provided by paragraph (1), to have such annuitant’s rights redetermined under this chapter.




(B)
 If an annuitant who is subject to the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 5 years of full-time service (or the equivalent thereof in the case of part-time employment), any person entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8442 or 8445 based on the service of such annuitant shall be permitted to elect, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to have such person’s rights under subchapter IV redetermined. A redetermined survivor annuity elected under this subparagraph shall be in lieu of an increased annuity which would otherwise be payable in accordance with paragraph (1)(B)(ii).






(3)
 If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for a period of less than 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to less than 1 year of full-time service, the total amount withheld under section 8422(a) from the annuitant’s basic pay for the period or periods involved shall, upon written application to the Office, be payable to the annuitant (or the appropriate survivor or survivors, determined in the order set forth in section 8424(d)).




(c)
 This section does not apply to an individual appointed to serve as a Governor of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service.


(d)
 If an annuitant becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by 
section 451 of title 28
, the annuitant may, at any time prior to resignation or retirement from regular active service as such a justice or judge, apply for and be paid, in accordance with section 8424(a), the amount (if any) by which the lump-sum credit exceeds the total annuity paid, notwithstanding the time limitation contained in such section for filing an application for payment.
