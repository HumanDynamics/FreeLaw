 Locality-based comparability payments
(a)
 Pay disparities shall be identified and reduced as follows:
(1)
 Comparability payments shall be payable within each locality determined to have a pay disparity greater than 5 percent.




(2)
(A)
 The localities having pay disparities, and the size of those disparities, shall, for purposes of any comparability payment scheduled to take effect in any calendar year, be determined in accordance with the appropriate report, as prepared and submitted to the President under subsection (d)(1) for purposes of such calendar year.




(B)
 Any computation necessary to determine the size of the comparability payment to become payable for any locality in a year (as well as any determination as to the size of any pay disparity remaining after that comparability payment is made) shall likewise be made using data contained in the appropriate report (described in subparagraph (A)) so prepared and submitted for purposes of such calendar year.






(3)
 Subject to paragraph (4), the amount of the comparability payments payable under this subsection in a calendar year within any locality in which a comparability payment is payable shall be computed using such percentage as the President determines for such locality under subsection (d)(2), except that—
(A)
 the percentage for the first calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than ⅕ of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;




(B)
 the percentage for the second calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 
3
⁄
10
 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;




(C)
 the percentage for the third calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than ⅖ of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;




(D)
 the percentage for the fourth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than ½ of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;




(E)
 the percentage for the fifth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than ⅗ of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;




(F)
 the percentage for the sixth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 
7
⁄
10
 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;




(G)
 the percentage for the seventh calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than ⅘ of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;




(H)
 the percentage for the eighth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 
9
⁄

 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent; and

 the percentage for the ninth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section, and any year thereafter, may not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent.






(4)
 Nothing in this section shall be considered to preclude the President, in his discretion, from adjusting comparability payments to a level higher than the minimum level otherwise required in a calendar year, including to the level necessary to eliminate a locality’s pay disparity completely.




(b)
 After the ninth calendar year (referred to in subsection (a)(3)(I)), the level of comparability payments payable within such locality may be reduced for any subsequent calendar year, but only if, or to the extent that, the reduction would not immediately create another pay disparity in excess of 5 percent within the locality (taking into consideration any comparability payments remaining payable).


(c)
(1)
 The amount of the comparability payment payable within any particular locality during a calendar year—
(A)
 shall be stated as a single percentage, which shall be uniformly applicable to General Schedule positions within the locality; and




(B)
 shall, for any employee entitled to receive a comparability payment, be computed by applying that percentage to such employee’s scheduled rate of basic pay (or, if lower due to a limitation on the rate payable, the rate actually payable), subject to subsection (g).






(2)
 A comparability payment—
(A)
 shall be considered to be part of basic pay for purposes of retirement under chapter 83 or 84, as applicable, life insurance under chapter 87, and premium pay under subchapter V of chapter 55, and for such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe; and




(B)
 shall be paid in the same manner and at the same time as the basic pay payable to such employee pursuant to any provision of law outside of this section.






(3)
 Nothing in this subchapter shall be considered to permit or require that any portion of a comparability payment be taken into account for purposes of any adjustment under section 5303.




(4)
(A)
 Only employees receiving scheduled rates of basic pay (subject to any pay limitation which may apply) shall be eligible for comparability payments under this section.




(B)
 Comparability payments shall not be payable for service performed in any position which may not, under subsection (f)(1)(A), be included within a pay locality.






(d)

Effective Date

 Authority to fix an alternative level of comparability payments
(a)
 If, because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare, the President should consider the level of comparability payments which would otherwise be payable under section 5304 in any year to be inappropriate, the President shall—
(1)
 prepare and transmit to Congress, at least 1 month before those comparability payments (disregarding this section) would otherwise become payable, a report describing the alternative level of payments which the President instead intends to provide, including the reasons why such alternative level is considered necessary; and

 implement the alternative level of payments beginning on the same date as would otherwise apply, for the year involved, under section 5304.




(b)
 The requirements set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3), respectively, of section 5303(b) shall apply with respect to any decision to exercise any authority to fix an alternative level of comparability payments under this section.


 Special pay authority
(a)
(1)
 Whenever the Office of Personnel Management finds that the Government’s recruitment or retention efforts with respect to 1 or more occupations in 1 or more areas or locations are, or are likely to become, significantly handicapped due to any of the circumstances described in subsection (b), the Office may establish for the areas or locations involved, with respect to individuals in positions paid under any of the pay systems referred to in subsection (c), higher minimum rates of pay for 1 or more grades or levels, occupational groups, series, classes, or subdivisions thereof, and may make corresponding increases in all rates of the pay range for each such grade or level. However, a minimum rate so established may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay (excluding any locality-based comparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law) for the grade or level by more than 30 percent, and no rate may be established under this section in excess of the rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule. In the case of individuals not subject to the provisions of this title governing appointment in the competitive service, the President may designate another agency to authorize special rates under this section.




(2)
 The head of an agency may determine that a category of employees of the agency will not be covered by a special rate authorization established under this section. The head of an agency shall provide written notice to the Office of Personnel Management (or other agency designated by the President to authorize special rates under the last sentence of paragraph (1)) which identifies the specific category or categories of employees that will not be covered by special rates authorized under this section. If the head of an agency removes a category of employees from coverage under a special rate authorization after that authorization takes effect, the loss of coverage will take effect on the first day of the first pay period after the date of the notice.




(b)
 The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are—
(1)
 rates of pay offered by non-Federal employers being significantly higher than those payable by the Government within the area, location, occupational group, or other class of positions under the pay system involved;




(2)
 the remoteness of the area or location involved;




(3)
 the undesirability of the working conditions or the nature of the work involved (including exposure to toxic substances or other occupational hazards); or




(4)
 any other circumstances which the Office of Personnel Management (or such other agency as the President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate) considers appropriate.




(c)
 Authority under subsection (a) may be exercised with respect to positions paid under—
(1)
 a statutory pay system; or




(2)
 any other pay system established by or under Federal statute for civilian positions within the executive branch.




(d)
 Within the limitations applicable under the preceding provisions of this section, rates of pay established under this section may be revised from time to time by the Office of Personnel Management (or by such other agency as the President may designate under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1)). The actions and revisions have the force and effect of statute.


(e)
 An increase in a rate of pay established under this section is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of section 5335.


(f)
 When a schedule of special rates established under this section is adjusted under subsection (d), a covered employee’s special rate will be adjusted in accordance with conversion rules prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (or by such other agency as the President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate).


(g)
(1)
 The benefit of any comparability payments under section 5304 shall be available to individuals receiving rates of pay established under this section to such extent as the Office of Personnel Management (or such other agency as the President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate) considers appropriate, subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (h).




(2)
 Payments under this subsection may not be made if, or to the extent that, when added to basic pay otherwise payable, such payments would cause the total to exceed the rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule.




(h)
 An employee shall not for any purpose be considered to be entitled to a rate of pay established under this section with respect to any period for which such employee is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under any other provision of law. For purposes of this subsection, the term “basic pay” includes any applicable locality-based comparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law.


(i)
 If an employee who is receiving a rate of pay under this section becomes subject, by virtue of moving to a new official duty station, to a different pay schedule, such employee’s new rate of pay shall be initially established under conversion rules prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (or such other agency as the President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate) in conformance with the following:
(1)
 First, determine the rate of pay to which such employee would be entitled at the new official duty station based on such employee’s position, grade, and step (or relative position in the rate range) before the move.




(2)
 Then, if (in addition to the change in pay schedule) the move also involves any personnel action or other change requiring a rate adjustment under any other provision of law, rule, or regulation, apply the applicable rate adjustment provisions, treating the rate determined under paragraph (1) as if it were the rate last received by the employee before the rate adjustment.




(j)
 A rate determined under a schedule of special rates established under this section shall be considered to be part of basic pay for purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83, chapter 84, chapter 87, subchapter V of chapter 55, and section 5941, and for such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe.

If, in the case of an employee so promoted or transferred who is receiving basic pay at a rate in excess of the maximum rate of his grade, there is no rate in the higher grade which is at least two step-increases above his existing rate of basic pay, he is entitled to—
(1)
 the maximum rate of the higher grade; or




(2)
 his existing rate of basic pay, if that rate is the higher.

(1)
 at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade; or




(2)
 at a step of the appropriate grade that does not exceed the highest previous rate of pay received by him during that service in the legislative branch.




(d)
 The rate of pay established for a teaching position as defined by 
section 901 of title 20
 held by an individual who becomes subject to subsection (a) of this section is deemed increased by an amount determined under regulations which the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe for the determination of the yearly rate of pay of the position.

(e)
 An employee of a county committee established pursuant to section 8(b) of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act (
16 U.S.C. 590h(b)

(1)
 the lowest rate of the higher grade that exceeds the rate of basic pay of the employee with the county committee by not less than 2 step-increases of the grade from which the employee was promoted, if the Federal Civil Service position under this subchapter is at a higher grade than the last grade the employee had while an employee of the county committee;




(2)

(3)
 the lowest step of the Federal grade for which the rate of basic pay is equal to or greater than the highest previous rate of pay of the employee, if the Federal Civil Service position under this subchapter is at a lower grade than the last grade the employee had while an employee of the county committee.

(1)
 An employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard described in section 2105(c) who moves, without a break in service of more than 3 days, to a position in the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, that is subject to this subchapter, may have such employee’s initial rate of basic pay fixed at the minimum rate of the appropriate grade or at any step of such grade that does not exceed—
(A)
 if the highest previous rate of basic pay received by that employee during the employee’s service described in section 2105(c) is equal to a rate of the appropriate grade, such rate of the appropriate grade;




(B)
 if the employee’s highest previous rate of basic pay (as described in subparagraph (A)) is between two rates of the appropriate grade, the higher of those two rates; or




(C)
 if the employee’s highest previous rate of basic pay (as described in subparagraph (A)) exceeds the maximum rate of the appropriate grade, the maximum rate of the appropriate grade.






(2)

(g)
 In the case of an employee who—
(1)
 moves to a new official duty station, and




(2)
 by virtue of such move, becomes subject to a different pay schedule,





any rate adjustment under the preceding provisions of this section, with respect to such employee in connection with such move, shall be made—


(A)
 first, by determining the rate of pay to which such employee would be entitled at the new official duty station based on such employee’s position, grade, and step (or relative position in the rate range) before the move, and




(B)
 then, by applying the provisions of this section that would otherwise apply (if any), treating the rate determined under subparagraph (A) as if it were the rate last received by the employee before the rate adjustment.

 Periodic step-increases
(a)
 An employee paid on an annual basis, and occupying a permanent position within the scope of the General Schedule, who has not reached the maximum rate of pay for the grade in which his position is placed, shall be advanced in pay successively to the next higher rate within the grade at the beginning of the next pay period following the completion of—
(1)
 each 52 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 1, 2, and 3;




(2)
 each 104 calendar weeks of service in pay rates 4, 5, and 6; or




(3)

subject to the following conditions:


(A)
 the employee did not receive an equivalent increase in pay from any cause during that period; and




(B)
 the work of the employee is of an acceptable level of competence as determined by the head of the agency.

 When a determination is made under subsection (a) of this section that the work of an employee is not of an acceptable level of competence, the employee is entitled to prompt written notice of that determination and an opportunity for reconsideration of the determination within his agency under uniform procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management. If the determination is affirmed on reconsideration, the employee is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. If the reconsideration or appeal results in a reversal of the earlier determination, the new determination supersedes the earlier determination and is deemed to have been made as of the date of the earlier determination. The authority of the Office to prescribe procedures and the entitlement of the employee to appeal to the Board do not apply to a determination of acceptable level of competence made by the Librarian of Congress.

 This section does not apply to the pay of an individual appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.


(f)
 In computing periods of service under subsection (a) in the case of an employee who moves without a break in service of more than 3 days from a position under a nonappropriated fund instrumentality of the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard described in section 2105(c) to a position under the Department of Defense or the Coast Guard, respectively, that is subject to this subchapter, service under such instrumentality shall, under regulations prescribed by the Office, be deemed service in a position subject to this subchapter.


 Additional step-increases
(a)
 Within the limit of available appropriations and under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, the head of each agency may grant additional step-increases in recognition of high quality performance above that ordinarily found in the type of position concerned. However, an employee is eligible under this section for only one additional step-increase within any 52-week period.


(b)
 A step-increase under this section is in addition to those under 
section 5335 of this title
 and is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of 
section 5335(a) of this title
.
