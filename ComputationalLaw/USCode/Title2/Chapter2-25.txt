UNFUNDED MANDATES REFORM
 Purposes
 Definitions
 Exclusions
 Agency assistance
Each agency shall provide to the Director such information and assistance as the Director may reasonably request to assist the Director in carrying out this chapter.
 Cost of regulations
(a)
 Sense of Congress
It is the sense of the Congress that Federal agencies should review and evaluate planned regulations to ensure that the cost estimates provided by the Congressional Budget Office will be carefully considered as regulations are promulgated.




(b)
 Statement of cost
At the request of a committee chairman or ranking minority member, the Director shall, to the extent practicable, prepare a comparison between—
(1)
 an estimate by the relevant agency, prepared under 
section 1532 of this title
, of the costs of regulations implementing an Act containing a Federal mandate; and




(2)
 the cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office for such Act when it was enacted by the Congress.




(c)
 Cooperation of Office of Management and Budget
At the request of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall provide data and cost estimates for regulations implementing an Act containing a Federal mandate covered by part B of title IV of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 [
2 U.S.C. 658
 et seq.].




 Consideration for Federal funding
Nothing in this chapter shall preclude a State, local, or tribal government that already complies with all or part of the Federal intergovernmental mandates included in the bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report from consideration for Federal funding under 
 Impact on local governments
(a)
 Findings
The Senate finds that—
(1)
 the Congress should be concerned about shifting costs from Federal to State and local authorities and should be equally concerned about the growing tendency of States to shift costs to local governments;




(2)
 cost shifting from States to local governments has, in many instances, forced local governments to raise property taxes or curtail sometimes essential services; and




(3)
 increases in local property taxes and cuts in essential services threaten the ability of many citizens to attain and maintain the American dream of owning a home in a safe, secure community.




(b)
 Sense of Senate
It is the sense of the Senate that—
(1)
 the Federal Government should not shift certain costs to the State, and States should end the practice of shifting costs to local governments, which forces many local governments to increase property taxes;




(2)
 States should end the imposition, in the absence of full consideration by their legislatures, of State issued mandates on local governments without adequate State funding, in a manner that may displace other essential government priorities; and




(3)
 one primary objective of this chapter and other efforts to change the relationship among Federal, State, and local governments should be to reduce taxes and spending at all levels and to end the practice of shifting costs from one level of government to another with little or no benefit to taxpayers.




 Enforcement in House of Representatives

(b)
