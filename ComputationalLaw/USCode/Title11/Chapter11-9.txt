section 364(d) of this title
, then such claim shall be allowable as an administrative expense under 
section 503(b) of this title
.

 Notwithstanding 
section 362 of this title
 and subsection (a) of this section, a petition filed under this chapter does not operate as a stay of application of pledged special revenues in a manner consistent with
