(a)
 Subject to subsection (d), as soon as practicable after completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, and in the case of a debtor who is required by a judicial or administrative order, or by statute, to pay a domestic support obligation, after such debtor certifies that all amounts payable under such order or such statute that are due on or before the date of the certification (including amounts due before the petition was filed, but only to the extent provided for by the plan) have been paid, unless the court approves a written waiver of discharge executed by the debtor after the order for relief under this chapter, the court shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under 
section 502 of this title
, except any debt—
(1)
 provided for under section 1322(b)(5);

 for restitution, or damages, awarded in a civil action against the debtor as a result of willful or malicious injury by the debtor that caused personal injury to an individual or the death of an individual.




(b)
 Subject to subsection (d), at any time after the confirmation of the plan and after notice and a hearing, the court may grant a discharge to a debtor that has not completed payments under the plan only if—
(1)
 the debtor’s failure to complete such payments is due to circumstances for which the debtor should not justly be held accountable;




(2)
 the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property actually distributed under the plan on account of each allowed unsecured claim is not less than the amount that would have been paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor had been liquidated under chapter 7 of this title on such date; and




(3)
 modification of the plan under 
section 1329 of this title
 is not practicable.




(c)
 A discharge granted under subsection (b) of this section discharges the debtor from all unsecured debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under 
section 502 of this title
, except any debt—
(1)
 provided for under 
section 1322(b)(5) of this title
; or




(2)
 of a kind specified in 
section 523(a) of this title
.




(d)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a discharge granted under this section does not discharge the debtor from any debt based on an allowed claim filed under 
section 1305(a)(2) of this title
 if prior approval by the trustee of the debtor’s incurring such debt was practicable and was not obtained.


(e)
 On request of a party in interest before one year after a discharge under this section is granted, and after notice and a hearing, the court may revoke such discharge only if—
(1)
 such discharge was obtained by the debtor through fraud; and




(2)
 the requesting party did not know of such fraud until after such discharge was granted.




(f)
 Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the court shall not grant a discharge of all debts provided for in the plan or disallowed under section 502, if the debtor has received a discharge—
(1)
 in a case filed under chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title during the 4-year period preceding the date of the order for relief under this chapter, or




(2)
 in a case filed under chapter 13 of this title during the 2-year period preceding the date of such order.




(g)
(1)
 The court shall not grant a discharge under this section to a debtor unless after filing a petition the debtor has completed an instructional course concerning personal financial management described in section 111.




(2)
 Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a debtor who is a person described in section 109(h)(4) or who resides in a district for which the United States trustee (or the bankruptcy administrator, if any) determines that the approved instructional courses are not adequate to service the additional individuals who would otherwise be required to complete such instructional course by reason of the requirements of paragraph (1).




(3)
 The United States trustee (or the bankruptcy administrator, if any) who makes a determination described in paragraph (2) shall review such determination not later than 1 year after the date of such determination, and not less frequently than annually thereafter.




(h)
 The court may not grant a discharge under this chapter unless the court after notice and a hearing held not more than 10 days before the date of the entry of the order granting the discharge finds that there is no reasonable cause to believe that—
(1)
 section 522(q)(1) may be applicable to the debtor; and




(2)
 there is pending any proceeding in which the debtor may be found guilty of a felony of the kind described in section 522(q)(1)(A) or liable for a debt of the kind described in section 522(q)(1)(B).




 Modification of plan after confirmation
(a)
 At any time after confirmation of the plan but before the completion of payments under such plan, the plan may be modified, upon request of the debtor, the trustee, or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim, to—
(1)
 increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan;




(2)
 extend or reduce the time for such payments;




(3)
 alter the amount of the distribution to a creditor whose claim is provided for by the plan to the extent necessary to take account of any payment of such claim other than under the plan; or




(4)
 reduce amounts to be paid under the plan by the actual amount expended by the debtor to purchase health insurance for the debtor (and for any dependent of the debtor if such dependent does not otherwise have health insurance coverage) if the debtor documents the cost of such insurance and demonstrates that—
(A)
 such expenses are reasonable and necessary;




(B)
(i)
 if the debtor previously paid for health insurance, the amount is not materially larger than the cost the debtor previously paid or the cost necessary to maintain the lapsed policy; or




(ii)
 if the debtor did not have health insurance, the amount is not materially larger than the reasonable cost that would be incurred by a debtor who purchases health insurance, who has similar income, expenses, age, and health status, and who lives in the same geographical location with the same number of dependents who do not otherwise have health insurance coverage; and






(C)
 the amount is not otherwise allowed for purposes of determining disposable income under 
section 1325(b) of this title
;





and upon request of any party in interest, files proof that a health insurance policy was purchased.




(b)
(1)
 Sections 1322(a), 1322(b), and 1323(c) of this title and the requirements of 
section 1325(a) of this title
 apply to any modification under subsection (a) of this section.




(2)
 The plan as modified becomes the plan unless, after notice and a hearing, such modification is disapproved.




(c)
 A plan modified under this section may not provide for payments over a period that expires after the applicable commitment period under section 1325(b)(1)(B) after the time that the first payment under the original confirmed plan was due, unless the court, for cause, approves a longer period, but the court may not approve a period that expires after five years after such time.


 Revocation of an order of confirmation
(a)
 On request of a party in interest at any time within 180 days after the date of the entry of an order of confirmation under 
section 1325 of this title
, and after notice and a hearing, the court may revoke such order if such order was procured by fraud.


(b)
 If the court revokes an order of confirmation under subsection (a) of this section, the court shall dispose of the case under 
section 1307 of this title
, unless, within the time fixed by the court, the debtor proposes and the court confirms a modification of the plan under 
section 1329 of this title
.
