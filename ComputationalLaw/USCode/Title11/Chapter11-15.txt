 Definitions
 International obligations of the United States
To the extent that this chapter conflicts with an obligation of the United States arising out of any treaty or other form of agreement to which it is a party with one or more other countries, the requirements of the treaty or agreement prevail.
 Commencement of ancillary case
A case under this chapter is commenced by the filing of a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding under section 1515.
 Authorization to act in a foreign country
A trustee or another entity (including an examiner) may be authorized by the court to act in a foreign country on behalf of an estate created under section 541. An entity authorized to act under this section may act in any way permitted by the applicable foreign law.
 Public policy exception
Nothing in this chapter prevents the court from refusing to take an action governed by this chapter if the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the United States.
 Additional assistance
(a)
 Subject to the specific limitations stated elsewhere in this chapter the court, if recognition is granted, may provide additional assistance to a foreign representative under this title or under other laws of the United States.


(b)
 In determining whether to provide additional assistance under this title or under other laws of the United States, the court shall consider whether such additional assistance, consistent with the principles of comity, will reasonably assure—
(1)
 just treatment of all holders of claims against or interests in the debtor’s property;




(2)
 protection of claim holders in the United States against prejudice and inconvenience in the processing of claims in such foreign proceeding;




(3)
 prevention of preferential or fraudulent dispositions of property of the debtor;




(4)
 distribution of proceeds of the debtor’s property substantially in accordance with the order prescribed by this title; and




(5)
 if appropriate, the provision of an opportunity for a fresh start for the individual that such foreign proceeding concerns.




 Interpretation
In interpreting this chapter, the court shall consider its international origin, and the need to promote an application of this chapter that is consistent with the application of similar statutes adopted by foreign jurisdictions.
 Right of direct access
(a)
 A foreign representative may commence a case under section 1504 by filing directly with the court a petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding under section 1515.


(b)
 If the court grants recognition under section 1517, and subject to any limitations that the court may impose consistent with the policy of this chapter—
(1)
 the foreign representative has the capacity to sue and be sued in a court in the United States;




(2)
 the foreign representative may apply directly to a court in the United States for appropriate relief in that court; and




(3)
 a court in the United States shall grant comity or cooperation to the foreign representative.




(c)
 A request for comity or cooperation by a foreign representative in a court in the United States other than the court which granted recognition shall be accompanied by a certified copy of an order granting recognition under section 1517.


(d)
 If the court denies recognition under this chapter, the court may issue any appropriate order necessary to prevent the foreign representative from obtaining comity or cooperation from courts in the United States.


(e)
 Whether or not the court grants recognition, and subject to sections 306 and 1510, a foreign representative is subject to applicable nonbankruptcy law.


(f)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the failure of a foreign representative to commence a case or to obtain recognition under this chapter does not affect any right the foreign representative may have to sue in a court in the United States to collect or recover a claim which is the property of the debtor.


 Limited jurisdiction
The sole fact that a foreign representative files a petition under section 1515 does not subject the foreign representative to the jurisdiction of any court in the United States for any other purpose.
 Commencement of case under section 301, 302, or 303
(a)
 Upon recognition, a foreign representative may commence—
(1)
 an involuntary case under section 303; or




(2)
 a voluntary case under section 301 or 302, if the foreign proceeding is a foreign main proceeding.




(b)
 The petition commencing a case under subsection (a) must be accompanied by a certified copy of an order granting recognition. The court where the petition for recognition has been filed must be advised of the foreign representative’s intent to commence a case under subsection (a) prior to such commencement.


 Participation of a foreign representative in a case under this title
Upon recognition of a foreign proceeding, the foreign representative in the recognized proceeding is entitled to participate as a party in interest in a case regarding the debtor under this title.
 Access of foreign creditors to a case under this title
(a)
 Foreign creditors have the same rights regarding the commencement of, and participation in, a case under this title as domestic creditors.


(b)
(1)
 Subsection (a) does not change or codify present law as to the priority of claims under section 507 or 726, except that the claim of a foreign creditor under those sections shall not be given a lower priority than that of general unsecured claims without priority solely because the holder of such claim is a foreign creditor.




(2)
(A)
 Subsection (a) and paragraph (1) do not change or codify present law as to the allowability of foreign revenue claims or other foreign public law claims in a proceeding under this title.




(B)
 Allowance and priority as to a foreign tax claim or other foreign public law claim shall be governed by any applicable tax treaty of the United States, under the conditions and circumstances specified therein.






 Notification to foreign creditors concerning a case under this title
(a)
 Whenever in a case under this title notice is to be given to creditors generally or to any class or category of creditors, such notice shall also be given to the known creditors generally, or to creditors in the notified class or category, that do not have addresses in the United States. The court may order that appropriate steps be taken with a view to notifying any creditor whose address is not yet known.


(b)
 Such notification to creditors with foreign addresses described in subsection (a) shall be given individually, unless the court considers that, under the circumstances, some other form of notification would be more appropriate. No letter or other formality is required.


(c)
 When a notification of commencement of a case is to be given to foreign creditors, such notification shall—
(1)
 indicate the time period for filing proofs of claim and specify the place for filing such proofs of claim;




(2)
 indicate whether secured creditors need to file proofs of claim; and




(3)
 contain any other information required to be included in such notification to creditors under this title and the orders of the court.




(d)
 Any rule of procedure or order of the court as to notice or the filing of a proof of claim shall provide such additional time to creditors with foreign addresses as is reasonable under the circumstances.


 Application for recognition
(a)
 A foreign representative applies to the court for recognition of a foreign proceeding in which the foreign representative has been appointed by filing a petition for recognition.


(b)
 A petition for recognition shall be accompanied by—
(1)
 a certified copy of the decision commencing such foreign proceeding and appointing the foreign representative;




(2)
 a certificate from the foreign court affirming the existence of such foreign proceeding and of the appointment of the foreign representative; or




(3)
 in the absence of evidence referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2), any other evidence acceptable to the court of the existence of such foreign proceeding and of the appointment of the foreign representative.




(c)
 A petition for recognition shall also be accompanied by a statement identifying all foreign proceedings with respect to the debtor that are known to the foreign representative.


(d)
 The documents referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) shall be translated into English. The court may require a translation into English of additional documents.


 Presumptions concerning recognition
(a)
 If the decision or certificate referred to in section 1515(b) indicates that the foreign proceeding is a foreign proceeding and that the person or body is a foreign representative, the court is entitled to so presume.


(b)
 The court is entitled to presume that documents submitted in support of the petition for recognition are authentic, whether or not they have been legalized.


(c)
 In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the debtor’s registered office, or habitual residence in the case of an individual, is presumed to be the center of the debtor’s main interests.


 Order granting recognition
(a)
 Subject to section 1506, after notice and a hearing, an order recognizing a foreign proceeding shall be entered if—
(1)
 such foreign proceeding for which recognition is sought is a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain proceeding within the meaning of section 1502;




(2)
 the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body; and




(3)
 the petition meets the requirements of section 1515.




(b)
 Such foreign proceeding shall be recognized—
(1)
 as a foreign main proceeding if it is pending in the country where the debtor has the center of its main interests; or




(2)
 as a foreign nonmain proceeding if the debtor has an establishment within the meaning of section 1502 in the foreign country where the proceeding is pending.




(c)
 A petition for recognition of a foreign proceeding shall be decided upon at the earliest possible time. Entry of an order recognizing a foreign proceeding constitutes recognition under this chapter.


(d)
 The provisions of this subchapter do not prevent modification or termination of recognition if it is shown that the grounds for granting it were fully or partially lacking or have ceased to exist, but in considering such action the court shall give due weight to possible prejudice to parties that have relied upon the order granting recognition. A case under this chapter may be closed in the manner prescribed under section 350.


 Subsequent information
 Relief that may be granted upon filing petition for recognition
(a)

 staying execution against the debtor’s assets;




(2)
 entrusting the administration or realization of all or part of the debtor’s assets located in the United States to the foreign representative or another person authorized by the court, including an examiner, in order to protect and preserve the value of assets that, by their nature or because of other circumstances, are perishable, susceptible to devaluation or otherwise in jeopardy; and




(3)
