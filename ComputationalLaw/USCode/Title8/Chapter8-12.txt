“(a)
 
Findings
.—
Congress finds that—
“(1)
 the goal of the immigration protections for battered immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 [
Pub. L. 103–322, title IV
, see Tables for classification] was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive relationships;




“(2)
 providing battered immigrant women and children who were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against their abusers and the abusers of their children without fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit under the abuser’s control; and




“(3)
 there are several groups of battered immigrant women and children who do not have access to the immigration protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which means that their abusers are virtually immune from prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result of action by their abusers and the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter how compelling their case under existing law.




“(b)
 
Purposes
.—
The purposes of this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note above] are—
“(1)
 to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons who commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against immigrant women and children; and




“(2)
 to offer protection against domestic violence occurring in family and intimate relationships that are covered in State and tribal protection orders, domestic violence, and family law statutes.”




“(a)
 Findings and Purpose.—
“(1)
 
Findings
.—
Congress makes the following findings:
“(A)
 Immigrant women and children are often targeted to be victims of crimes committed against them in the United States, including rape, torture, kidnaping, trafficking, incest, domestic violence, sexual assault, female genital mutilation, forced prostitution, involuntary servitude, being held hostage or being criminally restrained.




“(B)
 All women and children who are victims of these crimes committed against them in the United States must be able to report these crimes to law enforcement and fully participate in the investigation of the crimes committed against them and the prosecution of the perpetrators of such crimes.






“(2)
 Purpose.—
“(A)
 The purpose of this section [amending this section and sections 1182, 1184, 1255, and 1367 of this title] is to create a new nonimmigrant visa classification that will strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of domestic violence, sexual assault, trafficking of aliens, and other crimes described in section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act [
8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(U)(iii)
] committed against aliens, while offering protection to victims of such offenses in keeping with the humanitarian interests of the United States. This visa will encourage law enforcement officials to better serve immigrant crime victims and to prosecute crimes committed against aliens.




“(B)
 Creating a new nonimmigrant visa classification will facilitate the reporting of crimes to law enforcement officials by trafficked, exploited, victimized, and abused aliens who are not in lawful immigration status. It also gives law enforcement officials a means to regularize the status of cooperating individuals during investigations or prosecutions. Providing temporary legal status to aliens who have been severely victimized by criminal activity also comports with the humanitarian interests of the United States.




“(C)
 Finally, this section gives the Attorney General discretion to convert the status of such nonimmigrants to that of permanent residents when doing so is justified on humanitarian grounds, for family unity, or is otherwise in the public interest.”






“(a)
 
In General
.—
Each agency of the Federal Government or a State or political subdivision that administers a program affected by the provisions of this title [see Effective Date of 1996 Amendment note above], shall, directly or through the States, provide general notification to the public and to program recipients of the changes regarding eligibility for any such program pursuant to this title.


“(b)
 
Failure To Give Notice
.—
Nothing in this section shall be construed to require or authorize continuation of eligibility if the notice under this section is not provided.”


“(a)
 
Purchase of American-Made Equipment and Products
.—
It is the sense of the Congress that, to the greatest extent practicable, all equipment and products purchased with funds made available under this division [see Tables for classification] should be American-made.


“(b)
 
Notice to Recipients of Grants
.—
In providing grants under this division, the Attorney General, to the greatest extent practicable, shall provide to each recipient of a grant a notice describing the statement made in subsection (a) by the Congress.”

Authorization of Appropriations
.—
There are authorized to be appropriated for the Immigration and Naturalization Service to increase the resources for the Border Patrol, the Inspections Program, and the Deportation Branch to apprehend illegal aliens who attempt clandestine entry into the United States or entry into the United States with fraudulent documents or who remain in the country after their nonimmigrant visas expire—

“(2)
 an increase in examinations and other service activities of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other appropriate Federal agencies in order to ensure prompt and efficient adjudication of petitions and applications provided for under the Immigration and Nationality Act [this chapter].

“(2)
 for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, for fiscal year 1987, $12,000,000, and for fiscal year 1988, $15,000,000.

Use of Funds for Improved Services

Of the funds appropriated to the Department of Justice for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Attorney General shall provide for improved immigration and naturalization services and for enhanced community outreach and in-service training of personnel of the Service.

Supplemental Authorization of Appropriations for Wage and Hour Enforcement

8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)(B)(iii)
)) directed against the United States or its allies; and

(A)
 Cash assistance provided under this subsection to an employable refugee is conditioned, except for good cause shown—

 on the refugee’s registration with an appropriate agency providing employment services described in subsection (c)(1)(A)(i) of this section, or, if there is no such agency available, with an appropriate State or local employment service;




(ii)
 on the refugee’s participation in any available and appropriate social service or targeted assistance program (funded under subsection (c) of this section) providing job or language training in the area in which the refugee resides; and

(5)
 The Director is authorized to allow for the provision of medical assistance under paragraph (1) to any refugee, during the one-year period after entry, who does not qualify for assistance under a State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [
42 U.S.C. 1396
 et seq.] on account of any resources or income requirement of such plan, but only if the Director determines that—

 this will (i) encourage economic self-sufficiency, or (ii) avoid a significant burden on State and local governments; and

The Secretary may permit alternative projects to cover specific groups of refugees who have been in the United States 36 months or longer if the Secretary determines that refugees in the group have been significantly and disproportionately dependent on welfare and need the services provided under the project in order to become self-sufficient and that their coverage under the projects would be cost-effective.




(B)
 Refugees covered under such alternative projects shall be precluded from receiving cash or medical assistance under any other paragraph of this subsection or under title XIX or part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [

(f)
 Assistance to States and counties for incarceration of certain Cuban nationals; priority for removal and return to Cuba

(4)
 The authority of the Attorney General to pay compensation under this subsection shall be effective for any fiscal year only to the extent and in such amounts as may be provided in advance in appropriation Acts.




(5)
 It shall be the policy of the United States Government that the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and all other appropriate Federal officials and all appropriate State and county officials referred to in paragraph (2), shall place top priority on seeking the expeditious removal from this country and the return to Cuba of Cuban nationals described in paragraph (1) by any reasonable and responsible means, and to this end the Attorney General may use the funds authorized to carry out this subsection to conduct such policy.




“(a)
 Except as otherwise provided in this section, the amendments made by this part [enacting sections 1521 to 1524 of this title, amending

 The Attorney General is authorized to grant to an alien described in subsection (c) of this section permission to engage in employment in the United States and to provide to that alien an ‘employment authorized’ endorsement or other appropriate work permit.


“(c)
 This section applies with respect to any alien in the United States (1) who has applied before

“(b)
(1)
 If the sums appropriated for any fiscal year to make payments to States under this Act are not sufficient to pay in full the sum of the amounts which State educational agencies are entitled to receive under titles II through IV for such year, the allocations to State educational agencies under each of such titles shall be ratably reduced by the same percentage to the extent necessary to bring the aggregate of such allocations within the limits of the amounts so appropriated.




“(2)
 In the event that funds become available for making payments under this Act for any period after allocations have been made under paragraph (1) of this subsection for such period, the amounts reduced under such paragraph shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.

 The jurisdictions to which this section applies are Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.


“(b)
(1)
 Each jurisdiction to which this section applies shall be entitled to grants for the purposes set forth in sections 201(a), 302, and 402 in amounts equal to amounts determined by the Secretary in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary, except that the aggregate of the amount to which such jurisdictions are so entitled for any period—

“(2)
 If the aggregate of the amounts determined by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) to be so needed for any period exceeds an amount equal to such 1 percent limitation, the entitlement of each such jurisdiction shall be reduced proportionately until such aggregate does not exceed such limitation.




 (a)
 The Secretary shall, in accordance with the provisions of this title, make grants to State educational agencies for fiscal year 1981, and for each subsequent fiscal year, for the purposes of assisting local educational agencies of that State in providing basic education for eligible participants enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools. Payments made under this title to any State shall be used in accordance with applications approved under section 202 for public educational services for eligible participants enrolled in the elementary and secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of the local educational agencies of that State.


“(b)
(1)
 As soon as possible after the date of the enactment of the Consolidated Refugee Education Assistance Act [
Aug. 13, 1981
], the Secretary shall establish a formula (reflecting the availability of the full amount authorized for this title under section 203(b)) by which to determine the amount of the grant which each State educational agency is entitled to receive under this title for any fiscal year. The formula established by the Secretary shall take into account the number of years that an eligible participant assisted under this title has resided within the United States and the relative costs, by grade level, of providing education for elementary and secondary school children. On the basis of the formula the Secretary shall allocate among the State educational agencies, for each fiscal year, the amounts available to carry out this title, subject to such reductions or adjustments as may be required under paragraph (2) or subsection (c). Funds shall be allocated among State educational agencies pursuant to the formula without regard to variations in educational costs among different geographical areas.




“(2)
 The amount of the grant to which a State educational agency is otherwise entitled for any fiscal year, as determined under paragraph (1), shall be reduced by the amounts made available for such fiscal year under any other Federal law for expenditure within the State for the same purposes as those for which funds are made available under this title, except that the reduction shall be made only to the extent that (A) such amounts are made available for such purposes specifically because of the refugee, parolee, or asylee status of the individuals to be served by such funds, and (B) such amounts are made available to provide assistance to individuals eligible for services under this title. The amount of the reduction required under this paragraph shall be determined by the Secretary in a manner consistent with subsection (c).

“(c)
 Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any period with respect to the number of eligible participants and the amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(2) shall be made, whenever actual satisfactory data are not available, on the basis of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of its entitlement to any payment (or the amount thereof) under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such determination been made on the basis of accurate data.


 (a)
 No State educational agency shall be entitled to any payment under this title for any period unless that agency submits an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing or accompanied by such information, as the Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application shall—
“(1)
 provide that the payments under this title will be used for the purposes set forth in section 201(a);




“(2)
 provide assurances that such payments will be distributed among local educational agencies within that State in accordance with the formula established by the Secretary under section 201, subject to any reductions in payments for those local educational agencies identified under paragraph (3) to which funds described by section 201(b)(2) are made available for the same purposes under other Federal laws;

“(4)
 provide assurances that the State educational agency will not finally disapprove in whole or in part any application for funds received under this title without first affording the local educational agency submitting the application for such funds reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing; and




“(5)
 provide for making such reports as the Secretary may reasonably require to carry out this title.

 the total number of eligible participants enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of local educational agencies within all the States (other than the jurisdictions to which section 103 is applicable) during the fiscal year for which the determination is made,





multiplied by—

“(B)
 the amount equal to the product of (i) the number of eligible participants enrolled during the period for which the determination is made in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of each local educational agency described under paragraph (2) within that State, or in any elementary or secondary nonpublic school within the district served by each such local educational agency, who have been eligible participants at least one year but not more than two years, multiplied by (ii) $500; and

“(2)
 The local educational agencies referred to in paragraph (1) are those local educational agencies in which the sum of the number of eligible participants who are enrolled in elementary or secondary public schools under the jurisdiction of such agencies, or in elementary or secondary nonpublic schools within the districts served by such agencies, during the fiscal year for which the payments are to be made under this title, and are receiving supplementary educational services during such period, is equal to—

“(4)
 For the purpose of this subsection, the term ‘State’ does not include Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

“(c)
 Determinations by the Secretary under this title for any period with respect to the number of eligible participants and the amount of the reduction under subsection (b)(3) shall be made, whenever actual satisfactory data are not available, on the basis of estimates. No such determination shall operate because of an underestimate or overestimate to deprive any State educational agency of its entitlement to any payment (or the amount thereof) under this title to which such agency would be entitled had such determination been made on the basis of accurate data.


“(d)
 Whenever the Secretary determines that any amount of a payment made to a State under this title for a fiscal year will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the payment was made, the Secretary shall make such amount available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this title, be regarded as part of such State’s payment (as determined under subsection (b)) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.

 testimony received in any hearing on the application, of which a verbatim record shall be kept.

Such a request may be made ex parte except that the judge shall inform the Department of Justice of any request for a subpoena by the alien for a witness or material if compliance with such a subpoena would reveal classified evidence or the source of that evidence. The Department of Justice shall be given a reasonable opportunity to oppose the issuance of such a subpoena.

(3)
 Nationwide service

(C)
 
section 3504 of title 18
 and 
section 1806(c) of title 50
 shall not apply if the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States because it would disclose classified information or otherwise threaten the integrity of a pending investigation.

(3)
 Treatment of classified information
(A)
 Use
The judge shall examine, ex parte and in camera, any evidence for which the Attorney General determines that public disclosure would pose a risk to the national security of the United States or to the security of any individual because it would disclose classified information and neither the alien nor the public shall be informed of such evidence or its sources other than through reference to the summary provided pursuant to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Department of Justice may, in its discretion and, in the case of classified information, after coordination with the originating agency, elect to introduce such evidence in open session.

 In general
If an unclassified summary is not approved by the removal court under subparagraph (C), the Government shall be afforded 15 days to correct the deficiencies identified by the court and submit a revised unclassified summary.

 Revised summary
If the revised unclassified summary is not approved by the court within 15 days of its submission pursuant to subparagraph (C), the removal hearing shall be terminated unless the judge makes the findings under clause (iii).

 Findings
The findings described in this clause are, with respect to an alien, that—
(I)
 the continued presence of the alien in the United States would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person, and




(II)
 the provision of the summary would likely cause serious and irreparable harm to the national security or death or serious bodily injury to any person.








(E)
 Continuation of hearing without summary

(i)
 if the alien involved is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, the procedures described in subparagraph (F) shall apply; and

 In general
The procedures described in this subparagraph are that the judge (under rules of the removal court) shall designate a special attorney to assist the alien—

(f)
 Arguments
Following the receipt of evidence, the Government and the alien shall be given fair opportunity to present argument as to whether the evidence is sufficient to justify the removal of the alien. The Government shall open the argument. The alien shall be permitted to reply. The Government shall then be permitted to reply in rebuttal. The judge may allow any part of the argument that refers to evidence received in camera and ex parte to be heard in camera and ex parte.




(g)
 Burden of proof
In the hearing, it is the Government’s burden to prove, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the alien is subject to removal because the alien is an alien terrorist.




(h)
 Rules of evidence
The Federal Rules of Evidence shall not apply in a removal hearing.




(i)
 Determination of deportation
If the judge, after considering the evidence on the record as a whole, finds that the Government has met its burden, the judge shall order the alien removed and detained pending removal from the United States. If the alien was released pending the removal hearing, the judge shall order the Attorney General to take the alien into custody.




(j)
 Written order
At the time of issuing a decision as to whether the alien shall be removed, the judge shall prepare a written order containing a statement of facts found and conclusions of law.
