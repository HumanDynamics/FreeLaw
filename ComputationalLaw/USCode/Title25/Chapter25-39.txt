 et seq.], the Secretary shall provide for the management of Indian agricultural lands to achieve the following objectives:

 To protect, conserve, utilize, and maintain the highest productive potential on Indian agricultural lands through the application of sound conservation practices and techniques. These practices and techniques shall be applied to planning, development, inventorying, classification, and management of agricultural resources.




(2)
 To increase production and expand the diversity and availability of agricultural products for subsistence, income, and employment of Indians and Alaska Natives, through the development of agricultural resources on Indian lands.

 To manage agricultural resources consistent with integrated resource management plans in order to protect and maintain other values such as wildlife, fisheries, cultural resources, recreation and to regulate water runoff and minimize soil erosion.




(4)
 To enable Indian farmers and ranchers to maximize the potential benefits available to them through their land by providing technical assistance, training, and education in conservation practices, management and economics of agribusiness, sources and use of credit and marketing of agricultural products, and other applicable subject areas.




(5)
 To develop Indian agricultural lands and associated value-added industries of Indians and Indian tribes to promote self-sustaining communities.

(B)
 If a tribe chooses not to contract the development or implementation of the plan, the Secretary shall develop or implement, as appropriate, the plan in close consultation with the affected tribe.

 Whether developed directly by the tribe or by the Secretary, the plan shall—
(i)
 determine available agriculture resources;

 identify specific tribal agricultural resource goals and objectives;

 be completed within three years of the initiation of activity to establish the plan.








(2)
 Indian agriculture resource management plans developed and approved under this section shall govern the management and administration of Indian agricultural resources and Indian agricultural lands by the Bureau and the Indian tribal government.




 Indian participation in land management activities
(a)
 Tribal recognition
The Secretary shall conduct all land management activities on Indian agricultural land in accordance with goals and objectives set forth in the approved agricultural resource management plan, in an integrated resource management plan, and in accordance with all tribal laws and ordinances, except in specific instances where such compliance would be contrary to the trust responsibility of the United States.

(2)
 provide notice of such laws to persons or entities undertaking activities on Indian agricultural lands; and

 upon the request of an Indian tribe, require appropriate Federal officials to appear in tribal forums.




(c)
 Waiver of regulations
In any case in which a regulation or administrative policy of the Department of the Interior conflicts with the objectives of the agricultural resource management plan provided for in 
section 3711 of this title
, or with a tribal law, the Secretary may waive the application of such regulation or administrative policy unless such waiver would constitute a violation of a Federal statute or judicial decision or would conflict with his general trust responsibility under Federal law.




(d)
 Sovereign immunity
This section does not constitute a waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States, nor does it authorize tribal justice systems to review actions of the Secretary.
