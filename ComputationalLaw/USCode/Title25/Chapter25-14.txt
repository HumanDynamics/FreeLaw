 Congressional statement of findings
(a)
 Findings respecting historical and special legal relationship, and resultant responsibilities
The Congress, after careful review of the Federal Government’s historical and special legal relationship with, and resulting responsibilities to, American Indian people, finds that—
(1)
 the prolonged Federal domination of Indian service programs has served to retard rather than enhance the progress of Indian people and their communities by depriving Indians of the full opportunity to develop leadership skills crucial to the realization of self-government, and has denied to the Indian people an effective voice in the planning and implementation of programs for the benefit of Indians which are responsive to the true needs of Indian communities; and




(2)
 the Indian people will never surrender their desire to control their relationships both among themselves and with non-Indian governments, organizations, and persons.




(b)
 Further findings
The Congress further finds that—
(1)
 true self-determination in any society of people is dependent upon an educational process which will insure the development of qualified people to fulfill meaningful leadership roles;




(2)
 the Federal responsibility for and assistance to education of Indian children has not effected the desired level of educational achievement or created the diverse opportunities and personal satisfaction which education can and should provide; and




(3)
 parental and community control of the educational process is of crucial importance to the Indian people.




 Congressional declaration of policy
(a)
 Recognition of obligation of United States
The Congress hereby recognizes the obligation of the United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the direction of educational as well as other Federal services to Indian communities so as to render such services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.




(b)
 Declaration of commitment
The Congress declares its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government’s unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.




(c)
 Declaration of national goal
The Congress declares that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.

 Considerations and guidelines for preparation of report by Mediator and final adjudication by District Court
(a)
 The rights and interests, as defined in the Healing case, of the Hopi Tribe in and to that portion of the reservation established by the Executive order of 
December 16, 1882
, which is known as land management district no. 6 (hereinafter referred to as the “Hopi Reservation”) shall not be reduced or limited in any manner.


(b)
 The boundary lines resulting from any partitioning of lands in the joint use area shall be established so as to include the higher density population areas of each tribe within the portion of the lands partitioned to such tribe to minimize and avoid undue social, economic, and cultural disruption insofar as practicable.


(c)
 In any division of the surface rights to the joint use area, reasonable provision shall be made for the use of and right of access to identified religious shrines for the members of each tribe on the reservation of the other tribe where such use and access are for religious purposes.


(d)
 In any partition of the surface rights to the joint use area, the lands shall, insofar as is practicable, be equal in acreage and quality: 
Provided
, That if such partition results in a lesser amount of acreage, or value, or both to one tribe such differential shall be fully and finally compensable to such tribe by the other tribe. The value of the land for the purposes of this subsection shall be based on not less than its value with improvements and its grazing capacity fully restored: 
Provided further
, That, in the determination of compensation for any such differential, the Federal Government shall pay any difference between the value of the particular land involved in its existing state and the value of such land in a fully restored state which results from damage to the land which the District Court finds attributable to a failure of the Federal Government to provide protection where such protection is or was required by law or by the demands of the trust relationship.


(e)
 Any lands partitioned to each tribe in the joint use area shall, where feasible and consistent with the other provisions of this section, be contiguous to the reservation of each such tribe.


(f)
 Any boundary line between lands partitioned to the two tribes in the joint use area shall, insofar as is practicable, follow terrain which will facilitate fencing or avoid the need for fencing.


(g)
 Any claim the Hopi Tribe may have against the Navajo Tribe for an accounting of all sums collected by the Navajo Tribe since 
September 17, 1957
, as trader license fees or commissions, lease rental, or proceeds, or other similar charges for doing business or for damages in the use of lands within the joint use area, shall be for a one-half share in such sums.


(h)
 Any claim the Hopi Tribe may have against the Navajo Tribe for the determination and recovery of the fair value of the grazing and agricultural use of the lands within the joint use area by the Navajo Tribe and its individual members, since 
September 28, 1962
, shall be for one-half of such value.


 Joint ownership and management of coal, oil, gas and other minerals within or underlying partitioned lands; division of proceeds
Partition of the surface of the lands of the joint use area shall not affect the joint ownership status of the coal, oil, gas, and all other minerals within or underlying such lands. All such coal, oil, gas, and other minerals within or underlying such lands shall be managed jointly by the two tribes, subject to supervision and approval by the Secretary as otherwise required by law, and the proceeds therefrom shall be divided between the tribes, share and share alike.

(1)
 Either as a part of or in a proceeding supplementary to the action authorized in subsection (a) of this section, either tribe, through the chairman of its tribal council for and on behalf of the tribe, including all villages, clans, and individual members thereof, may prosecute or defend an action for the types of relief, including interest, specified in 
section 640d–17 of this title
, including all subsections thereof, against the other tribe, through its tribal chairman in a like representative capacity, and against the United States as to the types of recovery specified in subsection (a)(3) of

Provided
, That the tribe’s eligibility for such payments shall cease once a decision by the Secretary of the Interior declining to acknowledge such tribe becomes final and no longer appealable.

 Declaration of policy, Congressional findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
The Congress declares and finds that:
(1)
 It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to support the resolution of disputes over historical claims through settlements mutually agreed to by Indian and non-Indian parties.




(2)
 There is pending before the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina a lawsuit disputing ownership of approximately 140,000 acres of land in the State of South Carolina and other rights of the Catawba Indian Tribe under Federal law.




(3)
 The Catawba Indian Tribe initiated a related lawsuit against the United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages.




(4)
 Some of the significant historical events which have led to the present situation include:
(A)
 In treaties with the Crown in 1760 and 1763, the Tribe ceded vast portions of its aboriginal territory in the present States of North and South Carolina in return for guarantees of being quietly settled on a 144,000-acre reservation.




(B)
 The Tribe’s district court suit contended that in 1840 the Tribe and the State entered into an agreement without Federal approval or participation whereby the Tribe ceded its treaty reservation to the State, thereby giving rise to the Tribe’s claim that it was dispossessed of its lands in violation of Federal law.




(C)
 In 1943, the United States entered into an agreement with the Tribe and the State to provide services to the Tribe and its members. The State purchased 3,434 acres of land and conveyed it to the Secretary in trust for the Tribe and the Tribe organized under the Indian Reorganization Act [
25 U.S.C. 461
 et seq.].




(D)
 In 1959, when Congress enacted the Catawba Tribe of South Carolina Division of Assets Act (
25 U.S.C. 931–938
), Federal agents assured the Tribe that if the Tribe would release the Government from its obligation under the 1943 agreement and agree to Federal legislation terminating the Federal trust relationship and liquidating the 1943 reservation, the status of the Tribe’s land claim would not be jeopardized by termination.




(E)
 In 1980, the Tribe initiated Federal court litigation to regain possession of its treaty lands and in 1986, the United States Supreme Court ruled in South Carolina against Catawba Indian Tribe that the 1959 Act resulted in the application of State statutes of limitations to the Tribe’s land claim. Two subsequent decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit have held that some portion of the Tribe’s claim is barred by State statutes of limitations and that some portion is not barred.






(5)
 The pendency of these lawsuits has led to substantial economic and social hardship for a large number of landowners, citizens and communities in the State of South Carolina, including the Catawba Indian Tribe. Congress recognizes that if these claims are not resolved, further litigation against tens of thousands of landowners would be likely; that any final resolution of pending disputes through a process of litigation would take many years and entail great expenses to all parties; continue economically and socially damaging controversies; prolong uncertainty as to the ownership of property; and seriously impair long-term economic planning and development for all parties.




(6)
 The 102d Congress has enacted legislation suspending until 
October 1, 1993
, the running of any unexpired statute of limitation applicable to the Tribe’s land claim in order to provide additional time to negotiate settlement of these claims.




(7)
 It is recognized that both Indian and non-Indian parties enter into this settlement to resolve the disputes raised in these lawsuits and to derive certain benefits. The parties’ Settlement Agreement constitutes a good faith effort to resolve these lawsuits and other claims and requires implementing legislation by the Congress of the United States, the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina, and the governing bodies of the South Carolina counties of York and Lancaster.




(8)
 To advance the goals of the Federal policy of Indian self-determination and restoration of terminated Indian Tribes, and in recognition of the United States obligation to the Tribe and the Federal policy of settling historical Indian claims through comprehensive settlement agreements, it is appropriate that the United States participate in the funding and implementation of the Settlement Agreement.




(b)
 Purpose
It is the purpose of this subchapter—
(1)
 to approve, ratify, and confirm the Settlement Agreement entered into by the non-Indian settlement parties and the Tribe, except as otherwise provided by this subchapter;




(2)
 to authorize and direct the Secretary to implement the terms of such Settlement Agreement;




(3)
 to authorize the actions and appropriations necessary to implement the provisions of the Settlement Agreement and this subchapter;




(4)
 to remove the cloud on titles in the State of South Carolina resulting from the Tribe’s land claim; and




(5)
 to restore the trust relationship between the Tribe and the United States.

 meet the requirements for United States citizenship, some of them cannot prove that they are United States citizens; that, although the Band resides in the State of Texas, it owns no land there; that, because the Band owns no land in Texas, members of the Band are considered ineligible for services which the United States provides to other Indians who are members of federally recognized tribes because of their status as Indians except when the members of the Band are on or near the reservation of the Kickapoo Tribe of Oklahoma; that members of the Band live under conditions that pose serious threats to their health; and that, because their culture is derived from three different cultures, they have unique needs including, especially, educational needs.




(b)
 Declarations
Congress therefore declares that the Band should be recognized by the United States; that the right of the members of the Band to pass and repass the borders of the United States should be clarified; that services which the United States provides to Indians because of their status as Indians should be provided to members of the Band in Maverick County, Texas; and, that land in the State of Texas should be taken in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Band.
