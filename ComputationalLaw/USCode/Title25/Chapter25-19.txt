Chapter 19
INDIAN LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENTS
 Congressional findings and declaration of policy
(a)
 Findings and declarations
Congress hereby finds and declares that:
(1)
 The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Maliseet Tribe are asserting claims for possession of lands within the State of Maine and for damages on the ground that the lands in question were originally transferred in violation of law, including, but without limitation, the Trade and Intercourse Act of 1790 (
1 Stat. 137
), or subsequent reenactments or versions thereof.




(2)
 The Indians, Indian nations, and tribes and bands of Indians, other than the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, that once may have held aboriginal title to lands within the State of Maine long ago abandoned their aboriginal holdings.




(3)
 The Penobscot Nation, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Penobscot Nation’s Governor and Council, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Penobscot Nation which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.




(4)
 The Passamaquoddy Tribe, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Passamaquoddy Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.




(5)
 The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, as represented as of the time of passage of this subchapter by the Houlton Band Council, is the sole successor in interest, as to lands within the United States, to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Maliseet Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.




(6)
 Substantial economic and social hardship to a large number of landowners, citizens, and communities in the State of Maine, and therefore to the economy of the State of Maine as a whole, will result if the aforementioned claims are not resolved promptly.




(7)
 This subchapter represents a good faith effort on the part of Congress to provide the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians with a fair and just settlement of their land claims. In the absence of congressional action, these land claims would be pursued through the courts, a process which in all likelihood would consume many years and thereby promote hostility and uncertainty in the State of Maine to the ultimate detriment of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, their members, and all other citizens of the State of Maine.




(8)
 The State of Maine, with the agreement of the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation, has enacted legislation defining the relationship between the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and their members, and the State of Maine.




(9)
 Since 1820, the State of Maine has provided special services to the Indians residing within its borders, including the members of the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, and the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians. During this same period, the United States provided few special services to the respective tribe, nation, or band, and repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for the said tribe, nation, and band. In view of this provision of special services by the State of Maine, requiring substantial expenditures by the State of Maine and made by the State of Maine without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Maine not be required further to contribute directly to this claims settlement.




(b)
 Purposes
It is the purpose of this subchapter—
(1)
 to remove the cloud on the titles to land in the State of Maine resulting from Indian claims;




(2)
 to clarify the status of other land and natural resources in the State of Maine;




(3)
 to ratify the Maine Implementing Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Passamaquoddy Tribe, and the Penobscot Nation, and




(4)
 to confirm that all other Indians, Indian nations and tribes and bands of Indians now or hereafter existing or recognized in the State of Maine are and shall be subject to all laws of the State of Maine, as provided herein.




“(a)
 
Findings and Policy
.—
Congress hereby finds and declares that:
“(1)
 The Aroostook Band of Micmacs, as represented as of the time of passage of this Act by the Aroostook Micmac Council, is the sole successor in interest, as to lands within the United States, to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Micmac Nation which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Maine.




“(2)
 The Band was not referred to in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 [
25 U.S.C. 1721
 et seq.] because historical documentation of the Micmac presence in Maine was not available at that time.




“(3)
 This documentation does establish the historical presence of Micmacs in Maine and the existence of aboriginal lands in Maine jointly used by the Micmacs and other tribes to which the Micmacs could have asserted aboriginal title but for the extinguishment of all such claims by the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980.




“(4)
 The Aroostook Band of Micmacs, in both its history and its presence in Maine, is similar to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians and would have received similar treatment under the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980 if the information available today had been available to Congress and the parties at that time.




“(5)
 It is now fair and just to afford the Aroostook Band of Micmacs the same settlement provided to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians for the settlement of that Band’s claims, to the extent they would have benefited from inclusion in the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act of 1980.




“(6)
 Since 1820, the State of Maine has provided special services to the Indians residing within its borders, including the members of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs. During this same period, the United States provided few special services to the Band and repeatedly denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for the Indian groups in Maine. In view of this provision of special services by the State of Maine, requiring substantial expenditures by the State of Maine and made by the State of Maine without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Maine not be required further to contribute directly to this settlement.




“(b)
 
Purpose
.—
It is the purpose of this Act to—
“(1)
 provide Federal recognition of the Band;




“(2)
 provide to the members of the Band the services which the United States provides to Indians because of their status as Indians; and




“(3)
 place $900,000 in a land acquisition fund and property tax fund for the future use of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs; and




“(4)
 ratify the Micmac Settlement Act, which defines the relationship between the State of Maine and the Aroostook Band of Micmacs.




“(a)
 
Land Acquisition Fund
.—
There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Land Acquisition Fund, into which $900,000 shall be deposited by the Secretary following the appropriation of sums authorized by section 10.

Band Tax Fund
.—
(1)
 There is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States a fund to be known as the Aroostook Band of Micmacs Tax Fund, into which shall be deposited $50,000 in accordance with the provisions of this Act.




“(2)
 Income accrued on the Land Acquisition Fund shall be transferred to the Band Tax Fund until a total of $50,000 has been transferred to the Band Tax Fund under this paragraph. No transfer shall be made under this subsection if such transfer would diminish the Land Acquisition Fund to a balance of less than $900,000.




“(3)
 Whenever funds are transferred to the Band Tax Fund under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall publish notice of such transfer in the Federal Register. Such notice shall specify when the total amount of $50,000 has been transferred to the Band Tax Fund.

 The Secretary shall manage the Band Tax Fund in accordance with 
section 1 of the Act of June 24, 1938

), and shall utilize the principal and interest of the Band Tax Fund only as provided in paragraph (5) and section 5(d) and for no other purpose.




“(5)

“(C)
 which have been certified by the Commissioner of Finance in the State of Maine as valid claims that meet the requirements of this paragraph.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if—
“(1)
 the Band is liable to the State of Maine or any county, district, municipality, city, town, village, plantation, or any other political subdivision thereof for any tax, payment in lieu of property tax, or fees, together with any interest and penalties thereon, and




“(2)
 there are insufficient funds in the Band Tax Fund to pay such tax, payment, or fee (together with any interest or penalties thereon) in full,





the deficiency shall be paid by the Band only from income-producing property owned by the Band which is not held in trust for the Band by the United States and the Band shall not be required to pay such tax, payment, or fee (or any interest or penalty thereon) from any other source.


“(d)
 
Procedure for Filing and Payment of Claims

“(F)

, by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Council, is the sole successor in interest to the aboriginal entity generally known as the Western Pequot Tribe which years ago claimed aboriginal title to certain lands in the State of Connecticut; and


(f)
 the State of Connecticut is contributing twenty acres of land owned by the State of Connecticut to fulfill this subchapter. The State of Connecticut will construct and repair three sections of paved or gravel roadways within the reservation of the Tribe. The State of Connecticut has provided special services to the members of the Western Pequot Tribe residing within its borders. The United States has provided few, if any, special services to the Western Pequot Tribe and has denied that it had jurisdiction over or responsibility for said Tribe. In view of the provision of land by the State of Connecticut, the provision of paved roadways by the State of Connecticut, and the provision of special services by the State of Connecticut without being required to do so by Federal law, it is the intent of Congress that the State of Connecticut not be required to otherwise contribute directly to this claims settlement.

(d)
 Civil and criminal jurisdiction over lands acquired by United States in trust for Seminole Tribe
(1)

 So in original. The comma probably should not appear.
 (
67 Stat. 588
; Public Law 280), shall continue in full force and effect on such lands unless the United States accepts a retrocession by the State of such civil or criminal jurisdiction in whole or in part under 
section 1323 of this title
. The laws of Florida relating to alcoholic beverages, gambling, sale of cigarettes, and their successor laws, shall have the same force and effect within said transferred lands as they have elsewhere within the State. The State, with respect to the transferred lands, shall also have jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indians under said laws to the same extent the State has jurisdiction over said offenses committed elsewhere within the State.




(2)
 Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as permitting the exercise of the above jurisdiction by the State regarding matters to which 
section 1162(b) of title 18
 and

 apply.




(3)
 The scope of tribal sovereignty over transferred lands, with the specific exceptions of law relating to cigarettes, gambling and alcohol described in this subsection, shall be as required by applicable law with regard to existing tribal lands held in reservation or Federal trust status. Such transfer shall not confer upon the tribe, or upon the lands within the reservation, any additional water rights. Tribal water rights shall be deemed to be defined in the compact.

 Judicial review
(a)
 Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any action to contest the constitutionality of this subchapter shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within 180 days after 
December 31, 1987
. Exclusive jurisdiction over any such action is hereby vested in the United States District Court for the southern district of Florida.


(b)
 Notwithstanding any present immunity from suit enjoyed by any of the parties, jurisdiction regarding any controversy arising under the Settlement Agreement or compact or private agreement between the tribe and any third party entered into under authority of the compact is hereby vested in the United States District Court for the southern district of Florida. Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive except that the court shall not have jurisdiction to award money damages against the State, the district or the tribe. Proceedings in the district court under this section shall be expedited consistent with sound judicial discretion.


 Revocation of settlement
 Congressional findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds and declares that:
(1)
 It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to support the resolution of disputes over historical claims through settlements mutually agreed to by Indian and non-Indian parties.




(2)
 Disputes over certain land claims of the Puyallup Tribe and other matters, including—
(A)
 ownership of the Commencement Bay tidelands and areas of former Puyallup Riverbed, lands within the Puyallup Tribe’s Treaty Reservation, or intended reservation boundaries,




(B)
 railroad and other rights-of-way,




(C)
 control of fisheries resource and habitat,




(D)
 jurisdiction over law enforcement, environment, navigation, and authority and control in the areas of land use,




(E)
 business regulation and zoning,





have resulted in difficult community relations and negative economic impacts affecting both the Tribe and non-Indian parties.




(3)
 Some of the significant historical events that led to the present circumstances include—
(A)
 the negotiation of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in December 1854, by the Puyallup Indians and others, by which the tribes ceded most of their territories but reserved certain lands and rights, including fishing rights;




(B)
 the Executive Order of 1857 creating the Puyallup Indian Reservation;




(C)
 the Executive Order of 1873, clarifying and extending the Puyallup Reservation in the Washington Territory;




(D)
 the 
March 11, 1891
, Report of the Puyallup Indian Commission on allotments and the 1896 report by a second Puyallup Indian Commission describing the problems with sales of allotted lands; and




(E)
 the 1909 District Court for Tacoma decision of the United States of America against J.M. Ashton and the 1910 Supreme Court decision of United States of America against J.M. Ashton.






(4)
 It is recognized that both Indian and non-Indian parties enter into this settlement to resolve certain problems and claims and to derive certain benefits.




(5)
 There is a recognition that any final resolution of pending disputes through a process of litigation would take many years and entail great expense to all parties; continue economically and socially damaging controversies; prolong uncertainty as to the access, ownership, and jurisdictional status of issues in question; and seriously impair long-term economic planning and development for all parties.




(6)
 To advance the goals of Federal policy of Indian self-determination and to carry out the trust responsibility of the United States, and to advance the Federal policy of international trade and economic development, and in recognition of the Federal policy of settling these conflicts through comprehensive settlement agreements, it is appropriate that the United States participate in the funding and implementation of the Settlement Agreement.




(b)
 Purpose
Therefore, it is the purpose of this subchapter—
(1)
 to approve, ratify, and confirm the agreement entered into by the non-Indian settlement parties and the Puyallup Tribe of Indians,




(2)
 to authorize and direct the Secretary to implement the terms of such agreement, and




(3)
 to authorize the actions and appropriations necessary to implement the provisions of the Settlement Agreement and this subchapter.

 The submerged lands as of 
August 27, 1988
, in the Puyallup River within the 1873 Survey Area below the mean high water line.

 Definitions
 Findings and purposes
(a)
 City of Salamanca and congressional villages
The Congress finds and declares that:
(1)
 Disputes concerning leases of tribal lands within the city of Salamanca and the congressional villages, New York, have strained relations between the Indian and non-Indian communities and have resulted in adverse economic impacts affecting both communities.




(2)
 Some of the significant historical events which have led to the present situation include—
(A)
 beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, several railroads obtained grants or leases of rights of way through the Allegany Reservation without Federal authorization or approval and on terms which did not adequately protect the interests of the Seneca Nation;




(B)
 after construction of these railroads, Allegany Reservation lands were leased to railroad employees, persons associated with the railroads, residents of the city and farmers without Federal authorization or approval and on terms which did not adequately protect the interests of the Seneca Nation;




(C)
 none of these leases had Federal authorization or approval and, after the courts ruled these leases invalid, Congress enacted the Act of 
February 19, 1875
 (
18 Stat. 330
), confirming existing leases of Allegany Reservation lands, authorizing further leasing by the Seneca Nation, and making the confirmed leases renewable for a twelve year period;




(D)
 the Act of 
September 30, 1890
 (
26 Stat. 558
), amended the 1875 Act by substituting a renewal term of “not exceeding ninety-nine years” for the original renewal term of twelve years; and




(E)
 in 1952 the Seneca Nation filed a claim with the Indian Claims Commission against the United States for use of improper lease fees, and in 1977 a settlement was reached regarding such claim, providing for the payment of $600,000 to the Seneca Nation covering the period beginning in 1870 to the end of 1946.






(3)
 An analysis of historic land values indicates that the payments made under the original lease agreement and under the settlement described in paragraph (2)(E) were well below the actual lease value of the property.




(4)
 The approaching expiration of the Salamanca and congressional village leases on 
February 19, 1991
, has created significant uncertainty and concern on the part of the city of Salamanca and Salamanca residents, and among the residents of the congressional villages, many of whose families have resided on leased lands for generations.




(5)
 The future economic success of the Seneca Nation, city, and congressional villages is tied to the securing of a future lease agreement.




(6)
 The Federal and State governments have agreed that there is a moral responsibility on the part of both governments to help secure a fair and equitable settlement for past inequities.




(b)
 Purpose
It is the purpose of this subchapter—
(1)
 to effectuate and support the Agreement between the city and the Seneca Nation, and facilitate the negotiation of new leases with lessees in the congressional villages;




(2)
 to assist in resolving the past inequities involving the 1890 leases and to secure fair and equitable compensation for the Seneca Nation based on the impact of these leases on the economy and culture of the Seneca Nation;




(3)
 to provide a productive environment between the Seneca Nation and lessees for negotiating the leases provided for under the Agreement;




(4)
 to provide stability and security to the city and the congressional villages, their residents, and businesses;




(5)
 to promote the economic growth of the city and the congressional villages;




(6)
 to promote economic self-sufficiency for the Seneca Nation and its members;




(7)
 to promote cooperative economic and community development efforts on the part of the Seneca Nation and the city; and




(8)
 to avoid the potential legal liability on the part of the United States that could be a direct consequence of not reaching a settlement.

(b)

 The relinquishment of claims against the United States shall be effective upon payment by the United States to the Seneca Nation of the funds provided in

 The offers, and any acceptances thereof, referred to in subsection (a) of this section, and the relinquishment of claims against the State, the city, the congressional villages, and all prior lessees for payment of annual rents referred to in subsection (b) of this section shall not be binding on the Seneca Nation until after the later of the dates on which (1) Congress, or (2) the legislature of the State appropriates the amount of funds set forth in 
section 1774d of this title
 or the Seneca Nation and the State agree upon a schedule and mechanism for payments for funds pursuant to 
section 1774d(c) of this title
. Such agreement shall render the offers, acceptances and the relinquishment effective so long as the payments are made as agreed upon by the Seneca Nation and the State.

 Findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1)
 Under the treaty between the United States of America and the Crow Tribe of Indians concluded 
May 7, 1868
 (commonly known as the “Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868”; 
15 Stat. 649
), the eastern boundary of the Crow Indian Reservation was established as the 107th meridian for approximately 90 miles from the Yellowstone River to the boundary between Montana and Wyoming.




(2)
 Under Executive orders issued in 1884 and 1900, the western boundary of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation was established as the 107th meridian. The 107th meridian was intended to be the common boundary between the Crow Reservation and Northern Cheyenne Reservation for approximately 25 miles.




(3)
 From 1889 through 1891, a survey was conducted of the eastern boundary of the Crow Reservation. The 1891 survey line strayed to the west, and resulted in the exclusion from the Crow Indian Reservation of a strip of land of approximately 36,164 acres. Approximately 12,964 acres of such strip of land were included in the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Deposits of low sulphur coal underlie the land excluded from the Crow Indian Reservation, including the land included in the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.




(4)
(A)
 The erroneous nature of the survey was not discovered for several decades. Meanwhile, the areas along the 107th meridian to the north and south of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation were opened to settlement in the late nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century. Patents were issued to non-Indian persons and to the State of Montana for most of the surface land and a significant portion of the minerals in these areas between the 107th meridian and the 1891 survey line.




(B)
 The 12,964 acres included in the Northern Cheyenne Reservation have been treated as part of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation and occupied by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the Northern Cheyenne allottees, and their successors in interest.






(5)
 Legislation to resolve the 107th meridian boundary dispute was introduced in Congress in the 1960’s and 1970’s, and again in 1992, but no such legislation was enacted into law.




(b)
 Purpose
The purpose of this subchapter is to settle the 107th meridian boundary dispute created by the erroneous survey of the eastern boundary of the Crow Indian Reservation made by the Federal Government described in subsection (a)(3) of this section.

 Findings and purposes
(a)
 Findings
Congress makes the following findings:
(1)
 For many years the Pueblo of Santo Domingo has been asserting claims to lands within its aboriginal use area in north central New Mexico. These claims have been the subject of many lawsuits, and a number of these claims remain unresolved.




(2)
 In December 1927, the Pueblo Lands Board, acting pursuant to the Pueblo Lands Act of 1924 (
43 Stat. 636
) confirmed a survey of the boundaries of the Pueblo of Santo Domingo Grant. However, at the same time the Board purported to extinguish Indian title to approximately 27,000 acres of lands within those grant boundaries which lay within 3 other overlapping Spanish land grants. The United States Court of Appeals in United States v. Thompson (941 F.2d 1074 (10th Cir. 1991), cert. denied 503 U.S. 984 (1992)), held that the Board “ignored an express congressional directive” in section 14 of the Pueblo Lands Act, which “contemplated that the Pueblo would retain title to and possession of all overlap land”.




(3)
 The Pueblo of Santo Domingo has asserted a claim to another 25,000 acres of land based on the Pueblo’s purchase in 1748 of the Diego Gallegos Grant. The Pueblo possesses the original deed reflecting the purchase under Spanish law but, after the United States assumed sovereignty over New Mexico, no action was taken to confirm the Pueblo’s title to these lands. Later, many of these lands were treated as public domain, and are held today by Federal agencies, the State Land Commission, other Indian tribes, and private parties. The Pueblo’s lawsuit asserting this claim, Pueblo of Santo Domingo v. Rael (Civil No. 83–1888 (D.N.M.)), is still pending.




(4)
 The Pueblo of Santo Domingo’s claims against the United States in docket No. 355 under the Act of 
August 13, 1946
 (
60 Stat. 1049
; commonly referred to as the Indian Claims Commission Act) have been pending since 1951. These claims include allegations of the Federal misappropriation and mismanagement of the Pueblo’s aboriginal and Spanish grant lands.




(5)
 Litigation to resolve the land and trespass claims of the Pueblo of Santo Domingo would take many years, and the outcome of such litigation is unclear. The pendency of these claims has clouded private land titles and has created difficulties in the management of public lands within the claim area.




(6)
 The United States and the Pueblo of Santo Domingo have negotiated a settlement to resolve all existing land claims, including the claims described in paragraphs (2) through (4).




(b)
 Purpose
It is the purpose of this subchapter—
(1)
 to remove the cloud on titles to land in the State of New Mexico resulting from the claims of the Pueblo of Santo Domingo, and to settle all of the Pueblo’s claims against the United States and third parties, and the land, boundary, and trespass claims of the Pueblo in a fair, equitable, and final manner;




(2)
 to provide for the restoration of certain lands to the Pueblo of Santo Domingo and to confirm the Pueblo’s boundaries;




(3)
 to clarify governmental jurisdiction over the lands within the Pueblo’s land claim area; and




(4)
 to ratify a Settlement Agreement between the United States and the Pueblo which includes—
(A)
 the Pueblo’s agreement to relinquish and compromise its land and trespass claims;




(B)
 the provision of $8,000,000 to compensate the Pueblo for the claims it has pursued pursuant to the Act of 
August 13, 1946
 (
60 Stat. 1049
; commonly referred to as the Indian Claims Commission Act);




(C)
 the transfer of approximately 4,577 acres of public land to the Pueblo;




(D)
 the sale of approximately 7,355 acres of national forest lands to the Pueblo; and




(E)
 the authorization of the appropriation of $15,000,000 over 3 consecutive years which would be deposited in a Santo Domingo Lands Claims Settlement Fund for expenditure by the Pueblo for land acquisition and other enumerated tribal purposes.






(c)
 Rule of construction
Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to effectuate an extinguishment of, or to otherwise impair, the Pueblo’s title to or interest in lands or water rights as described in 
section 1777c(a)(2) of this title
.

 Congressional findings and purpose
(a)
 Findings
The Congress finds the following:
(1)
 In 1876, the Torres-Martinez Indian Reservation was created, reserving a single, 640-acre section of land in the Coachella Valley, California, north of the Salton Sink. The Reservation was expanded in 1891 by Executive order, pursuant to the Mission Indian Relief Act of 1891, adding about 12,000 acres to the original 640-acre reservation.




(2)
 Between 1905 and 1907, flood waters of the Colorado River filled the Salton Sink, creating the Salton Sea, inundating approximately 2,000 acres of the 1891 reservation lands.




(3)
 In 1909, an additional 12,000 acres of land, 9,000 of which were then submerged under the Salton Sea, were added to the reservation under a Secretarial Order issued pursuant to a 1907 amendment of the Mission Indian Relief Act. Due to receding water levels in the Salton Sea through the process of evaporation, at the time of the 1909 enlargement of the reservation, there were some expectations that the Salton Sea would recede within a period of 25 years.




(4)
 Through the present day, the majority of the lands added to the reservation in 1909 remain inundated due in part to the flowage of natural runoff and drainage water from the irrigation systems of the Imperial, Coachella, and Mexicali Valleys into the Salton Sea.




(5)
 In addition to those lands that are inundated, there are also tribal and individual Indian lands located on the perimeter of the Salton Sea that are not currently irrigable due to lack of proper drainage.




(6)
 In 1982, the United States brought an action in trespass entitled “United States of America, in its own right and on behalf of Torres-Martinez Band of Mission Indians and the Allottees therein v. the Imperial Irrigation District and Coachella Valley Water District”, Case No. 82–1790 K (M) (hereafter in this section referred to as the “U.S. Suit”) on behalf of the Torres-Martinez Indian Tribe and affected Indian allottees against the two water districts seeking damages related to the inundation of tribal- and allottee-owned lands and injunctive relief to prevent future discharge of water on such lands.




(7)
 On 
August 20, 1992
, the Federal District Court for the Southern District of California entered a judgment in the U.S. Suit requiring the Coachella Valley Water District to pay $212,908.41 in past and future damages and the Imperial Irrigation District to pay $2,795,694.33 in past and future damages in lieu of the United States request for a permanent injunction against continued flooding of the submerged lands.




(8)
 The United States, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the Imperial Irrigation District have filed notices of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit from the district court’s judgment in the U.S. Suit (Nos. 93–55389, 93–55398, and 93–55402), and the Tribe has filed a notice of appeal from the district court’s denial of its motion to intervene as a matter of right (No. 92–55129).




(9)
 The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stayed further action on the appeals pending the outcome of settlement negotiations.




(10)
 In 1991, the Tribe brought its own lawsuit, Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians, et al., v. Imperial Irrigation District, et al., Case No. 91–1670 J (LSP) (hereafter in this section referred to as the “Indian Suit”) in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, against the two water districts, and amended the complaint to include as a plaintiff, Mary Resvaloso, in her own right, and as class representative of all other affected Indian allotment owners.




(11)
 The Indian Suit has been stayed by the district court to facilitate settlement negotiations.




(b)
 Purpose
The purpose of this subchapter is to facilitate and implement the settlement agreement negotiated and executed by the parties to the U.S. Suit and Indian Suit for the purpose of resolving their conflicting claims to their mutual satisfaction and in the public interest.
