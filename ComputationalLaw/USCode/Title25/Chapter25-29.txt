(D)
(i)
 The governing body of an Indian tribe, in its sole discretion and without the approval of the Chairman, may adopt an ordinance or resolution revoking any prior ordinance or resolution that authorized class III gaming on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe. Such revocation shall render class III gaming illegal on the Indian lands of such Indian tribe.

Upon receiving such a request, the State shall negotiate with the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into such a compact.




(B)
 Any State and any Indian tribe may enter into a Tribal-State compact governing gaming activities on the Indian lands of the Indian tribe, but such compact shall take effect only when notice of approval by the Secretary of such compact has been published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.

section 1175 of title 15

(A)
 The United States district courts shall have jurisdiction over—

(II)
 the State did not respond to the request of the Indian tribe to negotiate such a compact or did not respond to such request in good faith,





the burden of proof shall be upon the State to prove that the State has negotiated with the Indian tribe in good faith to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities.




(iii)
 If, in any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), the court finds that the State has failed to negotiate in good faith with the Indian tribe to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities, the court shall order the State and the Indian Tribe

 So in original. Probably should not be capitalized.
 to conclude such a compact within a 60-day period. In determining in such an action whether a State has negotiated in good faith, the court—
(I)
 may take into account the public interest, public safety, criminality, financial integrity, and adverse economic impacts on existing gaming activities, and




(II)
 shall consider any demand by the State for direct taxation of the Indian tribe or of any Indian lands as evidence that the State has not negotiated in good faith.






(iv)
 If a State and an Indian tribe fail to conclude a Tribal-State compact governing the conduct of gaming activities on the Indian lands subject to the jurisdiction of such Indian tribe within the 60-day period provided in the order of a court issued under clause (iii), the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to a mediator appointed by the court a proposed compact that represents their last best offer for a compact.

(v)
 The mediator appointed by the court under clause (iv) shall submit to the State and the Indian tribe the compact selected by the mediator under clause (iv).




(vi)

(I)
 which are consistent with the proposed compact selected by the mediator under clause (iv), the provisions of this chapter, and the relevant provisions of the laws of the State, and




(II)
 under which class III gaming may be conducted on the Indian lands over which the Indian tribe has jurisdiction.

 any other provision of Federal law that does not relate to jurisdiction over gaming on Indian lands, or

 the trust obligations of the United States to Indians.
