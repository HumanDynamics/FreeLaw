 Definitions
 Integration of services authorized
The Secretary of the Interior, in cooperation with the appropriate Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health and Human Services, or Secretary of Education, shall, upon the receipt of a plan acceptable to the Secretary of the Interior submitted by an Indian tribal government, authorize the tribal government to coordinate, in accordance with such plan, its federally funded employment, training, and related services programs in a manner that integrates the program services involved into a single, coordinated, comprehensive program and reduces administrative costs by consolidating administrative functions.

 Plan review
Upon receipt of the plan from a tribal government, the Secretary of the Interior shall consult with the Secretary of each Federal agency providing funds to be used to implement the plan, and with the tribal government submitting the plan. The parties so consulting shall identify any waivers of statutory requirements or of Federal agency regulations, policies, or procedures necessary to enable the tribal government to implement its plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the affected agency shall have the authority to waive any statutory requirement, regulation, policy, or procedure promulgated by that agency that has been so identified by such tribal government or agency, unless the Secretary of the affected agency determines that such a waiver is inconsistent with the purposes of this chapter or those provisions of the statute from which the program involved derives its authority which are specifically applicable to Indian programs.
 Plan approval
Within 90 days after the receipt of a tribal government’s plan by the Secretary, the Secretary shall inform the tribal government, in writing, of the Secretary’s approval or disapproval of the plan, including any request for a waiver that is made as part of the plan submitted by the tribal government. If the plan is disapproved, the tribal government shall be informed, in writing, of the reasons for the disapproval and shall be given an opportunity to amend its plan or to petition the Secretary to reconsider such disapproval, including reconsidering the disapproval of any waiver requested by the Indian tribe.

(b)
 Job creation opportunities
(1)
 In general
Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, including any requirement of a program that is integrated under a plan under this chapter, a tribal government may use a percentage of the funds made available under this chapter (as determined under paragraph (2)) for the creation of employment opportunities, including providing private sector training placement under 
section 3409 of this title

 Private sector training placements
A tribal government participating in a demonstration program under this chapter is authorized to utilize funds available under such plan to place participants in training positions with private employers and pay such participants a training allowance or wage for a period not to exceed 12 months, if the tribal government obtains a written agreement from the private employer to provide on-the-job training to such participants and, upon satisfactory completion of the training period, to guarantee permanent employment to such participants for a minimum of 12 months.
