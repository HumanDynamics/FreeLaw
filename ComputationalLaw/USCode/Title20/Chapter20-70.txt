The total number of children treated as children described in paragraph (1)(B) shall not exceed the lessor of—
(i)
 the total number of children eligible under paragraph (1)(B) for the year prior to the initiation of the housing project on Federal property undergoing renovation or rebuilding; or

(B)
 Additional requirements
If the property described in subparagraph (A) is not owned by the Federal Government, is subject to taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, and thereby generates revenues for a local educational agency that is applying to receive a payment under this section, then the Secretary—
(i)
 shall require the local educational agency to provide certification from an appropriate official of the Department of Defense that the property is being used to provide military housing; and




(ii)
 shall reduce the amount of the payment under this section by an amount equal to the amount of revenue from such taxation received in the second preceding fiscal year by such local educational agency, unless the amount of such revenue was taken into account by the State for such second preceding fiscal year and already resulted in a reduction in the amount of State aid paid to such local educational agency.








(b)

(1)
 Basic support payments
(A)
 In general
From the amount appropriated under 
section 7714(b) of this title

(B)
 Eligibility
A local educational agency is eligible to receive a basic support payment under subparagraph (A) for a fiscal year with respect to a number of children determined under subsection (a)(1) of this section only if the number of children so determined with respect to such agency amounts to the lesser of—
(i)
 at least 400 such children; or




(ii)
 a number of such children which equals at least 3 percent of the total number of children who were in average daily attendance, during such year, at the schools of such agency and for whom such agency provided free public education.






(C)
 Maximum amount
The maximum amount that a local educational agency is eligible to receive under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the sum of the total weighted student units, as computed under subsection (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the greater of—
(i)
 one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of the State in which the local educational agency is located for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;




(ii)
 one-half of the average per-pupil expenditure of all of the States for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made;




(iii)
 the comparable local contribution rate certified by the State, as determined under regulations prescribed to carry out the Act of 
September 30, 1950
 (Public Law 874, 81st Congress), as such regulations were in effect on 
January 1, 1994
; or

(D)
 Data
If satisfactory data from the third preceding fiscal year are not available for any of the expenditures described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall use data from the most recent fiscal year for which data that are satisfactory to the Secretary are available.






(E)
 Special rule
For purposes of determining the comparable local contribution rate under subparagraph (C)(iii) for a local educational agency described in section 222.39(c)(3) of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, that had its comparable local contribution rate for fiscal year 1998 calculated pursuant to section 222.39 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, the Secretary shall determine such comparable local contribution rate as the rate upon which payments under this subsection for fiscal year 2000 were made to the local educational agency adjusted by the percentage increase or decrease in the per pupil expenditure in the State serving the local educational agency calculated on the basis of the second most recent preceding school year compared to the third most recent preceding school year for which school year data are available.






(F)
 Increase in local contribution rate due to unusual geographic factors
If the current expenditures in those local educational agencies which the Secretary has determined to be generally comparable to the local educational agency for which a computation is made under subparagraph (C) are not reasonably comparable because of unusual geographical factors which affect the current expenditures necessary to maintain, in such agency, a level of education equivalent to that maintained in such other agencies, then the Secretary shall increase the local contribution rate for such agency under subparagraph (C)(iii) by such an amount which the Secretary determines will compensate such agency for the increase in current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographical factors. The amount of any such supplementary payment may not exceed the per-pupil share (computed with regard to all children in average daily attendance), as determined by the Secretary, of the increased current expenditures necessitated by such unusual geographic factors.






(G)
 Beginning with fiscal year 2002, for the purpose of calculating a payment under this paragraph for a local educational agency whose local contribution rate was computed under subparagraph (C)(iii) for the previous year, the Secretary shall use a local contribution rate that is not less than 95 percent of the rate that the LEA received for the preceding year.

 the eligibility of a local educational agency for State aid for free public education; or
