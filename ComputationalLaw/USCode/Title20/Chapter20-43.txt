AMERICAN FOLKLIFE PRESERVATION

(a)
 The Congress hereby finds and declares—
(1)
 that the diversity inherent in American folklife has contributed greatly to the cultural richness of the Nation and has fostered a sense of individuality and identity among the American people;

 that the history of the United States effectively demonstrates that building a strong nation does not require the sacrifice of cultural differences;




(3)
 that American folklife has a fundamental influence on the desires, beliefs, values, and character of the American people;

 that it is appropriate and necessary for the Federal Government to support research and scholarship in American folklife in order to contribute to an understanding of the complex problems of the basic desires, beliefs, and values of the American people in both rural and urban areas;




(5)
 that the encouragement and support of American folklife, while primarily a matter for private and local initiative, is also an appropriate matter of concern to the Federal Government; and

 that it is in the interest of the general welfare of the Nation to preserve, support, revitalize, and disseminate American folklife traditions and arts.

 It is therefore the purpose of this subchapter to establish in the Library of Congress an American Folklife Center to preserve and pre­sent American folklife.

 Findings; purpose
(a)
 Findings
Congress finds as follows:
(1)
 Military service during a time of war is the highest sacrifice a citizen may make for his or her country.




(2)
 4,700,000 Americans served in World War I, 16,500,000 Americans served in World War II, 6,800,000 Americans served in the Korean Conflict, 9,200,000 Americans served in the Vietnam Conflict, 3,800,000 Americans served in the Persian Gulf War, and countless other Americans served in military engagements overseas throughout the 20th century.




(3)
 The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that there are almost 19,000,000 war veterans living in this Nation today.




(4)
 Today there are only approximately 3,400 living veterans of World War I, and of the some 6,000,000 veterans of World War II alive today, almost 1,500 die each day.




(5)
 Oral histories are of immeasurable value to historians, researchers, authors, journalists, film makers, scholars, students, and citizens of all walks of life.




(6)
 War veterans possess an invaluable resource in their memories of the conflicts in which they served, and can provide a rich history of our Nation and its people through the retelling of those memories, yet frequently those who served during times of conflict are reticent to family and friends about their experiences.




(7)
 It is in the Nation’s best interest to collect and catalog oral histories of American war veterans so that future generations will have original sources of information regarding the lives and times of those who served in war and the conditions under which they endured, so that Americans will always remember those who served in war and may learn first-hand of the heroics, tediousness, horrors, and triumphs of war.




(8)
 The Library of Congress, as the Nation’s oldest Federal cultural institution and largest and most inclusive library in human history (with nearly 119,000,000 items in its multimedia collection)

 is an appropriate repository to collect, preserve, and make available to the public an archive of these oral histories.

(b)
 Purpose
It is the purpose of this subchapter to create a new federally sponsored, authorized, and funded program that will coordinate at a national level the collection of video and audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of American war veterans, and to assist and encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of this Nation’s war veterans so that Americans of all current and future generations may hear directly from veterans and better appreciate the realities of war and the sacrifices made by those who served in uniform during wartime.
