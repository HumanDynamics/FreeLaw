“(a)
 
Findings

“(1)
 in the last 10 years there has arisen a new global economy in which trade, technological development, investment, and services form an integrated system; and in this system these activities affect each other and the health of the United States economy;




“(2)
 the United States is confronted with a fundamental disequilibrium in its trade and current account balances and a rapid increase in its net external debt;
