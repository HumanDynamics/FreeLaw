Chapter 16
WINE TRADE
 Congressional findings and purposes
(a)
 Congress finds that—
(1)
 there is a substantial imbalance in international wine trade resulting, in part, from the relative accessibility enjoyed by foreign wines to the United States market while the United States wine industry faces restrictive tariff and nontariff barriers in virtually every existing or potential foreign market;




(2)
 the restricted access to foreign markets and the continued low prices for United States wine and grape products adversely affect the economic position of our Nation’s winemakers and grape growers, as well as all other domestic sectors that depend upon wine production;




(3)
 the competitive position of United States wine in international trade has been weakened by foreign trade practices, high domestic interest rates, and unfavorable foreign exchange rates;




(4)
 wine consumption per capita is very low in many major non-wine producing markets and the demand potential for United States wine is significant; and




(5)
 the United States winemaking industry has the capacity and the ability to export substantial volumes of wine and an increase in United States wine exports will create new jobs, improve this Nation’s balance of trade, and otherwise strengthen the national economy.




(b)
 The purposes of this chapter are—
(1)
 to provide wine consumers with the greatest possible choice of wines from wine-producing countries;




(2)
 to encourage the initiation of an export promotion program to develop, maintain, and expand foreign markets for United States wine; and




(3)
 to achieve greater access to foreign markets for United States wine and grape products through the reduction or elimination of tariff barriers and nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in wine.




 Definitions
 Designation of major wine trading countries
(a)
 The Trade Representative shall designate as a major wine trading country each foreign country, or group of foreign countries represented as an economic union, that, in the judgment of the Trade Representative—
(1)
 is a potential significant market for United States wine; and




(2)
 maintains tariff barriers or nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in United States wine.




(b)
 In deciding, for purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, whether a foreign country or group of countries maintains nontariff barriers to (or other distortions of) trade in United States wine, the Trade Representative shall take into account—
(1)
 the review and report required under section 854(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (
19 U.S.C. 2135
 note);




(2)
 such relevant actions that may have been taken by that country or group since that review was conducted; and




(3)
 such information as may be submitted under 
section 2805 of this title
 by representatives of the wine and grape products industries in the United States, as well as other sources.

(A)
 a description of each act, policy, and practice (and of its legal basis and operation) in that country that constitutes a tariff barrier or nontariff barrier to (or other distortion of) trade in United States wine (and that description shall be based upon an updating of the report that was submitted to the Congress under section 854(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979);




(B)
 an assessment of the extent to which each such act, policy, or practice is subject to international agreements to which the United States is a party;

(c)
 Enforcement of rights
If the President, after taking into account information and advice received under subsections (a) and (b) of this section, 
section 2805 of this title
 or from other sources, determines that action is appropriate to respond to any act, policy, or practice of a major wine trading country constitutes a tariff barrier or nontariff barrier to (or other distortion of) trade in United States wine and—
(1)
 is inconsistent with the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement; or




(2)
 is unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory and burdens or restricts United States commerce;





the President, shall take all appropriate and feasible action under the Trade Act of 1974 [
19 U.S.C. 2101
 et seq.] to enforce the rights of the United States under any such trade agreement or to obtain the elimination of such act, policy, or practice.
