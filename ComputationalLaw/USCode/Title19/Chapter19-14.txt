(a)
 Agreement authority
(1)

 that the cultural patrimony of the State Party is in jeopardy from the pillage of archaeological or ethnological materials of the State Party;




(B)
 that the State Party has taken measures consistent with the Convention to protect its cultural patrimony;




(C)
 that—
(i)
 the application of the import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 with respect to archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party, if applied in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented within a reasonable period of time, by those nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material, would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage, and




(ii)
 remedies less drastic than the application of the restrictions set forth in such section are not available; and






(D)
 that the application of the import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 in the particular circumstances is consistent with the general interest of the international community in the interchange of cultural property among nations for scientific, cultural, and educational purposes;





the President may, subject to the provisions of this chapter, take the actions described in paragraph (2).




(2)
 Authority of President
For purposes of paragraph (1), the President may enter into—
(A)
 a bilateral agreement with the State Party to apply the import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 to the archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party the pillage of which is creating the jeopardy to the cultural patrimony of the State Party found to exist under paragraph (1)(A); or




(B)
 a multilateral agreement with the State Party and with one or more other nations (whether or not a State Party) under which the United States will apply such restrictions, and the other nations will apply similar restrictions, with respect to such material.






(3)
 Requests
A request made to the United States under article 9 of the Convention by a State Party must be accompanied by a written statement of the facts known to the State Party that relate to those matters with respect to which determinations must be made under subparagraphs (A) through (D) of paragraph (1).

 of its archaeological and ethnological materials under circumstances in which such exchange does not jeopardize its cultural patrimony.






(b)
 Effective period
The President may not enter into any agreement under subsection (a) of this section which has an effective period beyond the close of the five-year period beginning on the date on which such agreement enters into force with respect to the United States.




(c)
 Restrictions on entering into agreements
(1)
 In general
The President may not enter into a bilateral or multilateral agreement authorized by subsection (a) of this section unless the application of the import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 with respect to archaeological or ethnological material of the State Party making a request to the United States under article 9 of the Convention will be applied in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented, by those nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material.






(2)
 Exception to restrictions
Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President may enter into an agreement if he determines that a nation individually having a significant import trade in such material is not implementing, or is not likely to implement, similar restrictions, but—
(A)
 such restrictions are not essential to deter a serious situation of pillage, and




(B)
 the application of the import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 in concert with similar restrictions implemented, or to be implemented, by other nations (whether or not State Parties) individually having a significant import trade in such material would be of substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage.






(d)
 Suspension of import restrictions under agreements

(1)
 have not implemented within a reasonable period of time import restrictions that are similar to those set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
, or




(2)
 are not implementing such restrictions satisfactorily with the result that no substantial benefit in deterring a serious situation of pillage in the State Party concerned is being obtained,





the President shall suspend the implementation of the import restrictions under 
section 2606 of this title
 until such time as the nations take appropriate corrective action.


(e)
 Extension of agreements
The President may extend any agreement that enters into force with respect to the United States for additional periods of not more than five years each if the President determines that—

 submit to the Committee such information regarding the request or proposal (including, if applicable, information from the State Party with respect to the implementation of emergency action under

 Emergency implementation of import restrictions
(a)
 “Emergency condition” defined
For purposes of this section, the term “emergency condition” means, with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of any State Party, that such material is—
(1)
 a newly discovered type of material which is of importance for the understanding of the history of mankind and is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation;




(2)
 identifiable as coming from any site recognized to be of high cultural significance if such site is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation which is, or threatens to be, of crisis proportions; or




(3)
 a part of the remains of a particular culture or civilization, the record of which is in jeopardy from pillage, dismantling, dispersal, or fragmentation which is, or threatens to be, of crisis proportions;





and application of the import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 on a temporary basis would, in whole or in part, reduce the incentive for such pillage, dismantling, dispersal or fragmentation.


(b)
 Presidential action
Subject to subsection (c) of this section, if the President determines that an emergency condition applies with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of any State Party, the President may apply the import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 with respect to such material.




(c)
 Limitations
(1)
 The President may not implement this section with respect to the archaeological or ethnological materials of any State Party unless the State Party has made a request described in 
section 2602(a) of this title
 to the United States and has supplied information which supports a determination that an emergency condition exists.




(2)
 In taking action under subsection (b) of this section with respect to any State Party, the President shall consider the views and recommendations contained in the Committee report required under 
section 2605(f)(3) of this title
 if the report is submitted to the President before the close of the ninety-day period beginning on the day on which the President submitted information to the Committee under 
section 2602(f)(2) of this title
 on the request of the State Party under 
section 2602(a) of this title
.




(3)
 No import restrictions set forth in 
section 2606 of this title
 may be applied under this section to the archaeological or ethnological materials of any State Party for more than five years after the date on which the request of a State Party under 
section 2602(a) of this title
 is made to the United States. This period may be extended by the President for three more years if the President determines that the emergency condition continues to apply with respect to the archaeological or ethnological material. However, before taking such action, the President shall request and consider, if received within ninety days, a report of the Committee setting forth its recommendations, together with the reasons therefor, as to whether such import restrictions shall be extended.




(4)
 The import restrictions under this section may continue to apply in whole or in part, if before their expiration under paragraph (3), there has entered into force with respect to the archaeological or ethnological materials an agreement under 
section 2602 of this title
 or an agreement with a State Party to which the Senate has given its advice and consent to ratification. Such import restrictions may continue to apply for the duration of the agreement.
