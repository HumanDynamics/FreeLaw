 Importing and exporting authorities
(a)
 In the United States
For purposes of this chapter—

(2)
 the exporting authority shall be the Bureau of the Census.




(b)
 Of other countries
The President shall publish in the Federal Register a list of all Participants, and all exporting authorities and importing authorities of Participants. The President shall update the list as necessary.




 Statement of policy

 Enforcement
(a)
 In general
In addition to the enforcement provisions set forth in subsection (b)—
(1)
 a civil penalty of not to exceed $10,000 may be imposed on any person who violates, or attempts to violate, any license, order, or regulation issued under this chapter; and




(2)

 Technical assistance
The President may direct the appropriate agencies of the United States Government to make available technical assistance to countries seeking to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.
 Sense of Congress
(a)
 Ongoing process
It is the sense of the Congress that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, officially launched on 
January 1, 2003
, is an ongoing process. The President should work with Participants to strengthen the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme through the adoption of measures for the sharing of statistics on the production of and trade in rough diamonds, and for monitoring the effectiveness of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in stemming trade in diamonds the importation or exportation of which is not controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.




(b)
 Statistics and reporting
It is the sense of the Congress that under Annex III to the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, Participants recognized that reliable and comparable data on the international trade in rough diamonds are an essential tool for the effective implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. Therefore, the executive branch should continue to—
(1)
 keep and publish statistics on imports and exports of rough diamonds under subheadings 7102.10.00, 7102.21, and 7102.31.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States;




(2)
 make these statistics available for analysis by interested parties and by Participants; and




(3)
 take a leadership role in negotiating a standardized methodology among Participants for reporting statistics on imports and exports of rough diamonds.




 Kimberley Process Implementation Coordinating Committee
 Reports
(a)
 Annual reports
Not later than 1 year after 
April 25, 2003
, and every 12 months thereafter for such period as this chapter is in effect, the President shall transmit to the Congress a report—
(1)
 describing actions taken by countries that have exported rough diamonds to the United States during the preceding 12-month period to control the exportation of the diamonds through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme;




(2)
 describing whether there is statistical information or other evidence that would indicate efforts to circumvent the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, including cutting rough diamonds for the purpose of circumventing the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme;




(3)
 identifying each country that, during the preceding 12-month period, exported rough diamonds to the United States and was exporting rough diamonds not controlled through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, if the failure to do so has significantly increased the likelihood that those diamonds not so controlled are being imported into the United States; and




(4)
 identifying any problems or obstacles encountered in the implementation of this chapter or the Kimberly

 Process Certification Scheme.

The requirement to issue a semiannual report with respect to a country under this subsection shall remain in effect until such time as the country is controlling the importation and exportation of rough diamonds through the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme.
