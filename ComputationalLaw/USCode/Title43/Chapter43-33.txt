The purpose of this limitation on suits is to insure that, after the expiration of a reasonable period of time, the right, title, and interest of the United States, the Natives, and the State of Alaska will vest with certainty and finality and may be relied upon by all other persons in their relations with the State, the Natives, and the United States.




(b)
 Land selection; suspension and extension of rights
In the event that the State initiates litigation or voluntarily becomes a party to litigation to contest the authority of the United States to legislate on the subject matter or the legality of this chapter, all rights of land selection granted to the State by the Alaska Statehood Act shall be suspended as to any public lands which are determined by the Secretary to be potentially valuable for mineral development, timber, or other commercial purposes, and no selections shall be made, no tentative approvals shall be granted, and no patents shall be issued for such lands during the pendency of such litigation. In the event of such suspension, the State’s right of land selection pursuant to section 6 of the Alaska Statehood Act shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time the selection right was suspended.




 Withdrawal of public lands
(a)
 Description of withdrawn public lands; exceptions; National Wildlife Refuge lands exception; time of withdrawal
(1)

(A)
 The lands in each township that encloses all or part of any Native village identified pursuant to subsection (b) of this section;




(B)
 The lands in each township that is contiguous to or corners on the township that encloses all or part of such Native village; and




(C)
 The lands in each township that is contiguous to or corners on a township containing lands withdrawn by paragraph (B) of this subsection.

(3)
(A)
 If the Secretary determines that the lands withdrawn by subsections (a)(1) and (2) hereof are insufficient to permit a Village or Regional Corporation to select the acreage it is entitled to select, the Secretary shall withdraw three times the deficiency from the nearest unreserved, vacant and unappropriated public lands. In making this withdrawal the Secretary shall, insofar as possible, withdraw public lands of a character similar to those on which the village is located and in order of their proximity to the center of the Native village: 
Provided
, That if the Secretary, pursuant to section 1616, and 1621(e) of this title determines there is a need to expand the boundaries of a National Wildlife Refuge to replace any acreage selected in the Wildlife Refuge System by the Village Corporation the withdrawal under this section shall not include lands in the Refuge.




(B)
 The Secretary shall make the withdrawal provided for in subsection (3)(A) hereof on the basis of the best available information within sixty days of

 Within two and one-half years from 
December 18, 1971
, the Secretary shall review all of the villages listed in subsection (b)(1) hereof, and a village shall not be eligible for land benefits under section 1613(a) and (b) of this title, and any withdrawal for such village shall expire, if the Secretary determines that—
(A)
 less than twenty-five Natives were residents of the village on the 1970 census enumeration date as shown by the census or other evidence satisfactory to the Secretary, who shall make findings of fact in each instance; or




(B)
 the village is of a modern and urban character, and the majority of the residents are non-Native.





Any Native group made ineligible by this subsection shall be considered under 
section 1613(h) of this title
.




(3)
 Native villages not listed in subsection (b)(1) hereof shall be eligible for land and benefits under this chapter and lands shall be withdrawn pursuant to this section if the Secretary within two and one-half years from 
December 18, 1971
, determines that—
(A)
 twenty-five or more Natives were residents of an established village on the 1970 census enumeration date as shown by the census or other evidence satisfactory to the Secretary, who shall make findings of fact in each instance; and




(B)
 the village is not of a modern and urban character, and a majority of the residents are Natives.






 Native land selections
(a)
 Acreage limitation; proximity of selections and size of sections and units; waiver
(1)
 During a period of three years from 
December 18, 1971
, the Village Corporation for each Native village identified pursuant to 
section 1610 of this title
 shall select, in accordance with rules established by the Secretary, all of the township or townships in which any part of the village is located, plus an area that will make the total selection equal to the acreage to which the village is entitled under 
section 1613 of this title
. The selection shall be made from lands withdrawn by 
section 1610(a) of this title
: 
Provided
, That no Village Corporation may select more than 69,120 acres from lands withdrawn by 
section 1610(a)(2) of this title
, and not more than 69,120 acres from the National Wildlife Refuge System, and not more than 69,120 acres in a National Forest: 
Provided further
, That when a Village Corporation selects the surface estate to lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System or Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 4, the Regional Corporation, for that region may select the subsurface estate in an equal acreage from other lands withdrawn in 
section 1610(a) of this title
 within the region, if possible.




(2)
 Selections made under this subsection (a) of this section shall be contiguous and in reasonably compact tracts, except as separated by bodies of water or by lands which are unavailable for selection, and shall be in whole sections and, wherever feasible, in units of not less than 1,280 acres: 
Provided
, That the Secretary in his discretion and upon the request of the concerned Village Corporation, may waive the whole section requirement where—
(A)
(i)
 a portion of available public lands of a section is separated from other available public lands in the same section by lands unavailable for selection or by a meanderable body of water;




(ii)
 such waiver will not result in small isolated parcels of available public land remaining after conveyance of selected lands to Native Corporations; and




(iii)
 such waiver would result in a better land ownership pattern or improved land or resource management opportunity; or






(B)
 the remaining available public lands in the section have been selected and will be conveyed to another Native Corporation under this chapter.






(b)
 Allocation; reallocation considerations
The difference between twenty-two million acres and the total acreage selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be allocated by the Secretary among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) on the basis of the number of Natives enrolled in each region. Each Regional Corporation shall, not later than 
October 1, 2005
, reallocate such acreage among the Native villages within the region on an equitable basis after considering historic use, subsistence needs, and population. The action of the Secretary or the Corporation shall not be subject to judicial review. Each Village Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands withdrawn by 
section 1610(a) of this title
.




(c)
 Computation
The difference between thirty-eight million acres and the 22 million acres selected by Village Corporations pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be allocated among the eleven Regional Corporations (which excludes the Regional Corporation for southeastern Alaska) as follows:
(1)
 The number of acres each Regional Corporation is entitled to receive shall be computed (A) by determining on the basis of available data the percentages of all land in Alaska (excluding the southeastern region) that is within each of the eleven regions, (B) by applying that percentage to thirty-eight million acres reduced by the acreage in the southeastern region that is to be selected pursuant to 
section 1615 of this title
, and (C) by deducting from the figure so computed the number of acres within that region selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section.




(2)
 In the event that the total number of acres selected within a region pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of the section exceeds the percentage of the reduced thirty-eight million acres allotted to that region pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section, that region shall not be entitled to receive any lands under this subsection (c). For each region so affected the difference between the acreage calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section and the acreage selected pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be deducted from the acreage calculated under subsection (c)(1)(C) of this section for the remaining regions which will select lands under this subsection (c). The reductions shall be apportioned among the remaining regions so that each region’s share of the total reduction bears the same proportion to the total reduction as the total land area in that region (as calculated pursuant to subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section 
1
1
 So in original. Probably should be followed by a closing parenthesis.
 bears to the total land area in all of the regions whose allotments are to be reduced pursuant to this paragraph.




(3)
 Before the end of the fourth year after 
December 18, 1971
, each Regional Corporation shall select the acreage allocated to it from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to 
section 1610(a)(1) of this title
, and from the lands within the region withdrawn pursuant to 
section 1610(a)(3) of this title
 to the extent lands withdrawn pursuant to 
section 1610(a)(1) of this title
 are not sufficient to satisfy its allocation: 
Provided
, That within the lands withdrawn by 
section 1610(a)(1) of this title
 the Regional Corporation may select only even numbered townships in even numbered ranges, and only odd numbered townships in odd numbered ranges.




(4)
 Where the public lands consist only of the mineral estate, or portion thereof, which is reserved by the United States upon patent of the balance of the estate under one of the public land laws, other than this chapter, the Regional Corporations may select as follows:
(A)
 Where such public lands were not withdrawn pursuant to 
section 1610(a)(3) of this title
, but are surrounded by or contiguous to lands withdrawn pursuant to 
section 1610(a)(3) of this title
, and filed upon for selection by a Regional Corporation, the Corporation may, upon request, have such public land included in its selection and considered by the Secretary to be withdrawn and properly selected.




(B)
 Where such public lands were withdrawn pursuant to 
section 1610(a)(1) of this title
 and are required to be selected by paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Regional Corporation may, at its option, exclude such public lands from its selection.




(C)
 Where such public lands are surrounded by or contiguous to subsurface lands obtained by a Regional Corporation under subsections 
2
2
 So in original. Probably should be “subsection”.
 (a) or (b) of this section, the Corporation may, upon request, have such public land conveyed to it.




(D)
(i)
 A Regional Corporation which elects to obtain public lands under subparagraph (C) shall be limited to a total of not more than 12,000 acres. Selection by a Regional Corporation of in lieu surface acres under subparagraph (E) pursuant to an election under subparagraph (C) shall not be made from any lands within a conservation system unit (as that term is defined by 
section 3102(4) of title 16
).




(ii)
 An election to obtain the public lands described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) shall include all available parcels within the township in which the public lands are located.




(iii)
 For purposes of this subparagraph and subparagraph (C), the term “Regional Corporation” shall refer only to Doyon, Limited.






(E)
 Where the Regional Corporation elects to obtain such public lands under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of this paragraph, it may select, within ninety days of receipt of notice from the Secretary, the surface estate in an equal acreage from other public lands withdrawn by the Secretary for that purpose. Such selections shall be in units no smaller than a whole section, except where the remaining entitlement is less than six hundred and forty acres, or where an entire section is not available. Where possible, selections shall be of lands from which the subsurface estate was selected by that Regional Corporation pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section or 
section 1613(h)(9) of this title
, and, where possible, all selections made under this section shall be contiguous to lands already selected by the Regional Corporation or a Village Corporation. The Secretary is authorized, as necessary, to withdraw up to two times the acreage entitlement of the in lieu surface estate from vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved public lands from which the Regional Corporation may select such in lieu surface estate except that the Secretary may withdraw public lands which had been previously withdrawn pursuant to sub
section 1616(d)(1) of this title
.




(F)
 No mineral estate or in lieu surface estate shall be available for selection within the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska or within Wildlife Refuges as the boundaries of those refuges exist on 
December 18, 1971
.






(5)
 Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (4) shall apply, notwithstanding the failure of the Regional Corporation to have appealed the rejection of a selection during the conveyance of the relevant surface estate.




(d)
 Village Corporation for Native village at Dutch Harbor; lands and improvements and patent for Village Corporation
To insure that the Village Corporation for the Native village at Dutch Harbor, if found eligible for land grants under this chapter, has a full opportunity to select lands within and near the village, no federally owned lands, whether improved or not, shall be disposed of pursuant to the Federal surplus property disposal laws for a period of two years from 
December 18, 1971
. The Village Corporation may select such lands and improvements and receive patent to them pursuant to 
section 1613(a) of this title
.




(e)
 Disputes over land selection rights and boundaries; arbitration
Any dispute over the land selection rights and the boundaries of Village Corporations shall be resolved by a board of arbitrators consisting of one person selected by each of the Village Corporations involved, and an additional one or two persons, whichever is needed to make an odd number of arbitrators, such additional person or persons to be selected by the arbitrators selected by the Village Corporations.




(f)
 Combining entitlements and reallocations
(1)
 The entitlements received by any Village Corporation under subsection (a) of this section and the reallocations made to the Village Corporation under subsection (b) of this section may be combined, at the discretion of the Secretary, without—
(A)
 increasing or decreasing the combined entitlement; or




(B)
 increasing the limitation on selections of Wildlife Refuge System land, National Forest System land, or State-selected land under subsection (a) of this section.






(2)
 The combined entitlement under paragraph (1) may be fulfilled from selections under subsection (a) or (b) of this section without regard to the entitlement specified in the selection application.




(3)
 All selections under a combined entitlement under paragraph (1) shall be adjudicated and conveyed in compliance with this chapter.




(4)
 Except in a case in which a survey has been contracted for 
December 10, 2004

 Until the obligations of the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services under section 12(b)(5) and (6) of this Act [subsec. (b)(5), (6) of this note] are otherwise fulfilled: (a) Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, may, by using the account established in subsection 12(b)(7)(iv) [subsec.

40 U.S.C. 484(e)(3)
 [now 
40 U.S.C. 545(b)
] to be offered Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated for a period of 90 days so as to aid in the fulfillment of the Secretary’s program purposes under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [this chapter]: 
Provided
, That nothing in these subsections 12(b)(7)(i)(b) or (ii) [subsec. (b)(7)(i)(b) or (ii) of this note] shall be construed to establish, enlarge or diminish authority of the Administrator or the Secretary within the State of Alaska. Prior to any disposition under subsection 12(b)(7)(i)(b) [subsec. (b)(7)(i)(b) of this note], the Administrator shall notify the governing body of the locality where such property is located and any appropriate state agency, and no such disposition shall be made if such governing body or state agency, within ninety days of such notification formally advises the Administrator that it objects to the proposed disposition.




“(ii)
 Subject to the exceptions stated in section 12(b)(9) [subsec. (b)(9) of this note], and notwithstanding the foregoing subsection 12(b)(7)(i) [subsec. (b)(7)(i) of this note] and any provision of any other law or any implementing regulation inconsistent with this subsection, until the obligations of the Secretary and the Administrator of General Services under section 12(b)(5) and (6) [subsec. (b)(5) and (6) of this note] are otherwise fulfilled:
“(A)
 concurrently with the commencement of screening of any excess real property, wherever located, for utilization by Federal agencies, the Administrator of General Services shall notify the Region that such property may be available for conveyance to the Region upon negotiated sale. Within fifteen days of the date of receipt of such notice, the Region may advise the Administrator that there is a tentative need for the property to fulfill the obligations established under section 12(b)(5) and (6) [subsec. (b)(5) and (6) of this note]. If the Administrator determines the property should be disposed of by transfer to the Region, the Administrator or other appropriate Federal official shall promptly transfer such property;




“(B)
 no disposition or conveyance of property under this subsection to the Region shall be made until the Administrator, after notice to affected State and local governments, has provided to them such opportunity to obtain the property as is recognized in title 40, United States Code and the regulations thereunder for the disposition or conveyance of surplus property; and




“(C)
 as used in this subsection, ‘real property’ means any land or interests in land owned or held by the United States or any Federal agency, any improvements on such land or rights to their use or exploitation, and any personal property related to the land.






“(iii)
 If the Region accepts any conveyance under section 12(b)(7)(i) or (ii) [subsec. (b)(7)(i) or (ii) of this note], it shall be in exchange for acres or acre-equivalents as provided in subparagraph I(C)(2)(e) of the document referred to in this section, except that, after the obligation of the Secretary and the Administrator under subparagraph I(C)(2)(g) of that document has been fulfilled, the acre-equivalents under subparagraph I(C)(2)(e)(iii)(A) shall be one-half the valued increment therein stated. The entitlement of the Region under section 12(b) of this Act [subsec. (b) of this note] shall be reduced by the number of acres or acre-equivalents attributed to the Region under this subsection. The Secretary and the Administrator are directed to execute an agreement with the Region which shall conform substantially to the ‘Memorandum of Understanding Regarding the Implementation of Section 12(b)(7)’, dated 
September 10, 1982

(b)(7)(vii) of this note], or paying for the conveyance of property pursuant to subsections 12(b)(7)(i) or (ii) [subsec. (b)(7)(i), (ii) of this note]. The balance of the account shall be the sum of (1) the acre-equivalent exchange value established by paragraph I(C)(2)(e)(iii)(A) of the document referred to in this subsection, of the unfulfilled entitlement of Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, [on] 
December 2, 1980
, to acre or acre-equivalents under paragraph I(C)(2)(g) of the document referred to in this subsection 12(b) [subsec. (b) of this note] and (2) one-half the acre or acre-equivalent exchange value under subparagraph I(C)(2)(e)(iii)(A) of seven townships fewer than the unfulfilled entitlement of the Region on the same date to acres or acre-equivalents under paragraph I(C)(1) of the document referred to in this section. The balance of the property account shall be adjusted in accordance with subsection 12(b)(7)(iii) [subsec. (b)(7)(iii) of this note] to reflect transfers or successful bids under section 12(b)(5) and (6) of this section [subsec. (b)(5) and (6) of this note] or payments of forfeited deposits, penalties, or other assessments imposed under a valid bid or sales contract on Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated.




“(v)
 The amount charged against the Treasury account established under subsection 12(b)(7)(iv) [subsec. (b)(7)(iv) of this note] for sales or transfers of property made pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, 40 U.S.C. sec. 471 et seq.

40 U.S.C. 485(b)
 [now 
40 U.S.C. 572(a)
], as amended.




“(vi)
 The basis for computing gain or loss on subsequent sale or other disposition of lands or interests in land conveyed to Cook Inlet Region, Incorporated, under this subsection, for purposes of any Federal, State or local tax imposed on or measured by income, shall be the fair value of such land or interest in land at the time of receipt. The amount charged against Cook Inlet’s entitlement under I(C)(2)(e) of the document referred to in subsection (b) of this section [subsec. (b) of this note] shall be prima facie evidence of such fair value.




“(vii)
 Notwithstanding the definition of ‘property’ found in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [see 
40 U.S.C. 102(9)
], as used in this section 12(b)(7) [subsec. (b)(7) of this note], ‘property’ means any property—real, personal (including intangible assets sold or offered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Resolution Trust Corporation, such as financial instruments, notes, loans, and bonds), or mixed—owned, held, or controlled by the United States (including that in a corporate capacity or as a receiver or conservator, or such other similar fiduciary relationship), and offered for sale by any agency or instrumentality of the United States, including but not limited to the General Services Administration, Department of Defense, Department of the Interior, Department of Agriculture, Department of Housing and Urban Development, the United States Courts and any Government corporation, agency or instrumentality subject to chapter 91 of title 31, United States Code; real property means any land or interest in land or option to purchase land, any improvements on such lands, or rights to their use or exploitation.




“(viii)

section 1608(f) of this title

section 1304 of title 31
 of the United States Code. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay such amounts to the appropriate Corporation out of funds in the Treasury: 
Provided
, That if the lands from which the proceeds and interest entitlement are derived have not been conveyed to the selecting Native Corporation at the time the Secretary makes his final determination, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to pay such amount into the escrow account where it will earn interest and be disbursed in the same manner as other proceeds and interest.”

The boundaries of the lands as defined and conveyed by the interim conveyance shall not be altered but may then be redescribed, if need be, in reference to the plat of survey. The Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments to insure that the recipient receives his full entitlement. Where the term “patent,” or a derivative thereof, is used in this chapter unless the context precludes such construction, it shall be deemed to include “interim conveyance,” and the conveyances of land to Natives and Native Corporations provided for this chapter shall be as fully effectuated by the issuance of interim conveyances as by the issuance of patents.

Should such lands no longer be available, the Secretary may withdraw public lands that are vacant, unreserved, and unappropriated, except that the Secretary may withdraw public lands which had been previously withdrawn pursuant to 
section 1616(d) of this title
. Any subsequent selection by the Village Corporation shall be in the manner provided in this chapter for such original selections.
