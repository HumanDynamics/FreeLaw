In the event no agreement can be reached on the modifications to the plan which, in the opinion of the Secretary, will bring such plan into compliance with the requirements of this subchapter, then the Secretary shall disapprove the plan and notify both the surface owner and the person submitting the plan of the decision.




(C)
 The 60-day period referred to in subparagraph (A) may be extended by the Secretary where additional time is required to comply with other applicable requirements of law.




(D)
 The Secretary shall suspend or revoke a plan of operation whenever the Secretary determines, on the Secretary’s own motion or on a motion made by the surface owner, that the person conducting mineral activities is in substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of an approved plan of operations and has failed to remedy a violation after notice from the Secretary within the time required by the Secretary.






(4)
 Final approval of a plan of operations under this subsection shall be conditioned upon compliance with subsections (e) and (g) of this section.




(g)
 Fee
The fee referred to in subsection (f)(1) of this section shall be—

 paid to the surface owner by the person submitting the plan of operations;




(2)
 paid in advance of any mineral activities or at such other time or times as may be agreed to by the surface owner and the person conducting such activities; and




(3)
 established by the Secretary taking into account the acreage involved and the degree of potential disruption to existing surface uses during mineral activities (including the loss of income to the surface owner and such surface owner’s operations due to the loss or impairment of existing surface uses for the duration of the mineral activities), except that such fee shall not exceed the fair market value for the surface of the land.




(h)
 Reclamation
Lands affected by mineral activities under a plan of operations approved pursuant to subsection (f)(3) of this section shall be reclaimed, to the maximum extent practicable, to a condition capable of supporting the uses to which such lands were capable of supporting prior to surface disturbance.

(i)
 State law
(1)
 Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as affecting any reclamation, bonding, inspection, enforcement, air or water quality standard or requirement of any State law or regulation which may be applicable to mineral activities on lands subject to this subchapter to the extent that such law or regulation is not inconsistent with this title.

(1)
 Whenever the surface owner of any land subject to this subchapter has suffered any permanent damages to crops or tangible improvements of the surface owner, or any permanent loss of income due to loss or impairment of grazing, or other uses of the land by the surface owner, if such damages or loss result from—
(A)
 any mineral activity undertaken without the consent of the surface owner under subsection (c) of this section or an authorization by the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section; or




(B)
 the failure of the person conducting mineral activities to remedy to the satisfaction of the Secretary any substantial noncompliance with the terms and conditions of a plan under subsection (f) of this section;





the surface owner may bring an action in the appropriate United States district court for, and the court may award, double damages plus costs for willful misconduct or gross negligence.
