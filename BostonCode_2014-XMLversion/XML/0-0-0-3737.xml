							<TAB tab-count="1"/>The construction or rehabilitation of new large-scale real estate development projects in the City of Boston, especially in conjunction with other market forces, results in lost employment opportunities for Boston&apos;s low or moderate income residents who have their existing employment or promotional opportunities diminished, or who are unable to successfully compete for new employment opportunities resulting from such construction or rehabilitation. The existence of such unemployment or underemployment in the City of Boston constitutes a serious and growing menace, injurious and inimical to the safety, health, morals and welfare of the residents of the City of Boston and sound growth of the City of Boston; and the existence of such lack of adequate employment opportunities contributes substantially to crime necessitating excessive and disproportionate expenditure of public funds for the preservation of the public health and safety, for crime prevention, correction, prosecution, punishment, and the treatment of juvenile delinquency and for the maintenance of adequate police, fire and accident protection and other public services and facilities, which constitutes an economic and social liability, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of the City of Boston. Because of the economic and social interdependence of different areas within the City of Boston, the full employment of all those who can and wish to work not only in the “downtown” commercial areas but also in decadent areas is necessary in order to: promote the sound growth of the City of Boston; to achieve permanent and comprehensive elimination of existing slums and substandard and decadent conditions; and to prevent the recurrence of such substandard or decadent conditions or their development in other parts of the City of Boston; and the abandonment of existing industries and employment opportunities in such areas exacerbates decadent or substandard conditions; and the menace of underemployment or unemployment is beyond remedy and control solely by the regulatory process in the exercise of the police power and such menace has not been dealt with effectively by the ordinary operations of private enterprise. Limited public resources require that government dollars for job training, re-training, adult literacy and job counseling programs be highly leveraged by private investment; and the development of employment training and employment opportunities eliminating underemployment and unemployment in the City of Boston is a public use and purpose for which public money may be expended; and the aforesaid conditions have not been corrected by the ordinary operations of private enterprise in a regulated market; now, the following is declared to be in the public interest.</PARA>
