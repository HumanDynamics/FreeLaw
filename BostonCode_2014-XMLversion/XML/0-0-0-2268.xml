						<PARA>
							<TAB tab-count="1"/>A serious public emergency exists in the City of Boston which has been accentuated by the use by tax-exempt institutions of buildings having or potentially having a residential use. Such use has (a) contributed to the removal of residential housing from the market while a severe shortage exists; (b) contributed to the destruction and decay in affected residential neighborhoods; (c) created areas of the City where public order is difficult to enforce; and (d) deprived the City of needed tax revenues. In addition, this emergency cannot be dealt with solely by the operation of the private rental housing market nor by existing ordinances and unless the removal of residential units is additionally regulated and controlled, such emergency and the displacement resulting therefrom will produce serious threats to the public health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of Boston. Furthermore, public regulation is necessary in order to provide residents with a sufficient supply of decent, affordable housing, to strengthen residential neighborhoods, to encourage public order and to preserve the City&apos;s tax base. Now, therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in it by law, including without limitation, Article 2, as amended, and Articles 47 and 89 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and Chapter 797 of the Acts of 1969, as amended, Chapter 450 of the Acts of 1889, Chapter 355 of the Acts of 1960, Chapter 256 of the Acts of 1953, Chapter 22 of the Acts of 1949, Chapter 473 of the Acts of 1953 and Chapter 314 of the Acts of 1962 and M.G.L.
