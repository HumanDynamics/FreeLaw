<chapeau style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The Congress finds that the American public should be informed about the health hazards that may result from the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages, and has determined that it would be beneficial to provide a clear, nonconfusing reminder of such hazards, and that there is a need for national uniformity in such reminders in order to avoid the promulgation of incorrect or misleading information and to minimize burdens on interstate commerce. The Congress finds that requiring such reminders on all containers of alcoholic beverages is appropriate and necessary in view of the substantial role of the Federal Government in promoting the health and safety of the Nation’s population. It is therefore the policy of the Congress, and the purpose of this subchapter, to exercise the full reach of the Federal Government’s constitutional powers in order to establish a comprehensive Federal program, in connection with the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in or affecting interstate commerce, to deal with the provision of warning or other information with respect to any relationship between the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages and health, so that—</chapeau><paragraph style="-uslm-lc:I12" class="indent1" id="id004d1a6c-5568-11e4-a7b0-d4bdcbf99c57" identifier="/us/usc/t27/s213/1"><num value="1">(1)</num><content> the public may be adequately reminded about any health hazards that may be associated with the consumption or abuse of alcoholic beverages through a nationally uniform, nonconfusing warning notice on each container of such beverages; and</content>
