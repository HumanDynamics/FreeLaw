<note style="-uslm-lc:I74" topic="historicalAndRevision" id="idd5d3d6fd-5567-11e4-9868-843ba50653ee"><heading class="centered smallCaps">Historical and Revision Notes</heading><p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Based on acts <ref href="/us/act/1899-03-03/ch419/s31">Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419, § 31</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/30/1021">30 Stat. 1021</ref>; <ref href="/us/act/1902-03-06/ch139/s6">Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139, § 6</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/32/52">32 Stat. 52</ref>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section is new to the United States Code, but is in accordance with current practice. <ref href="/us/act/1899-03-03/ch419">Act Mar. 3, 1899, ch. 419</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/30/1014">30 Stat. 1014</ref>, which established the “Census Office” on a temporary basis, provided in section 31 thereof (<ref href="/us/stat/30/1021">30 Stat. 1021</ref>) for a seal for that office. The office was made permanent by <ref href="/us/act/1902-03-06/ch139">act Mar. 6, 1902, ch. 139</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/32/51">32 Stat. 51</ref>, and section 6 of that act (<ref href="/us/stat/32/52">32 Stat. 52</ref>) continued in full force and effect “for the taking of the Thirteenth and subsequent censuses” all provisions of the act of <date date="1899-03-03">Mar. 3, 1899</date>, not inconsistent with the provisions of such 1902 act. Therefore, since the 1902 act contained no provisions with respect to a seal, section 31 of the 1899 act, providing for the seal, remained in force as it was not inconsistent. Section 33 of <ref href="/us/act/1909-07-02/ch2">act July 2, 1909, ch. 2</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/36/10">36 Stat. 10</ref>, which act (<ref href="/us/stat/36/1">36 Stat. 1</ref>) related to the Thirteenth and subsequent decennial censuses, repealed the said act of <date date="1899-03-03">Mar. 3, 1899</date>, specifically, and all “other” laws and parts of laws inconsistent with the provisions of the 1909 act. These repealing provisions are somewhat ambiguous, but it was probably the intent of Congress, as it was the intent thereof at the time of enactment of the act of <date date="1902-03-06">Mar. 6, 1902</date>, referred to above, to continue in effect all provisions of the act of <date date="1899-03-03">Mar. 3, 1899</date>, that were not inconsistent with the act of <date date="1909-07-02">July 2, 1909</date>. The 1909 act contained no provisions with respect to the seal, and it accordingly follows that the provisions of <ref href="/us/act/1899-03-03/s31">section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899</ref>, with respect thereto, continued in force. This is also the interpretation of the Bureau of the Census, which has continued to use a seal through the years in connection with “certificates and attestations”.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In any event, this new section merely confirms past and present practice, and restores, if it does not preserve, statutory authority for possession and use of the seal which is a very necessary part of the operations of the Bureau. Further, the section should serve to forestall future differences of interpretation. In the past, some States have refused to recognize the seal of the Census Bureau on the ground that it was not authorized by law. In all probability, this position was taken, not as the result of a search of the Statutes at Large, which would have been a difficult project, but because provisions relating to the seal were not set out in the United States Code where they would have been readily accessible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The language of this section follows substantially the language of <ref href="/us/act/1899-03-03/s31">section 31 of the act of Mar. 3, 1899</ref>, referred to above, but has been reworded because of jurisdictional and other changes since that time. The “Census Office” was transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Commerce and Labor by <ref href="/us/act/1903-02-14/ch552/s4">act Feb. 14, 1903, ch. 552, § 4</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/32/826">32 Stat. 826</ref>. <ref href="/us/act/1913-03-04/ch141/s1">Act Mar. 4, 1913, ch. 141, § 1</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/37/736">37 Stat. 736</ref>, changed the name of the latter to the Department of Commerce, and created, as a separate department, the Department of Labor. It transferred a number of bureaus and agencies from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Labor, but these transfers did not affect the Bureau of the Census, which has remained under the jurisdiction of the Department of Commerce. 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. <date date="1950-05-24">May 24, 1950</date>, 15 F.R. 3174, <ref href="/us/stat/64/1263">64 Stat. 1263</ref>, transferred all functions of all officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies of the Department of Commerce to the Secretary of Commerce, and vested power in him to delegate them or any of his other functions to any of such officers, employees, bureaus, and agencies. Therefore, in this section, “Secretary”, and “Secretary or such officer or employee of the Bureau as he designates”, were substituted, respectively, for two references to the Director of the Census, to conform with such Plan.</p>

Further, words “or to whatever other officer is designated by the Secretary to take the census provided for in sections 141 and 142 of this title” were inserted after “Director of the Census” in par.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The provisions of <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s111">section 111 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., authorizing statistics relating to transportation by water, and express business, to mines, mining, quarries, and minerals, to savings banks and other savings institutions, mortgage, loan, and investment companies, and similar institutions, and to street railways, electric light and power, telephone, and telegraph business, were omitted as superseded and covered by sections 121–123 of such title (enacted in 1948), which are set out elsewhere in this title. See Distribution Table.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><ref href="/us/usc/t13/s111">Section 111 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., also authorized the decennial collection of statistics relating to the fishing industry “in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service”. In the basic statutory provision (see amendment by <ref href="/us/act/1906-06-07/ch3048">act June 7, 1906, ch. 3048</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/34/218">34 Stat. 218</ref>, “Fish and Wildlife Service” read “Bureau of Fisheries” and it was changed, by the codifiers, in such section 111 to the former designation because of 1940 Reorganization Plan No. III, § 3, 5 F.R. 2107, <ref href="/us/stat/54/1232">54 Stat. 1232</ref>, which consolidated the Bureau of Fisheries and the Bureau of Biological Survey into one agency to be known as the “Fish and Wildlife Service”. However, at the time of the enactment of the 1906 act, referred to above, both the Bureau of the Fisheries, and the Census Bureau (then referred to as the “Census Office”), were in the Department of Commerce. The Bureau of Fisheries was transferred to the Department of the Interior by 1939 Reorganization Plan No. II, § 4(e), 4 F.R. 2731, <ref href="/us/stat/53/1431">53 Stat. 1431</ref>, and it is within that department that the Fish and Wildlife Service now functions. Therefore, such provision in <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s111">section 111 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., has been omitted from this revised title as obsolete. In any event <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s121">section 121 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title) is broad enough to authorize such collection.</p>

See Distribution Table.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proviso in <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s111">section 111 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which prohibited the collection of statistics relating to religious or church membership when the disclosure of such information was prohibited by religious or church doctrine, teaching or discipline, has been incorporated in chapter 7 of this title.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section consolidates parts of sections 74 and 84 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., relating to cotton statistics and statistics on oilseeds, nuts and kernels, fats, oils and greases (subchapters I and II of chapter 3 of this revised title), all of section 210 of such title, which section was a part of chapter 4 thereof relating to the decennial censuses of population, agriculture, etc. (subchapter II of chapter 5, of this revised title), with that part of section 122 of such title which made such section 210 applicable to the quinquennial censuses of manufactures, the mineral industries, and other businesses provided for in section 121(a) of such title (subchapter I of chapter 5 of this revised title), and, with certain qualifications and exceptions, applicable to the interim surveys provided for by section 121(b) of such title (subchapter IV of chapter 5 of this revised title), and that part of subsection (b) of <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s1442">section 1442 of title 42</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., which made such section 210 applicable to the decennial censuses of housing (subchapter II of chapter 5 of this revised title). For remainder of sections 74, 84 and 122 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and of <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s1442">section 1442 of title 42</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (which section has been transferred in its entirety to this revised title), see Distribution Table.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><ref href="/us/usc/t13/s210">Section 210 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., by its own terms was applicable to the collection of miscellaneous statistics provided for by section 111 of such title (subchapter III of chapter 3 of this revised title), except that such section 111 placed certain restrictions upon the collection of statistics on religion. These restrictions, along with those of section 122 of such title with respect to the making of surveys, and along with provisions excepting this section from application to the censuses of governments provided for by <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s251">section 251 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed. (subchapter III of chapter 5 of this revised title), are set out as another section in this revised title. Subject to those exceptions and restrictions, this section applies to all collections and censuses provided for in this title, in so far as it is relevant.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Sections 74, 84 and 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., described the same type of offenses, but the penal provisions varied. Section 74 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 and maximum imprisonment of one year, for refusal to answer or giving a false answer; section 84 prescribed maximum fine of $1,000 for refusal to answer or giving false answer, with no imprisonment; and section 210 prescribed maximum fine of $500 and maximum imprisonment of sixty days for refusal to answer, and maximum fine of $10,000 and maximum imprisonment of one year for giving a false answer. In addition, such section 74 prescribed a minimum fine of $300 for refusal to answer or giving a false answer. This revised section adopts the penalties of such section 210, which was the latest enactment on the subject, and which might have been regarded as having superseded the penal provisions of such sections 74 and 84. According to its own terms, its penal provisions were applicable not only to the censuses of population, agriculture, etc., provided for in chapter 4 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., but also to any schedules prepared under the act of <date date="1902-03-06">March 6, 1902</date> (sections 1–6, 77, 101, 111, and 112 of such title), or under acts amendatory thereof “or supplemental thereto.” This reference did not cover sections 74 and 84 specifically, but such sections, enacted in 1924 and 1916, respectively, could probably be regarded as having been “supplemental” to the 1902 act. In any event, this revised section establishes uniform penalties for refusal to answer, or giving a false answer in the circumstances stated. Further, the prescribed penalties are the maximum, and any lesser penalty can be imposed if the facts of the case warrant it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reference to the “Secretary [of Commerce] or other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof” was substituted for references to the Director of the Census and employees of the Bureau of the Census, to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. <date date="1950-05-24">May 24, 1950</date>, 15 F.R. 3174, <ref href="/us/stat/64/1263">64 Stat. 1263</ref>. See Revision Note to <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s4">section 4 of this title</ref>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">References to the offenses as being in each case a “misdemeanor” were omitted as covered by <ref href="/us/usc/t18/s1">section 1 of title 18</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., Crimes and Criminal Procedure, classifying crimes; and words “upon conviction thereof” and “at the discretion of the court” were omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The provision permitting the requests to be made by registered mail, by telegraph, by visiting representative, or by one or more of these methods, was contained in sections 74 and 84 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., but not in section 210 of such title. It is retained in this section as probably a desirable provision to apply generally.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Provisions in sections 74, 84 and 210 of title 13, U.S.C., 1952 ed., that it “shall be the duty” of the persons referred to, to answer correctly, etc., were omitted as unnecessary and redundant. This section defines offenses and prescribes penalties for committing them, and are deemed sufficient for the purpose of enforcement. However, some of the language used in the omitted provisions was necessarily included in the description of the offenses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Changes were made in phraseology.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subsections (a) and (b) of this revised section are from <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s122">section 122 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., and in subsection (a) references to the Secretary (of Commerce) and to “other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof” were substituted for references to the Director of the Census to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. <date date="1950-05-24">May 24, 1950</date>, 15 F.R. 3174, <ref href="/us/stat/64/1263">64 Stat. 1263</ref>.

However, it did not list sections 209 and 210 of such title among the sections made so applicable, probably because they would hardly be relevant and capable of application to such censuses. Subsection (c) makes it clear that sections 221–224 of this revised title, into which were carried the provisions of such sections 209 and 210, and which speak in general terms, are not applicable to the censuses and surveys of governments.</p>

It was felt that such exception in such section 111 was actually more in the nature of an exception to the penal provisions, and it has been so treated in this revised title.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><ref href="/us/usc/t13/s74">Section 74 of title 13</ref>, U.S.C., 1952 ed., authorized the making of requests for information by registered mail, and provided that, if so made, the registry receipt should be “accepted as evidence of such demand”. Section 84 thereof authorized the making of requests by registered mail, or “by telegraph”, and provided that, if so made, the “return” receipt therefor should be “prima facie evidence of an official request”. The authorizations contained in such sections have been carried into <ref href="/us/usc/t13/s224">section 224 of this title</ref>, and the evidentiary provisions thereof have been carried into this section, and they apply to investigations other than those to which such sections 74 and 84 related.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Further, words “Secretary or other authorized officer or employee of the Department of Commerce or bureau or agency thereof” were substituted for references to the Director of the Census, to conform with 1950 Reorganization Plan No. 5, §§ 1, 2, eff. <date date="1950-05-24">May 24, 1950</date>, 15 F.R. 3174, <ref href="/us/stat/64/1263">64 Stat. 1263</ref>.
