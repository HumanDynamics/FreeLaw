<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Section</inline> 1. <i>Policy</i>. It is the policy of the executive branch of the Government of the United States of America to help answer the questions that the people of Puerto Rico have asked for years regarding the options for the islands’ future status and the process for realizing an option. Further, it is our policy to consider and develop positions on proposals, without preference among the options, for the Commonwealth’s future status; to discuss such proposals with representatives of the people of Puerto Rico and the Congress; to work with leaders of the Commonwealth and the Congress to clarify the options to enable Puerto Ricans to determine their preference among options for the islands’ future status that are not incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws and policies of the United States; and to implement such an option if chosen by a majority, including helping Puerto Ricans obtain a governing arrangement under which they would vote for national government officials, if they choose such a status. It is also the policy of the executive branch to improve the treatment of Puerto Rico in Federal programs and to promote job creation, education, health care, clean energy, and economic development on the islands.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 2. <i>The President’s Task Force on Puerto Rico’s Status</i>. There is established a task force to be known as “The President’s Task Force on Puerto Rico’s Status” (Task Force).

The Task Force shall be co-chaired by the Attorney General’s designee and the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director for Intergovernmental Affairs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 3. <i>Functions</i>. The Task Force shall seek to implement the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. The Task Force shall ensure official attention to and facilitate action on matters related to proposals for Puerto Rico’s status and provide advice and recommendations on such matters to the President and the Congress. The Task Force shall also identify and promote existing Federal initiatives that benefit Puerto Rico; provide advice and recommendations to the President and the Congress on the treatment of Puerto Rico in Federal programs; and provide advice and recommendations to the President and the Congress on policies and initiatives that promote job creation, education, health care, clean energy, and economic development on the islands.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">Sec</inline>. 4. <i>Report</i>. The Task Force shall submit to the President a report on the actions it has taken to perform the functions set forth in section 3 no later than 1 year from the date of this order.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Puerto Rico is a self-governing territory of the United States whose residents have been United States citizens since 1917 and have fought valorously in five wars in the defense of our Nation and the liberty of others.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1952-07-25">July 25, 1952</date>, as a consequence of steps taken by both the United States Government and the people of Puerto Rico voting in a referendum, a new constitution was promulgated establishing the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The Commonwealth structure provides for self-government in respect of internal affairs and administration, subject to relevant portions of the Constitution and the laws of the United States. As long as Puerto Rico is a territory, however, the will of its people regarding their political status should be ascertained periodically by means of a general right of referendum or specific referenda sponsored either by the United States Government or the Legislature of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because Puerto Rico’s degree of constitutional self-government, population, and size set it apart from other areas also subject to Federal jurisdiction under Article IV, section 3, clause 2 of the Constitution, I hereby direct all Federal departments, agencies, and officials, to the extent consistent with the Constitution and the laws of the United States, henceforward to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a State, except insofar as doing so with respect to an existing Federal program or activity would increase or decrease Federal receipts or expenditures, or would seriously disrupt the operation of such program or activity. With respect to a Federal program or activity for which no fiscal baseline has been established, this memorandum shall not be construed to require that such program or activity be conducted in a way that increases or decreases Federal receipts or expenditures relative to the level that would obtain if Puerto Rico were treated other than as a State.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If any matters arise involving the fundamentals of Puerto Rico’s status, they shall be referred to the Office of the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This guidance shall remain in effect until Federal legislation is enacted altering the current status of Puerto Rico in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of Puerto Rico.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The memorandum for the heads of executive departments and agencies on this subject, issued <date date="1961-07-25">July 25, 1961</date> [26 F.R. 6695], is hereby rescinded.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The executive power of Guam shall be vested in an executive officer whose official title shall be the “Governor of Guam”. The Governor of Guam, together with the Lieutenant Governor, shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the people who are qualified to vote for the members of the Legislature of Guam. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be chosen jointly, by the casting by each voter of a single vote applicable to both offices. If no candidates receive a majority of the votes cast in any election, on the fourteenth day thereafter a runoff election shall be held between the candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor receiving the highest and second highest number of votes cast. The first election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be held on <date date="1970-11-03">November 3, 1970</date>. Thereafter, beginning with the year 1974, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be elected every four years at the general election. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall hold office for a term of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">No person who has been elected Governor for two full successive terms shall again be eligible to hold that office until one full term has intervened.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The term of the elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall commence on the first Monday of January following the date of election.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">No person shall be eligible for election to the office of Governor or Lieutenant Governor unless he is an eligible voter and has been for five consecutive years immediately preceding the election a citizen of the United States and a bona fide resident of Guam and will be, at the time of taking office, at least thirty years of age. The Governor shall maintain his official residence in Guam during his incumbency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The Governor shall have general supervision and control of all the departments, bureaus, agencies, and other instrumentalities of the executive branch of the government of Guam. He may grant pardons and reprieves and remit fines and forfeitures for offenses against local laws. He may veto any legislation as provided in this chapter. He shall appoint, and may remove, all officers and employees of the executive branch of the government of Guam, except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act of Congress, or under the laws of Guam, and shall commission all officers that he may be authorized to appoint. He shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws of Guam and the laws of the United States applicable in Guam. Whenever it becomes necessary, in case of disaster, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion, or imminent danger thereof, or to prevent or suppress lawless violence, he may summon the posse comitatus or call out the militia or request assistance of the senior military or naval commander of the Armed Forces of the United States in Guam, which may be given at the discretion of such commander if not disruptive of, or inconsistent with, his Federal responsibilities. He may, in case of rebellion or invasion, or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, proclaim the island, insofar as it is under the jurisdiction of the government of Guam, to be under martial law. The members of the legislature shall meet forthwith on their own initiative and may, by a two-thirds vote, revoke such proclamation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The Governor shall prepare, publish, and submit to the Congress and the Secretary of the Interior a comprehensive annual financial report in conformance with the standards of the National Council on Governmental Accounting within one hundred and twenty days after the close of the fiscal year. The comprehensive annual financial report shall include statistical data as set forth in the standards of the National Council on Governmental Accounting relating to the physical, economic, social, and political characteristics of the government, and any other information required by the Congress. The Governor shall also make such other reports at such other times as may be required by the Congress or under applicable Federal law. He shall have the power to issue executive orders and regulations not in conflict with any applicable law. He may recommend bills to the legislature and give expression to his views on any matter before that body.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">There is hereby established the office of Lieutenant Governor of Guam. The Lieutenant Governor shall have such executive powers and perform such duties as may be assigned to him by the Governor or prescribed by this chapter or under the laws of Guam.</p>

Bonds or other obligations of the government of Guam payable solely from revenues derived from any public improvement or undertaking shall not be considered public indebtedness of Guam within the meaning of this section.

The Secretary, upon determining that the Guam Power Authority is unable to refinance on reasonable terms the obligations purchased by the Federal Financing Bank under the fifth sentence of this section by <date date="1980-12-31">December 31, 1980</date>, may, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury, guarantee for purchase by the Federal Financing Bank; and such bank is authorized to purchase, obligations of the Guam Power Authority issued to refinance the principal amount of the obligations guaranteed under the fifth sentence of this section.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">Every bill passed by the legislature shall, before it becomes a law, be entered upon the journal and presented to the Governor. If he approves it, he shall sign it, but if not he shall, except as hereinafter provided, return it, with his objections, to the legislature within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him. If he does not return it within such period, it shall be a law in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the legislature by adjournment prevents its return, in which case it shall be a law if signed by the Governor within thirty days after it shall have been presented to him; otherwise it shall not be a law. When a bill is returned by the Governor to the legislature with his objections, the legislature shall enter his objections at large on its journal and, upon motion of a member of the legislature, proceed to reconsider the bill. If, after such reconsideration, two-thirds of all the members of the legislature pass the bill, it shall be a law. If any bill presented to the Governor contains several items of appropriation of money, he may object to one or more of such items, or any part or parts, portion or portions thereof, while approving the other items, parts, or portions of the bill. In such a case he shall append to the bill at the time of signing it, a statement of the items, or parts or portions thereof, to which he objects, and the items, or parts or portions thereof, so objected to shall not take effect. All laws enacted by the legislature shall be reported by the Governor to the head of the department or agency designated by the President under <ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1421a">section 1421a of this title</ref>. The Congress of the United States reserves the power and authority to annul the same.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The source of most sections of this chapter is the Revised Statutes enacted in 1873 and other early statutes. The Revised Statutes can no longer apply to contiguous territory because no such territory now exists. As to noncontiguous territory, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands each has its own organic act, providing a complete system of government, legislative, executive, and judicial. The Canal Zone has its own code of laws. The independence of the Philippine Islands was recognized by Proc. No. 2695, eff. <date date="1946-07-04">July 4, 1946</date>, set out as a note under <ref href="/us/usc/t22/s1394">section 1394 of Title 22</ref>, Foreign Relations and Intercourse. The other possessions, such as Samoa, are covered by special provisions set out elsewhere in this title.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(c) solicit information and advice concerning the Insular Areas, as the IGIA determines appropriate, from representatives of entities or other individuals in a manner that seeks their individual advice and does not involve collective judgment, or consensus advice or deliberation;</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof, or the status of that department or agency within the Federal Government; or</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The executive power of the Virgin Islands shall be vested in an executive officer whose official title shall be the “Governor of the Virgin Islands”. The Governor of the Virgin Islands, together with the Lieutenant Governor, shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the people who are qualified to vote for the members of the legislature of the Virgin Islands. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be chosen jointly, by the casting by each voter of a single vote applicable to both officers. If no candidates receive a majority of the votes cast in any election, on the fourteenth day thereafter a run-off election shall be held between the candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor receiving the highest and second highest number of votes cast. The first election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be held on <date date="1970-11-03">November 3, 1970</date>. Thereafter, beginning with the year 1974, the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be elected every four years at the general election. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall hold office for a term of four years and until their successors are elected and qualified. No person who has been elected Governor for two full successive terms shall be again eligible to hold that office until one full term has intervened. The term of the elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall commence on the first Monday of January following the date of election.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">No person shall be eligible for election to the office of Governor or Lieutenant Governor unless he is an eligible voter and has been for five consecutive years immediately preceding the election a citizen of the United States and a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands and will be, at the time of taking office, at least thirty years of age. The Governor shall maintain his official residence in the Government House on Saint Thomas during his incumbency, which house, together with land appurtenant thereto, is hereby transferred to the government of the Virgin Islands. While in Saint Croix the Governor may reside in Government House on Saint Croix, which house, together with land appurtenant thereto is also transferred to the government of the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The Governor shall have general supervision and control of all the departments, bureaus, agencies, and other instrumentalities of the executive branch of the government of the Virgin Islands. He may grant pardons and reprieves and remit fines and forfeitures for offenses against local laws. He may veto any legislation as provided in this chapter. He shall appoint, and may remove, all officers and employees of the executive branch of the government of the Virgin Islands, except as otherwise provided in this or any other Act of Congress, or under the laws of the Virgin Islands, and shall commission all officers that he may be authorized to appoint. He shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws of the Virgin Islands and the laws of the United States applicable in the Virgin Islands. Whenever it becomes necessary, in case of disaster, invasion, insurrection, or rebellion or imminent danger thereof, or to prevent or suppress lawless violence, he may summon the posse comitatus or call out the militia or request assistance of the senior military or naval commander of the Armed Forces of the United States in the Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico, which may be given at the discretion of such commander if not disruptive of, or inconsistent with, his Federal responsibilities. He may, in case of rebellion or invasion or imminent danger thereof, when the public safety requires it, proclaim the islands, insofar as they are under the jurisdiction of the government of the Virgin Islands, to be under martial law. The members of the legislature shall meet forthwith on their own initiative and may, by a two-thirds vote, revoke such proclamation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">The Governor shall prepare, publish, and submit to the Congress and the Secretary of the Interior a comprehensive annual financial report in conformance with the standards of the National Council on Governmental Accounting within one hundred and twenty days after the close of the fiscal year. The comprehensive annual financial report shall include statistical data as set forth in the standards of the National Council on Governmental Accounting relating to the physical, economic, social, and political characteristics of the government, and any other information required by the Congress. The Governor shall also make such other reports at such other times as may be required by the Congress or under applicable Federal law. He shall have the power to issue executive orders and regulations not in conflict with any applicable law. He may recommend bills to the legislature and give expression to his views on any matter before that body.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I11" class="indent0">There is hereby established the office of Lieutenant Governor of the Virgin Islands. The Lieutenant Governor shall have such executive powers and perform such duties as may be assigned to him by the Governor or prescribed by this chapter or under the laws of the Virgin Islands.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since <date date="1947-07-18">July 18, 1947</date>, the United States has administered the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (“Trust Territory”), which includes the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1975-02-15">February 15, 1975</date>, after extensive status negotiations, the United States and the Marianas Political Status Commission concluded a Covenant to establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States (“Covenant”) [set out above]. Sections 101, 1002, and 1003(c) of the Covenant provide that the Northern Mariana Islands will become a self-governing Commonwealth in political union with and under the sovereignty of the United States. This Covenant was approved by the Congress by <ref href="/us/pl/94/241">Public Law 94–241</ref> of <date date="1976-03-24">March 24, 1976</date>, <ref href="/us/stat/90/263">90 Stat. 263</ref> [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1801">48 U.S.C. 1801</ref> et seq.]. Although many sections of the Covenant became effective in 1976 and 1978, certain sections have not previously entered into force.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1982-10-01">October 1, 1982</date>, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia concluded a Compact of Free Association, establishing a relationship of Free Association between the two Governments [see Compact of Free Association, <ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1901">48 U.S.C. 1901</ref> note]. On <date date="1983-06-25">June 25, 1983</date>, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Marshall Islands concluded a Compact of Free Association, establishing a relationship of Free Association between the two Governments [see Compact of Free Association, <ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1901">48 U.S.C. 1901</ref> note]. Pursuant to Sections 111 and 121 of the Compacts, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands become self-governing and have the right to conduct foreign affairs in their own name and right upon the effective date of their respective Compacts. Each Compact comes into effect upon (1) mutual agreement between the Government of the United States, acting in fulfillment of its responsibilities as Administering Authority of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the other Government; (2) the approval of the Compact by the two Governments, in accordance with their constitutional processes; and (3) the conduct of a plebiscite in that jurisdiction. In the Federated States of Micronesia, the Compact has been approved by the Government in accordance with its constitutional processes, and in a United Nations-observed plebiscite on <date date="1983-06-21">June 21, 1983</date>, a sovereign act of self-determination. In the Marshall Islands, the Compact has been approved by the Government in accordance with its constitutional processes, and in a United Nations-observed plebiscite on <date date="1983-09-07">September 7, 1983</date>, a sovereign act of self-determination. In the United States the Compacts have been approved by <ref href="/us/pl/99/239">Public Law 99–239</ref> of <date date="1986-01-14">January 14, 1986</date>, <ref href="/us/stat/99/1770">99 Stat. 1770</ref> [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1901">48 U.S.C. 1901</ref> et seq., 2001 et seq.].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-01-10">January 10, 1986</date>, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Palau concluded a Compact of Free Association, establishing a similar relationship of Free Association between the two Governments [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1931">48 U.S.C. 1931</ref> note]. On <date date="1986-10-16">October 16, 1986</date>, the Congress of the United States approved the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of Palau. In the Republic of Palau, the Compact approval process has not yet been completed. Until the future political status of Palau is resolved, the United States will continue to discharge its responsibilities in Palau as Administering Authority under the Trusteeship Agreement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-05-28">May 28, 1986</date>, the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations concluded that the Government of the United States had satisfactorily discharged its obligations as the Administering Authority under the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement and that the people of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands had freely exercised their right to self-determination, and considered that it was appropriate for that Agreement to be terminated. The Council asked the United States to consult with the governments concerned to agree on a date for entry into force of their respective new status agreements.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-10-15">October 15, 1986</date>, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands agreed, pursuant to Section 411 of the Compact of Free Association, that as between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the effective date of the Compact shall be <date date="1986-10-21">October 21, 1986</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-10-24">October 24, 1986</date>, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia agreed, pursuant to Section 411 of the Compact of Free Association, that as between the United States and the Federated States of Micronesia, the effective date of the Compact shall be <date date="1986-11-03">November 3, 1986</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-10-24">October 24, 1986</date>, the United States advised the Secretary General of the United Nations that, as a consequence of consultations held between the United States Government and the Government of the Marshall Islands, agreement had been reached that the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands entered fully into force on <date date="1986-10-21">October 21, 1986</date>. The United States further advised the Secretary General that, as a result of consultations with their governments, agreement had been reached that the Compact of Free Association with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Covenant with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands would enter into force on <date date="1986-11-03">November 3, 1986</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As of this day, <date date="1986-11-03">November 3, 1986</date>, the United States has fulfilled its obligations under the Trusteeship Agreement with respect to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, and they are self-governing and no longer subject to the Trusteeship. In taking these actions, the United States is implementing the freely expressed wishes of the peoples of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including Section 1002 of the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, and Sections 101 and 102 of the Joint Resolution to approve the “Compact of Free Association”, and for other purposes, approved on <date date="1986-01-14">January 14, 1986</date> (<ref href="/us/pl/99/239">Public Law 99–239</ref>) [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1901">48 U.S.C. 1901</ref> et seq., 2001 et seq.], do hereby find, declare, and proclaim as follows:</p>

The Secretary of State shall include in the annual reports on the status of internationally recognized human rights in foreign countries, which are submitted to Congress pursuant to sections 2151n and 2304 of title 22, a full and complete report regarding the status of internationally recognized human rights in the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Proc. No. 6726, <date date="1994-09-27">Sept. 27, 1994</date>, 59 F.R. 49777, provided:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since <date date="1947-07-18">July 18, 1947</date>, the United States has administered the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (“Trust Territory”), which has included the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-11-03">November 3, 1986</date>, a Covenant between the United States and the Northern Mariana Islands [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1801">48 U.S.C. 1801</ref> note] came into force. This Covenant established the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands as a self-governing Commonwealth in political union with and under the sovereignty of the United States.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-10-21">October 21, 1986</date>, in the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and on <date date="1986-11-03">November 3, 1986</date>, in the case of the Federated States of Micronesia, Compacts of Free Association with the United States [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1901">48 U.S.C. 1901</ref> note] became effective. Under the Compacts, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands became self-governing sovereign states, in free association with the United States. Following the changes in political status of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, the Trusteeship Agreement ceased to be applicable to those entities and only Palau remained as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1986-01-10">January 10, 1986</date>, the Government of the United States and the Government of Palau concluded a Compact of Free Association [set out above] similar to those that the United States entered into with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and with the Federated States of Micronesia. As in those instances, it was specified that the Compact with Palau would come into effect upon (1) mutual agreement between the Government of the United States, acting in fulfillment of its responsibilities as Administering Authority of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Government of Palau; (2) the approval of the Compact by the two Governments, in accordance with their constitutional processes; and (3) the approval of the Compact by plebiscite in Palau.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In Palau the Compact has been approved by the Government in accordance with its constitutional processes and by a United Nations-observed plebiscite on <date date="1993-11-09">November 9, 1993</date>, a sovereign act of self-determination. In the United States the Compact was approved by <ref href="/us/pl/99/658">Public Law 99–658</ref> of <date date="1986-11-14">November 14, 1986</date> [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1931">48 U.S.C. 1931</ref> et seq.], and <ref href="/us/pl/101/219">Public Law 101–219</ref> of <date date="1989-12-12">December 12, 1989</date> [<ref href="/us/usc/t48/s1951">48 U.S.C. 1951</ref> et seq.].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1994-05-25">May 25, 1994</date>, the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations concluded that the Government of the United States had satisfactorily discharged its obligations as the Administering Authority under the terms of the Trusteeship Agreement and that the people of Palau had freely exercised their right to self-determination and considered that it was appropriate for the Trusteeship Agreement to be terminated. The Council asked the United States to consult with the Government of Palau and to agree on a date, on or about <date date="1994-10-01">October 1, 1994</date>, for entry into force of their new status agreement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1994-07-15">July 15, 1994</date>, the Government of the United States and the Government of the Republic of Palau agreed, pursuant to section 411 of the Compact of Free Association, that as between the United States and the Republic of Palau, the effective date of the Compact shall be <date date="1994-10-01">October 1, 1994</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As of this day, <date date="1994-09-27">September 27, 1994</date>, the United States has fulfilled its obligations under the Trusteeship Agreement with respect to the Republic of Palau. On <date date="1994-10-01">October 1, 1994</date>, the Compact will enter into force between the United States and the Republic of Palau, and Palau will thereafter be self-governing and no longer subject to the Trusteeship. In taking these actions, the United States is implementing the freely expressed wishes of the people of Palau.</p>
<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J.
