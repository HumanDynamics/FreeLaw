## Overview
A smart contract creation system for non-technical, non-lawyer users, backed
by Ethereum.

Contracts are built from smaller components or clauses. Clauses can contain
legal terms, Ethereum programs, or both, and come with human-readable short
descriptions.

Users simply drag-and-drop and fill in prompts to create their
contracts, and hit Go. Their contracts are automatically deployed onto
the Ethereum blockchain, no coding knowledge required.
