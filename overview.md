Projects
--------

    - enumerate
    - value (not always money)
    - cost (always money)
    - risk
    - XBRL & GAP (generally accepted accounting principles)
- Smart content BLOX
    - digital assets that evaluate themselves?
    - all-digital entity (people think I shouldn't?)
    - not smart contracts, smart contract blocks / documents
        - handles state changes, integrates with tools & workflow
    - "Computer bacteria"
    - Break down blockchains
    - Cloud Foundry
    - Automatic filing & accounting


Business Blocks
---------------
System for contracts & business process management.
Easy to use for non-technical users.
Makes legal agreements more understandable for non-legal users.
Handles both specification and actualization of business stuff.
As real-time as possible. "You click the button and something happens."
Obvious, clear, complete storage
    Structure / Data (JSON)
    Functionality (???) - Javascript package, appc container with REST API

Identity part:
    Combine identities:
        https://keybase.io/
        https://onename.com/
    Keep identities apart

More precise:
    Modular contract & business process system
    State transition networks for business processes

Evaluation / Validation


# Examples
Example clauses
- 

# Others in space
## Docracy
Mainly about single contracts
We need components / clauses

Problems:
- Hard to choose exact contract; contracts are idiosyncratic
- Get lots of branches that nobody can build on

## Blockapps
"Enterprise blockchains applications"

# Testing
Functional
Usability
