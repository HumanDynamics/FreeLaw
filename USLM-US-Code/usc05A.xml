<heading class="centered smallCaps">Lobbyists on Agency Boards and Commissions</heading>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Memorandum of President of the United States, <date date="2010-06-18">June 18, 2010</date>, 75 F.R. 35955, provided:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">My Administration is committed to reducing the undue influence of special interests that for too long has shaped the national agenda and drowned out the voices of ordinary Americans. Special interests exert this disproportionate influence, in part, by relying on lobbyists who have special access that is not available to all citizens. Although lobbyists can sometimes play a constructive role by communicating information to the government, their service in privileged positions within the executive branch can perpetuate the culture of special-interest access that I am committed to changing.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On the day after my inauguration, I signed Executive Order 13490, which places strict limits on the ability of lobbyists to serve in Government positions related to their prior lobbying activities. Last September, we took another step to close the revolving door through which lobbyists enter and exit Government positions when we announced that my Administration aspires to keep Federal agencies’ advisory boards free of federally registered lobbyists. Many departments and agencies are making this aspiration a reality by no longer placing federally registered lobbyists on advisory boards—a practice that I am now establishing as the official policy of my Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly, I hereby direct the heads of executive departments and agencies not to make any new appointments or reappointments of federally registered lobbyists to advisory committees and other boards and commissions. Within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue proposed guidance designed to implement this policy to the full extent permitted by law. The final guidance shall be issued following public comment on the proposed guidance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1939 (Public, No. 19, 76th Cong., 1st sess.), approved <date date="1939-04-03">April 3, 1939</date>, I herewith transmit Reorganization Plan No. I, which, after investigation, I have prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the act; and I declare that with respect to each transfer, consolidation, or abolition made in Reorganization Plan No. I, I have found that such transfer, consolidation, or abolition is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes of section 1(a) of the act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In these days of ruthless attempts to destroy democratic government, it is boldly asserted that democracies must always be weak in order to be democratic at all; and that, therefore, it will be easy to crush all free states out of existence.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Confident in our Republic’s 150 years of successful resistance to all subversive attempts upon it, whether from without or within, nevertheless we must be constantly alert to the importance of keeping the tools of American democracy up to date. It is our responsibility to make sure that the people’s government is in condition to carry out the people’s will, promptly, effectively, without waste or lost motion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In 1883 under President Arthur we strengthened the machinery of democracy by the Civil Service law; beginning in 1905 President Roosevelt initiated important inquiries into Federal administration; in 1911 President Taft named the Economy and Efficiency Commission which made very important recommendations; in 1921 under Presidents Wilson and Harding we tightened up our budgetary procedure. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Taft, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover in succession strongly recommended the rearrangement of Federal administrative activities. In 1937 I proposed, on the basis of an inquiry authorized and appropriated for by the Congress, the strengthening of the administrative management of the executive establishment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">None of all this long series of suggestions, running over more than a quarter of a century, was in any sense personal or partisan in design.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These measures have all had only one supreme purpose—to make democracy work—to strengthen the arms of democracy in peace or war and to ensure the solid blessings of free government to our people in increasing measure.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We are not free if our administration is weak. But we are free if we know, and others know, that we are strong; that we can be tough as well as tender hearted; and that what the American people decide to do can and will be done, capably and effectively, with the best national equipment that modern organizing ability can supply in a country where management and organization is so well understood in private affairs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">My whole purpose in submitting this plan is to improve the administrative management of the Republic, and I feel confident that our Nation is united in this central purpose, regardless of differences upon details.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan is concerned with the practical necessity of reducing the number of agencies which report directly to the President and also of giving the President assistance in dealing with the entire executive branch by modern means of administrative management.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Forty years ago in 1899 President McKinley could deal with the whole machinery of the executive branch through his 8 cabinet secretaries and the heads of 2 commissions; and there was but 1 commission of the so-called quasi-judicial type in existence. He could keep in touch with all the work through 8 or 10 persons.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Now, 40 years later, not only do some 30 major agencies (to say nothing of the minor ones) report directly to the President, but there are several quasi-judicial bodies which have enough administrative work to require them also to see him on important executive matters.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It has become physically impossible for one man to see so many persons, to receive reports directly from them, and to attempt to advise them on their own problems which they submit. In addition the President today has the task of trying to keep their programs in step with each other or in line with the national policy laid down by the Congress. And he must seek to prevent unnecessary duplication of effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The administrative assistants provided for the President in the Reorganization Act cannot perform these functions of over-all management and direction. Their task will be to help me get information, and condense and summarize it—they are not to become in any sense Assistant Presidents nor are they to have any authority over anybody in any department or agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The only way in which the President can be relieved of the physically impossible task of directly dealing with 30 or 40 major agencies is by reorganization—by the regrouping of agencies according to their major purposes under responsible heads who will report to the President, just as is contemplated by the Reorganization Act of 1939.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This act says that the President shall investigate the organization of all agencies of the Government and determine what changes are necessary to accomplish any one or more of five definite purposes:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(1) To reduce expenditures;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(2) To increase efficiency;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(3) To consolidate agencies according to major purposes;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(4) To reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions and by abolishing such as may not be necessary;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(5) To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It being obviously impracticable to complete this task at one time, but having due regard to the declaration of Congress that it should be accomplished immediately and speedily, I have decided to undertake it promptly in several steps.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The first step is to improve over-all management, that is, to do those things which will accomplish the purposes set out in the law, and which, at the same time, will reduce the difficulties of the President in dealing with the multifarious agencies of the executive branch and assist him in distributing his responsibilities as the chief administrator of the Government by providing him with the necessary organization and machinery for better administrative management.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The second step is to improve the allocation of departmental activities, that is, to do those things which will accomplish the purposes set out in the law and at the same time help that part of the work of the executive branch which is carried on through executive departments and agencies. In all this the responsibility to the people is through the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The third step is to improve intradepartmental management, that is, to do those things which will enable the heads of departments and agencies the better to carry out their own duties and distribute their own work among their several assistants and subordinates.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each of these three steps may require from time to time the submission of one or more plans involving one or more reorganizations, but it is my purpose to fulfill the duty imposed upon me by the Congress as expeditiously as practicable and to the fullest extent possible in view of the exceptions and exemptions set out in the act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan I now transmit is divided into four parts or sections which I shall describe briefly as follows:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">PART 1. EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my message to the Congress of <date date="1937-01-12">January 12, 1937</date>, in discussing the problem of how to improve the administrative management of the executive branch, I transmitted with my approval certain recommendations for strengthening and developing the management arms of the President. Those three management arms deal with (1) budget, and efficiency research, (2) planning, and (3) personnel. My accumulated experience during the 2 years since that time has deepened my conviction that it is necessary for the President to have direct access to these managerial agencies in order that he may have the machinery to enable him to carry out his constitutional responsibility, and in order that he may be able to control expenditures, to increase efficiency, to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort, and to be able to get the information which will permit him the better to advise the Congress concerning the state of the Union and the program of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Therefore, I find it necessary and desirable in carrying out the purposes of the act to transfer the Bureau of the Budget to the Executive Office of the President from the Treasury Department. It is apparent from the legislative history of the Budget and Accounting Act that it was the purpose in 1921 to set up an Executive Budget for which the President would be primarily responsible to the Congress and to the people, and that the Director of the Budget was to act under the immediate direction and supervision of the President. While no serious difficulties have been encountered because of the fact that the Bureau of the Budget was placed in the Treasury Department so far as making budgetary estimates has been concerned, it is apparent that its coordinating activities and its research and investigational activities recently provided for by the Congress, will be facilitated if the Bureau is not a part of 1 of the 10 executive departments. Also, in order that the Bureau of the Budget may the better carry out its work of coordination and investigation, I find it desirable and necessary in order to accomplish the purposes of the act to transfer to the Bureau of the Budget the functions of the Central Statistical Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By these transfers to the Executive Office, the President will be given immediate access to that managerial agency which is concerned with the preparation and administration of the Budget, with the coordination of the work of the governmental agencies, and with research and investigation necessary to accomplish the five definite purposes of the Reorganization Act of 1939.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I also find it necessary and desirable to transfer to the Executive Office of the President the National Resources Committee, now an independent establishment, and to consolidate with it by transfer from the Department of Commerce the functions of the Federal Employment Stabilization Office, the consolidated unit to be known as the National Resources Planning Board. This Board would be made up as is the present Advisory Board of the National Resources Committee of citizens giving part-time services to the Government, who aided by their technical staff would be able to advise the President, the Congress, and the people with respect to plans and programs for the conservation of the national resources, physical and human. By these transfers to the Executive Office, the President will be given more direct access to and immediate direction over that agency which is concerned with planning for the utilization and conservation of the national resources, an indispensable part of the equipment of the Chief Executive.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On previous occasions I have recommended and I hereby renew and emphasize my recommendation that the work of this Board be placed upon a permanent statutory basis.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because of an exemption in the act, it is impossible to transfer to the Executive Office the administration of the third managerial function of the Government, that of personnel. However, I desire to inform the Congress that it is my purpose to name one of the administrative assistants to the President, authorized in the Reorganization Act of 1939, to serve as a liaison agent of the White House on personnel management.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In this manner, the President will be given for the first time direct access to the three principal necessary management agencies of the Government. None of the three belongs in any existing department. With their assistance, and with this reorganization, it will be possible for the President to continue the task of making investigations of the organization of the Government in order to control expenditures, increase efficiency, and eliminate overlapping.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">PART 2. FEDERAL SECURITY AGENCY</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Studies heretofore made by me and researches made at my direction, as well as recommendations submitted by me to the Congress, and especially those contained in my message of <date date="1937-01-12">January 12, 1937</date>, indicate clearly that to carry out the purposes of the Reorganization Act of 1939 to group, coordinate, and consolidate agencies of the Government according to major purposes and to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, would require the provision of 3 general agencies in addition to the 10 executive departments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is my objective, then, by transfer, consolidation, and abolition to set up a Federal Security Agency, a Federal Works Agency, and a Federal Loan Agency, and then to distribute among the 10 executive departments and these 3 new agencies, the major independent establishments in the Government (excepting those exempt from the operations of the act) in order to minimize overlapping and duplication, to increase efficiency and to reduce expenditures to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient operation of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I find it necessary and desirable to group in a Federal Security Agency those agencies of the Government, the major purposes of which are to promote social and economic security, educational opportunity, and the health of the citizens of the Nation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The agencies to be grouped are the Social Security Board, now an independent establishment, the United States Employment Service, now in the Department of Labor, the Office of Education, now in the Department of the Interior, the Public Health Service, now in the Treasury Department, the National Youth Administration, now in the Works Progress Administration, and the Civilian Conservation Corps, now an independent agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Social Security Board is placed under the Federal Security Agency, and at the same time the United States Employment Service is transferred from the Department of Labor and consolidated with the unemployment compensation functions of the Social Security Board in order that their similar and related functions of social and economic security may be placed under a single head and their internal operations simplified and integrated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The unemployment compensation functions of the Social Security Board and the employment service of the Department of Labor are concerned with the same problem, that of the employment, or the unemployment, of the individual worker.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Therefore, they deal necessarily with the same individual. These particular services to the particular individual also are bound up with the public-assistance activities of the Social Security Board. Not only will these similar functions be more efficiently and economically administered at the Federal level by such grouping and consolidation, but this transfer and merger also will be to the advantage of the administration of State social security programs and result in considerable saving of money in the administrative costs of the governments of the 48 States as well as those of the United States. In addition to this saving of money there will be a considerable saving of time and energy not only on the part of administrative officials concerned with this program in both Federal and State Governments, but also on the part of employers and workers, permitting through the simplification of procedures a reduction in the number of reports required and the elimination of unnecessary duplication in contacts with workers and with employers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because of the relationship of the educational opportunities of the country to the security of its individual citizens, the Office of Education with all of its functions, including, of course, its administration of Federal-State programs of vocational education, is transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Federal Security Agency. This transfer does not increase or extend the activities of the Federal Government in respect to education, but does move the existing activities into a grouping where the work may be carried on more efficiently and expeditiously, and where coordination and the elimination of overlapping may be better accomplished. The Office of Education has no relationship to the other functions of the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Public Health Service is transferred from the Treasury Department to the Federal Security Agency. It is obvious that the health activities of the Federal Government may be better carried out when so grouped than if they are left in the Treasury, which is primarily a fiscal agency, and where the necessary relationships with other social security, employment, and educational activities now must be carried on by an elaborate scheme of interdepartmental committee work.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Youth Administration is transferred from the Works Progress Administration to the Federal Security Agency since its major purpose is to extend the educational opportunities of the youth of the country and to bring them through the processes of training into the possession of skills which enable them to find employment. Other divisions of the Federal Security Agency will have the task of finding jobs, providing for unemployment compensation, and other phases of social security, while still other units of the new agency will be concerned with the problem of primary and secondary education, as well as vocational education and job training and retraining for employment. While much of the work of the National Youth Administration has been carried on through work projects, these have been merely the process through which its major purpose was accomplished, and, therefore, this agency under the terms of the act should be grouped with the other security agencies rather than with the work agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">For similar reasons the Civilian Conservation Corps, now an independent establishment, is placed under the Federal Security Agency because of the fact that its major purpose is to promote the welfare and further the training of the individuals who make up the corps, important as may be the construction work which they have carried on so successfully. The Civilian Conservation Corps is a small coordinating agency which supervises work carried on with the cooperation of several regular departments and independent units of the Government. This transfer would not interfere with the plan of work heretofore carried on but it would enable the Civilian Conservation Corps to coordinate its policies, as well as its operations, with those other agencies of the Government concerned with the educational and health activities and with human security.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">PART 3. FEDERAL WORKS AGENCY</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to carry out the purpose of the Reorganization Act of 1939 I find it necessary and desirable to group and consolidate under a Federal Works Agency those agencies of the Federal Government dealing with public works not incidental to the normal work of other departments, and which administer Federal grants or loans to State and local governments or other agencies for the purposes of construction.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The agencies so to be grouped are: The Bureau of Public Roads, now in the Department of Agriculture; the Public Buildings Branch of the Procurement Division, now in the Treasury Department; and the Branch of Building Management of the National Park Service (so far as it is concerned with public buildings which it operates for other departments or agencies) now in the Department of the Interior; the United States Housing Authority, now in the Department of the Interior; the Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works (familiarly known as P. W. A.); and the Works Progress Administration (familiarly known as W. P. A.) except the functions of the National Youth Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer of both the Public Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration to the new Federal Works Agency would provide for both principal types of public works that have been carried on by the Federal Government directly or in cooperation with the State and local governments. I find that it will be possible to reduce administrative costs as well as to improve efficiency and to eliminate overlapping by bringing these different programs of public works under a common head. But, because of the differences that justified their separate operation in the past and differences that will continue in the future to distinguish certain phases of major public works from work relief, I find it necessary to maintain them at least for the present as separate subordinate units of the Federal Works Agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present Federal Emergency Administration of Public Works is placed under the Federal Works Agency under the shorter name of Public Works Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The name of the Works Progress Administration has been changed to Works Projects Administration in order to make its title more descriptive of its major purpose.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Bureau of Public Roads is transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the Federal Works Agency and as a separate unit under the name of Public Roads Administration. This will bring the administration of the Federal roads program with its grants-in-aid to the States into coordination with other major public-works programs and other programs of grants and loans to the States.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The construction and operation of many public buildings is now carried on in two agencies which are consolidated under the new Federal Works Agency, namely the Public Buildings Branch of the Procurement Division of the Treasury Department (which is concerned with the construction of Federal buildings and with the operation of many public buildings outside the District of Columbia) and the Branch of Building Management of the National Park Service, of the Department of the Interior, which is concerned with the operation of public buildings in the District of Columbia. These two separate activities are consolidated in one unit to be known as the Public Buildings Administration. Improved efficiency, coordination of effort, and savings will result from this transfer and consolidation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Then, also, there is transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Federal Works Agency the United States Housing Authority. The major purpose of the United States Housing Authority is to administer grants-in-aid and loans to local public housing authorities in accordance with its established standards of construction in that part of the housing field which cannot be reached economically by private enterprise. For these reasons, it should be grouped with those other agencies which have to do with public works, with grants and loans to State and local governments and with construction practices and standards.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">PART 4. FEDERAL LOAN AGENCY AND TRANSFERS OF INDEPENDENT LENDING AGENCIES</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to carry out the purposes of the Reorganization Act of 1939 I find it necessary and desirable to group under a Federal Loan Agency those independent lending agencies of the Government which have been established from time to time for the purpose of stimulating and stabilizing the financial, commercial, and industrial enterprises of the Nation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The agencies to be grouped in the Federal Loan Agency are: The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the Electric Home and Farm Authority, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Housing Administration, and their associated agencies and boards, as well as the Export-Import Bank of Washington.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since 1916 the Congress has established from time to time agencies for providing loans, directly or indirectly, for the stimulation and stabilization of agriculture, and such agencies should in my opinion be grouped with the other agricultural activities of the Government. For that reason I find it necessary and desirable to accomplish the purposes of the act to transfer the Farm Credit Administration, the Federal Farm Mortgage Corporation, and the Commodity Credit Corporation and associated agencies to the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Economy and Efficiency</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One of the five purposes of the Reorganization Act of 1939 is “to reduce expenditures to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient operation of the Government.” This purpose is important in each phase of the plan here presented. The Reorganization Act prohibits abolishing functions—in other words basic services or activities performed. Therefore the reduction in expenditures to be effected must necessarily be brought about chiefly in the overhead administrative expenses of the agencies set up to perform certain functions. The chance for economy arises therefore not from stopping work, but from organizing the work and the overhead more efficiently in combination with other similar activities. Only the Congress can abolish or curtail functions now provided by law.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The overhead administrative costs of all the agencies affected in Reorganization Plan No. I is about $235,000,000. This does not include the loans they make, the benefits they pay, the wages of the unemployed who have been given jobs; it does not include the loans and grants to States or, in short, the functional expense. It does include the overhead expense of operating and administering all these agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reduction of administrative expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations specified in the plan is estimated as nearly as may be at between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 annually, a substantial lowering of the existing overhead. Certain of these economies can be brought about almost immediately, others will require a painstaking and gradual readjustment in the machinery and business practices of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Any such estimate is incomplete, however, without reference to the corresponding savings which will follow in the States and cities through the recommended consolidation of the Federal services with which they cooperate, and the improved efficiency and convenience which will be felt by citizens all over the Nation—many of whom will be able to find in a single office many of the services now scattered in several places. These economies will undoubtedly exceed the direct savings in the Federal Budget.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It will not be necessary to ask the Congress for any additional appropriations for the administrative expenses of the three consolidated agencies set up in this plan, since their costs will be met from funds now available for the administrative expenses of their component units. Actually new expenses will be only a fractional part of the expected savings.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Neither on this Reorganization Plan No. I nor on future reorganization plans, covering interdepartmental changes and intradepartmental changes, will every person agree on each and every detail. It is true that out of the many groupings and regroupings proposed in this message a few of the individual agencies could conceivably be placed elsewhere.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Nevertheless, I have been seeking to consider the functional origin and purpose of each agency as required by the reorganization bill itself.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If in the future experience shows that one or two of them should be regrouped, it will be wholly possible for the President and the Congress to make the change.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan presented herewith represents 2 years of study. It is a simple and easily understood plan. It conforms to methods of executive administration used by large private enterprises which are engaged in many lines of production. Finally, it will save a sum of money large in comparison with the existing overhead of the agencies involved.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I trust, therefore, that the Congress will view the plan as a whole and make it possible to take the first step in improving the executive administration of the Government of the United States.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1939 (Public, No. 19, 76th Cong., 1st Sess.) approved <date date="1939-04-03">April 3, 1939</date>, I herewith transmit Reorganization Plan No. II, which, after investigation, I have prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the act; and I declare that with respect to each transfer, consolidation, or abolition made in Reorganization Plan No. II, I have found that such transfer, consolidation, or abolition is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes of section 1 (a) of the act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my message to the Congress on <date date="1939-04-25">April 25, 1939</date>, transmitting Reorganization Plan No. I, I took occasion to say that, it being obviously impracticable to complete the task of reorganization at one time, I had decided, in view of the declaration of the Congress that it should be accomplished immediately and speedily, to undertake it in several steps.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Plan No. I, had to do with overall management. Plan No. II, transmitted herewith, is designed to improve the work of the executive branch for which, although carried on through executive departments and agencies, the responsibility to the people is through the President. It is concerned with the sole purpose of improving the administrative management of the executive branch by a more logical grouping of existing units and functions and by a further reduction in the number of independent agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. II as the result of studies that have been made for me and of my own experience over a period of several years, as the best way in which to regroup the agencies affected so as to fulfill the purposes of the act:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">1. To reduce expenditures;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">2. To increase efficiency;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">3. To consolidate agencies according to major purposes;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">4. To reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions and by abolishing such as may not be necessary; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">5. To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan I now transmit I shall describe briefly as follows:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I proposed to transfer the Foreign Commerce Service of the United States and its functions now in the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce of the Department of Commerce and the Foreign Agricultural Service of the United States and its functions in the Department of Agriculture to the Department of State, and to consolidate them with the Foreign Service of the United States under the direction and supervision of the Secretary of State.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By this transfer and consolidation, there will be a single Foreign Service in the Department of State, but this does not mean that the interests of the commercial and agricultural communities are to be neglected, for it is a part of the Plan that representatives of the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Commerce shall be placed on the Board of Foreign Service Personnel and that specific investigations relating to commerce and agriculture shall be initiated directly by the Secretaries of these two Departments who will receive directly the results of investigations in their own fields.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A much greater degree of coordination and effectiveness in our foreign establishments can be achieved under the plan than has ever before been possible. The needs of the different Departments and Agencies of the Government will be met more efficiently and the responsiveness of the foreign establishments to these needs will be greatly improved.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan presupposes that it may be necessary from time to time for various Departments and Agencies of the Government to send abroad specialists and technicians for relatively temporary duty. While these will not be in the Foreign Service, strictly speaking, they will be given a suitable commission by the Department of State, on a temporary basis, so that they may have the same obligations as other officers of the Foreign Service while on duty abroad.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also presupposes a special training period within the Department of Commerce and the Department of Agriculture for Foreign Service officers selected to specialize in commercial or agricultural work and contemplates the fullest utilization of the experience gained abroad by Foreign Service officers in the work of the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture in this country. There will be stationed in the Department of State a liaison officer of the Department of Commerce and of the Department of Agriculture to make effective the proposed cooperation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan specifically leaves undisturbed the relationships of the Department of Commerce and of the Department of Agriculture with the commercial and agricultural communities. What it does do is to consolidate the foreign services into one Foreign Service in the Department of State, where it ought to be, with the resulting advantages of economy, efficiency, better functional grouping, elimination of overlapping and duplication of effort, and greater service to our commercial and agricultural interests.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There is also transferred to the Department of State the Foreign Service Buildings Commission and its functions. This Commission is advisory to the administrative work of the Department of State and should no longer have the status of an independent establishment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Bureau of Lighthouses now in the Department of Commerce is transferred to the Treasury Department and consolidated with the Coast Guard in that Department. The advantages of this consolidation are obvious and fall clearly within the provision of the act requiring me to consolidate agencies according to major purposes. This will save money on equipment and administration and will permit the better use of personnel.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also includes the abolition of the Office of the Director General of Railroads and of the War Finance Corporation and the transfer of their functions to the Secretary of the Treasury to be wound up by him as rapidly as may be. In the case of the War Finance Corporation, it is directed that the final dissolution shall be accomplished not later than <date date="1939-12-31">December 31, 1939</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I further propose to transfer to the Department of Justice the Federal Prison Industries, Inc., and the National Training School for Boys, and at the same time to abolish the board of trustees of the National Training School for Boys. Responsibility for the Federal penal and correctional institutions is in the Department of Justice and these two independent establishments should be consolidated therein. None of the other Federal penal or correctional institutions has a board of trustees and there is no need of further continuing the board of the National Training School.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also provides for the abolition of the Codification Board established for the purpose of codifying existing administrative law and the transfer of its functions to the Division of the Federal Register in the National Archives. The work of this board has now progressed to the point where a separate board is no longer necessary and the future work of keeping the codification up to date can more efficiently and economically be carried on by the editorial staff of the Federal Register.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I find it necessary and desirable in order to accomplish the purposes of the Reorganization Act to abolish the National Bituminous Coal Commission and to transfer its functions to the Secretary of the Interior. Thus the task of conserving the bituminous-coal resources of the country may be carried on directly by the head of the Department principally responsible for the conservation of fuel and other mineral supplies. The Congress placed this Commission in the Department of the Interior, but experience has shown that direct administration will be cheaper, better, and more effective than through the cumbersome medium of an unnecessary commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer to the Department of the Interior of the Bureau of Insular Affairs in the War Department and its consolidation with the Division of Territories and Island Possessions in Interior is a functional transfer of obvious desirability. Under the provisions of existing law, however, I shall direct, where necessary, that certain correspondence from the Governor General of the Philippines shall be transmitted to the President through the Department of State.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan provides for the transfer to the Department of the Interior of the Bureau of Fisheries from the Department of Commerce and of the Bureau of Biological Survey from the Department of Agriculture. These two Bureaus have to do with conservation and utilization of the wildlife resources of the country, terrestrial and aquatic. Therefore, they should be grouped under the same departmental administration, and in that Department which, more than any other, is directly responsible for the administration and conservation of the public domain. However, I intend to direct that the facilities of the Department of Agriculture shall continue to be used for research studies which have to do with the protection of domestic animals from diseases of wildlife; and also where most economical for the protection to farmers and stockmen against predatory animals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also provides for the transfer of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission to the National Park Service in the Department of the Interior in order that this great memorial may be administered as a part of the similar work of the Park Service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Included in the plan is a provision to transfer to the Department of Agriculture the Rural Electrification Administration, now operated as an independent establishment. The work of this administration in its educational as well as its lending functions is clearly a part of the rural life activities of the country and should, therefore, be administered in coordination with the other agricultural activities of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Inland Waterways Corporation is transferred to the Department of Commerce from the War Department. This corporation, which operates inland waterways transportation facilities, should be coordinated with the administration of other aids to commerce and industry.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to transfer to the Federal Security Agency, for administration in the Office of Education, the film and radio functions of the National Emergency Council. These are clearly a part of the educational activities of the Government and should be consolidated with similar activities already carried on in the Office of Education. Similarly, Government participation in the work of the American Printing House for the Blind, except fiscal functions relating to trust funds, is transferred from the Secretary of the Treasury to the Federal Security Agency, in order that this work may be coordinated with the other work for the blind now being carried on in the Social Security Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan provides for the abolition of the National Emergency Council and the transfer to the Executive Office of the President of all its functions with the exception of the film and radio activities which go to the Office of Education. Subject to appropriations by the Congress, these activities transferred to the White House would be administered in the manner best designed to give the President the information he requires from all parts of the country.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Emergency Council was established by Executive order in 1933 and is composed of the President, the Vice President, the Members of the Cabinet, and the heads of some 23 independent establishments. Its usefulness as an actual council, which met weekly under my chairmanship, was very great in the period of the emergency which then confronted the country, but, as time has gone on, it no longer operates as a council but does continue to carry on important activities which are indispensable to the President of the United States, as well as to other branches of the Government, and the public. It maintains an information service and a press intelligence service, it publishes the United States Government Manual, and it carries on through State and central staffs an important work of coordinating and reporting.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The information service makes available general information concerning all phases of governmental activity and is provided for all who submit questions or inquiries by mail, by telephone, or by personal call. In one sense it may be called a post-office address—“Uncle Sam, Post Office Box No. 1, Washington, D.C.”—to which persons who want information about the Government but do not know the exact division or agency of the Government to which to apply, may write with confidence that their questions will be answered or else sent on to the proper agency for direct reply.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The press intelligence service carried on in the Council is not a service for giving intelligence to the press, but rather for making available to responsible persons in the Government, both in the executive and in the legislative branches, a clipping service, which shows what the press of the country has printed. The partial consolidation of clipping services in this unit—a consolidation which should go further—already has resulted in economy and convenience. A clipping service of this kind, on a smaller scale, was maintained for many years in the White House but it was not then available to other branches of the Government. Its return to the White House with the additional feature of availability to all the rest of the Government will promote efficiency without violating tradition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The publication of the United States Government Manual makes available to every citizen a simplified textbook of information as to the organization and availability of the Federal agencies. Published in loose-leaf form, it is sold by the Superintendent of Documents of the Government Printing Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The coordinating and reporting functions of the Council have to do with the presentation to the President of factual information, independently gathered, as to the progress and effect of our governmental activities. Through its State offices the Council has been able to facilitate the various Federal programs particularly with respect to State and local governments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also includes certain general provisions in order to accomplish fully the purposes of the act. In addition to the transfer of bureaus and other units, it is necessary also to transfer certain functions of heads of departments; to transfer records, property, and personnel; to transfer funds; and to provide that the power of appointment occasionally, and sometimes apparently quite accidentally, vested in a subordinate official of a department, shall be vested in the head of the department. It is impossible to exercise the proper direction and supervision over subordinate units unless the definite power of appointment, fixing of compensation, transfer, and promotion or dismissal of personnel is vested in the principal responsible head. In no other way can the purpose of consolidating similar functions under a single head as required by the act be accomplished in practice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is one of the five purposes of the Reorganization Act “to reduce expenditures to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient operation of the Government.” This is an important purpose in each phase of the plan here presented. The Reorganization Act prohibits abolishing functions—in other words, basic services or activities performed. Therefore, the reduction in expenditures must necessarily be brought about chiefly in the overhead administrative expenses of the agencies affected. In a great many cases the economies to be effected by Reorganization Plan No. II will be the result of improved efficiency which will, as the plan works out, require fewer persons to perform the work or will require the employment of less temporary assistance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the case of the consolidation of the foreign services it is estimated that the administration by a single administrative unit in the Department of State will achieve a saving of $20,000 a year and that consolidation of the three field forces will make it possible to drop alien employees and, by a more effective use of personnel, to save an additional $100,000 a year when the readjustments have been made.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The total administrative expense of all of the agencies affected by this plan is about $25,000,000 per annum.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reduction of such expenditures, which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations specified in the plan, is estimated at $1,250,000 per annum. Certain of these economies can be brought about at once. Others will require a gradual readjustment in machinery and business practices of the agencies affected.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">May I repeat what I said in my message transmitting Reorganization Plan No. I, that in this as in future reorganization plans not every person will agree on each and every detail. Out of the many groupings and regroupings proposed, a few of the individual agencies conceivably could be placed elsewhere, but I have been seeking to consider the functional purpose of each agency as required by the Reorganization Act itself and have made this plan with the sole purpose of improving the service rendered by the Government to its citizens in accordance with the purposes set out in the act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In view of the fact that it is now May 9, and that any reorganization plan must lie before the Congress for 60 calendar days, and because the reorganization of an intradepartmental character requires a great deal of research and careful painstaking detailed work, I do not propose to send any further general reorganization plans to the Congress at this session.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">However, there are certain transfers, abolitions, and consolidations of committees, commissions, and boards which I propose to do by means of Executive and military orders under existing law as complementary to Reorganization Plan No. II when it becomes effective.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Then, also, by mere administrative procedure, some small agencies which have been listed in various publications as independent establishments but whose independence has no basis in law or in formal Executive or military orders, may be reassigned to an appropriate placement by administrative procedure on the part of their respective heads.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Not all of the interdepartmental transfers and consolidations that are necessary and desirable have been accomplished in this Reorganization Plan No. II. I am directing the Bureau of the Budget to study these problems in order that they may be included in plans to be transmitted to the Congress at its next session.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">For example, in order to save money and to do the work more efficiently there are some units which should be divided so that a part of the work may be done by one agency and a part by another. Take, for example, the business of mapping. It is obviously important that the work of making surveys and accumulating data for maps should be done in the various agencies which are concerned primarily with the purpose for which the map is being drawn. On the other hand, the business of manufacturing maps might very well be consolidated in order to save money, and to manufacture better maps.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have considered the desirability of transferring the jurisdiction over deportable aliens from the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice, but I find that this matter will require further study, or perhaps legislation, and therefore it is not included in this plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have also considered the problem of certain public lands insofar as they present overlapping jurisdiction between the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Insofar as crops, including tree crops, are involved there is something to be said for their retention in the Department of Agriculture. But where lands are to be kept for the primary purpose of recreation and permanent public use and conservation they fall more logically into the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I hope to offer a reorganization plan on this early in the next session.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When I submitted Reorganization Plans I and II at the last regular session of Congress, I indicated that certain reorganizations of an intradepartmental character were necessary but that detailed study would be required for the preparation of specific plans. Since that time the heads of the executive departments and my own office have continued to study the internal organization of the several agencies of the Government. I have considered recommendations made to me as a result of these studies and have found it possible to make a number of needed improvements of organization by administrative action. In other instances, I can effect the necessary changes only under the procedure set up in the Reorganization Act of 1939.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am transmitting herewith Reorganization Plan III, which I have prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Reorganization Act of 1939 (Public, No. 19, 76th Cong., 1st sess.) approved <date date="1939-04-03">April 3, 1939</date>; and I declare that with respect to each reorganization made in this plan, I have found that such reorganization is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes of section 1(a) of the act:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">1. To reduce expenditures;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">2. To increase efficiency;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">3. To consolidate agencies according to major purposes;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">4. To reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions and by abolishing such as may not be necessary; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">5. To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">TREASURY DEPARTMENT</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am proposing two intradepartmental reorganizations relating to the Treasury Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The first reorganization consolidates in a Fiscal Service, under the direction of a permanent Fiscal Assistant Secretary, those functions of the Treasury Department pertaining to financing and fiscal activities. This Fiscal Service will bring together the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, the Office of Commissioner of Accounts and Deposits, and the Public Debt Service, including their various subdivisions and certain other related functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Some adjustments are made in the assignment of functions of the units which will comprise the Fiscal Service, and certain changes are made in titles. The net effect of these adjustments is to establish within the Fiscal Service the Office of Fiscal Assistant Secretary, the Office of the Treasurer of the United States, and a Bureau of Accounts under a Commissioner of Accounts, and a Bureau of Public Debt under the Commissioner of Public Debt. In addition to responsibility for the administration of these four segments of the Department’s operations, the Fiscal Assistant Secretary is vested with the financing functions of the Under Secretary of the Treasury and of the Assistant Secretaries.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions brought together in the Fiscal Service are all closely interrelated and are essential parts of the general functions of financing and fiscal control. The internal organization of the Fiscal Service conforms to accepted principles of financial management and provides the framework for adequate internal controls. At the same time, under the proposed plan these functions can be coordinated more effectively, duplications eliminated, and a more efficient service provided. To assure continued effective management of this highly important and technical phase of the Treasury functions, I am placing the Fiscal Service under the supervision of a career official. The plan, therefore, provides that the Fiscal Assistant Secretary will be appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with civil-service laws and will perform his duties under the general direction of the Secretary. This is in accord with the policy of this administration of bringing higher administrative positions within the career service. The creation of the office of Fiscal Assistant Secretary will not increase the number of Assistant Secretaries in the Treasury Department since the plan expressly provides for the abolition of one of the three existing offices of Assistant Secretary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The second reorganization affecting the Treasury Department vests in the Secretary of the Treasury full authority for the administration of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act. At present the Federal Alcohol Administration occupies an anomalous position. It is legally a part of the Treasury Department, but actually it is clothed with almost complete independence under existing statutory provisions. Under certain conditions the Administration would by law become an independent agency, whereas the interests of improved management require its integration with allied activities in the Treasury Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose, therefore, that the functions of the Federal Alcohol Administration be correlated with the activities of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, particularly its Alcohol Tax Unit. The Bureau is already performing a large part of the field enforcement work of the Administration and could readily take over complete responsibility for its work. The Bureau is daily making, for other purposes, a majority of the contacts with units of the liquor industry which the Federal Alcohol Administration should but cannot make without the establishment of a large and duplicating field force. Under the provisions of this plan, it will be possible more effectively to utilize the far-flung organization of the Treasury Department, including its many laboratories, in discharging the functions of the Federal Alcohol Administration. Thus, I find the proposed consolidation will remedy deficiencies in organization structure as well as afford a more effective service at materially reduced costs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reorganization Plan II transferred the Bureau of Fisheries of the Department of Commerce and the Bureau of Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior and thus concentrated in one department the two bureaus responsible for the conservation and utilization of the wildlife resources of the Nation. On the basis of experience gained since this transfer, I find it necessary and desirable to consolidate these units into a single bureau to be known as the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Bureau of Biological Survey administers Federal laws relating to birds, land mammals, and amphibians whereas the Bureau of Fisheries deals with fishes, marine mammals, and other aquatic animals. The natural areas of operation of these two bureaus frequently coincide, and their activities are interrelated and similar in character. Consolidation will eliminate duplication of work, facilitate coordination of programs, and improve service to the public.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Another provision relating to the Department of the Interior is the abolition of the statutory office of Recorder of the General Land Office. This office is a relic of the quill-and-sand-box period in the transcription of land records. Its duties can readily be absorbed by the regular civil-service personnel of the Land Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to consolidate the Division of Marketing and Marketing Agreements of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation into a single agency to be known as the Surplus Marketing Administration. This consolidation will facilitate the work of the Department of Agriculture relating to the formulation and administration of marketing agreements and the disposition of agricultural surpluses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because the two programs require unified planning and direction, the Secretary of Agriculture has found it desirable to designate the same person as the head of both. In one capacity he reports directly to the Secretary of Agriculture while in the other he is responsible by law to the Administrator of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Consolidation of the two units will assure unified management, eliminate confusion in administration, and make for more efficient operation. Furthermore, this reorganization will remove from the Agricultural Adjustment Administration the legal responsibility for functions which differ administratively from its major operations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">DEPARTMENT OF LABOR</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to abolish the offices of commissioner of immigration and the offices of district commissioner of immigration and naturalization. The former have been vacant since 1933; the latter impose an unnecessary level of supervision above that of district director of immigration and naturalization in certain of our ports and should be eliminated in the interests of economy and sound administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">CIVIL AERONAUTICS AUTHORITY</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to clarify the relations of the Administrator of the Civil Aeronautics Authority and the five-member Board of the Civil Aeronautics Authority. The Administrator is made the chief administrative officer of the Authority with respect to all functions other than those relating to economic regulation and certain other activities primarily of a rule-making and adjudicative character which are entrusted to the Board. This will eliminate the confusion of responsibilities existing under the Civil Aeronautics Act and provide a more clear-cut and effective plan of organization for the agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">IMPROVEMENT AND SAVINGS</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The principal advantage of the reorganizations proposed in this plan will be increased effectiveness of operation of the agencies concerned. In addition to improved service, some economies may be expected. I estimate that immediate annual savings in administrative expense of approximately $150,000 will result. This comparatively small amount in no way measures the worth of the proposals. In fact, if they resulted in no administrative savings at all, I should still consider them worthwhile in view of the increased effectiveness of administration that will result.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">NEED FOR CONTINUOUS STUDY</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The management problems of a department or agency are complex and dynamic and require much detailed analysis before findings can be made. These problems cannot be resolved by any one reorganization plan, nor at one time; their study must be a continuing process if our departmental machinery is to keep pace with the changing requirements placed on the Government. Accordingly, in conformity with the Budget and Accounting Act, I have instructed the Director of the Bureau of the Budget to continue studies in collaboration with the several departments and agencies, looking to further improvements in the Government’s administrative structure.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One year ago the Congress directed the President to investigate the organization of the Executive establishment and to submit plans for such transfers, consolidations, and abolitions of agencies as were found necessary and desirable.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Shortly thereafter I submitted Reorganization Plan No. I which improved the over-all management of the Executive branch. This was followed by Reorganization Plan No. II which effected a better allocation of certain agencies and activities among departments. Although these two plans have been in effect less than a year, their benefits have already been gratifying. I have found the task of coordinating the work of the Executive branch less difficult. Many improvements in service have occurred, and substantial economies have resulted.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reorganization Plan No. III, recently submitted, is a third step which will improve intradepartmental management through internal adjustment in certain agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am now proposing a fourth reorganization plan which provides for a number of interdepartmental reorganizations. These changes are designed to increase efficiency in the administration of Government services by a more logical grouping of certain functions and by a further reduction in the number of independent agencies reporting directly to the Chief Executive.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly, I am transmitting herewith Reorganization Plan No. IV, which, after investigation, I have prepared in pursuance of section 4 of the Reorganization Act of 1939 (Public, No. 19, 76th Cong., 1st sess.) approved <date date="1939-04-03">April 3, 1939</date>; and I declare with respect to each reorganization made in this plan, that I have found such reorganization necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes of section 1 (a) of the act:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">1. To reduce expenditures;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">2. To increase efficiency;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">3. To consolidate agencies according to major purposes;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">4. To reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions and by abolishing such as may not be necessary;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">5. To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan I now transmit I shall describe briefly as follows:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Department of State</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Dominican Customs Receivership is transferred to the Department of State from the Division of Territories and Island Possessions in the Department of the Interior. The State Department is the most appropriate agency to supervise this activity which involves relations with a foreign government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Treasury Department</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers to the Secretary of the Treasury the function of the Attorney General of approving out-of-court settlements—technically termed compromises—of cases arising under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act which have not, prior to compromise, been referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution. The present requirement that the Attorney General approve all compromises results in a cumbersome, time-consuming procedure which the small amounts involved do not warrant. The proposed handling will be simpler, less likely to cause delay, and consistent with the procedure now followed in compromises arising under other acts which the Treasury Department administers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Department of Justice</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Executive Order No. 6166, issued <date date="1933-06-20">June 20, 1933</date>, provided for the centralization of the disbursement function in a Division of Disbursement in the Treasury Department. The resulting increase in efficiency has amply demonstrated the wisdom of centralizing disbursement work. In effectuating the plan, however, I have found it necessary to postpone its application to United States marshals because of the unusual character of their disbursing work in serving the courts. Experience indicates that this arrangement should be continued. I am proposing, therefore, the permanent transfer of the disbursement function of United States marshals from the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Post Office Department</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It has also been found desirable to continue permanently in the Post Office Department the disbursement of Post Office funds. The special character of the work of this Department, involving disbursements in thousands of post offices throughout the Nation, requires here, as well as in the case of the United States marshals, a departure from the sound theory of central disbursing. With its far-flung facilities, the Post Office Department is better equipped to carry on this work than the Division of Disbursement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Another proposal affecting the Post Office Department relates to the transportation of mail and other material between departments. In the early colonial days, the interchange of correspondence and messages was by the simple hand-to-hand method. Gradually a more systematic device became necessary to transport messages, with the resultant evolution of the postal service. Business and private citizens in general have made use of that service, and today we have in our Post Office Department the most efficient organization of its kind in the world. However, here in the Capital City, the Federal Government, instead of utilizing fully the resources of the Post Office Department to maintain its mail and messenger service, has permitted a multiplicity of interdepartmental messenger services, each serving its own department, bureau, or agency. This duplication of services is uneconomical and results in a constant crisscrossing and overlapping of personnel and equipment, all engaged in a common activity. I am sure that the average citizen in Washington, as well as officials of the Government itself, have wondered at this paradox whereby the Federal Government is failing to make the fullest use of one of its own agencies which is specially equipped to render a simple, centralized service for all the other agencies. This reorganization plan proposes to do exactly that; to provide for the transportation of mail, documents, packages, and similar material between all buildings occupied by Government offices on a regularly scheduled basis of sufficient frequency to meet the reasonable and normal requirements of these offices and to reduce to a minimum the constant dispatching of messengers on so-called urgent and emergency errands. This service will be available on a reimbursement basis to the agencies exempted by the Reorganization Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Department of the Interior</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to transfer to the Department of the Interior the activities of the Soil Conservation Service relating to soil and moisture conservation on lands under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department. With respect to private lands, the soil-conservation work of the Federal Government is primarily of a consultative character and can best be carried on by the Department of Agriculture through cooperation of the farmers throughout the country. In the case of Federal lands, this work includes the actual application by the Government of soil-conservation practices and is an appropriate function of the agency administering the land.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Department of Commerce</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One of the purposes of the Reorganization Act is to reduce the number of administrative agencies and thereby simplify the task of executive management. We have made substantial progress toward this objective under previous reorganization plans. I am now proposing another step in this direction by placing the Civil Aeronautics Authority within the framework of the Department of Commerce. Reorganization Plan No. III, which deals with intradepartmental changes, draws a more practical separation between the functions of the Administrator and the Civil Aeronautics Board. In Plan IV, which is concerned with interdepartmental reorganization, I am bringing the Authority into the departmental structure. The Administrator will report to the Secretary of Commerce. The five-member Board, however, will perform its rule-making, adjudicative, and investigative functions independent of the Department. In the interest of efficiency it will be supplied by the Department with budgeting, accounting, procurement, and other office services. As a result of the adjustments provided in Plans III and IV, I believe the Civil Aeronautics Board will be able effectively to carry forward the important work of accident investigation heretofore performed by the Air Safety Board. In addition to the effective and coordinated discharge of accident investigation work which this transfer will facilitate, economies in administration will be possible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The importance of the Weather Bureau’s functions to the Nation’s commerce has also led to the decision to transfer this Bureau to the Department of Commerce. The development of the aviation industry has imposed upon the Weather Bureau a major responsibility in the field of air transportation. The transfer to the Department of Commerce, as provided in this plan, will permit better coordination of Government activities relating to aviation and to commerce generally, without in any way lessening the Bureau’s contribution to agriculture.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Department of Labor</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers to the Secretary of Labor the functions of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the Interior relating to the enforcement of the minimum-wage provisions in contracts for Federal construction. The Secretary of Labor is responsible by law for the determination of the prevailing wage rates included in Government contracts and should properly have complete responsibility for their enforcement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">United States Maritime Commission</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to transfer to the United States Maritime Commission the functions of the Secretary of the Navy relating to State marine and nautical schools. These schools are devoted to training young men for junior officer positions in the merchant marine. The general responsibility for developing facilities for the training of merchant marine personnel is vested in the Maritime Commission. The proposed transfer will thus permit closer coordination of the nautical schools with the training work of the Maritime Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Federal Security Agency</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Federal Security Agency has as its major purposes the promotion of social and economic security, educational opportunity, and the health of the citizens. The functions of Saint Elizabeths Hospital, Freedmen’s Hospital, Howard University, and Columbia Institution for the Deaf plainly come squarely within these purposes. Consequently, I find it necessary and desirable in pursuance of the objectives of the Reorganization Act to transfer to the Federal Security Agency the responsibilities of the Interior Department relating to these institutions. The work of Saint Elizabeths Hospital and Freedmen’s Hospital is much more akin to the activities of the Public Health Service in the Federal Security Agency than to those of any other Federal establishment. Similarly, Howard University and Columbia Institution for the Deaf can derive more benefit from association with the Office of Education in the Federal Security Agency than with any other Federal organization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I further propose to transfer to the Federal Security Agency the Food and Drug Administration with the exception of two activities intimately related to the work of the Department of Agriculture. The work of the Food and Drug Administration is unrelated to the basic functions of the Department of Agriculture. There was, however, no other agency to which these functions more appropriately belonged until the Federal Security Agency was created last year. I now believe that the opportunity for the Food and Drug Administration to develop along increasingly constructive lines lies in this new Agency. There is also need for coordination of certain of its functions with those of the Public Health Service. To accomplish these objectives, the plan establishes the Administration as a separate unit within the Federal Security Agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Economies</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Functions may be transferred or consolidated under this Reorganization Act, but the abolition of functions is prohibited. Congress alone can curtail or abolish functions now provided by law. Savings must come from administrative expenses which comprise only a small fraction of Federal expenditures. This precludes the making of large reductions in expenditure through reorganization plans. The major achievements in reorganizations under this formula must inevitably be found in improved management and more effective service. However, some savings in administrative expenses will be possible under this plan. I estimate the immediate annual savings at approximately $300,000.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Future Reorganization Needs</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plans thus far submitted do not exhaust the transfers, consolidations, and abolitions that may be necessary and desirable. Some changes that now appear to have merit require further study. It is the responsibility of the President as Chief Executive to see that needed adjustments and improvements in administrative organization are made. But this he cannot adequately accomplish without proper statutory authority. The present Reorganization Act entirely exempts some 21 administrative agencies from consideration. Furthermore this act expires on <date date="1941-01-20">January 20, 1941</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I strongly recommend the reenactment of the Reorganization Act, without exemptions. The structure and management of our Government, like the activities and services it performs, must be kept abreast of social and economic change.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Labor (including the Office of the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization) and its functions are transferred to the Department of Justice and shall be administered under the direction and supervision of the Attorney General.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 3. Transfer of Funds</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">So much of the unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds available (including funds available for the fiscal year ending <date date="1941-06-30">June 30, 1941</date>) for the use of the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the Department of Labor in the exercise of functions transferred by this Plan as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget with the approval of the President shall determine, shall be transferred to the Department of Justice for use in connection with the exercise of the functions so transferred. In determining the amount to be transferred the Director of the Bureau of the Budget may include an amount to provide for the liquidation of obligations incurred against such appropriations, allocations, or other funds prior to the transfer: <i>Provided</i>, That the use of the unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds transferred by this section shall be subject to the provisions of sections 4(d)(3) and section 9 of the Reorganization Act of 1939.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When Reorganization Plan No. IV was submitted to Congress, I did not contemplate the transmittal of any additional plans during the current session. However, the startling sequence of international events which has occurred since then has necessitated a review of the measures required for the Nation’s safety. This has revealed a pressing need for the transfer of the immigration and naturalization functions from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice. I had considered such an interdepartmental transfer for some time but did not include it in the previous reorganization plans since much can be said for the retention of these functions in the Department of Labor during normal times. I am convinced, however, that under existing conditions the immigration and naturalization activities can best contribute to the national well-being only if they are closely integrated with the activities of the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am, therefore, transmitting herewith Reorganization Plan No. V which I have prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 4 of the Reorganization Act of 1939 (Public, No. 19, 76th Cong., 1st sess.) approved <date date="1939-04-03">April 3, 1939</date>; and I declare that I have found that such reorganization is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes of section 1(a) (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s133">section 133 of this title</ref>) of the act:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">1. To reduce expenditures;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">2. To increase efficiency;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">3. To consolidate agencies according to major purposes;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">4. To reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions and by abolishing such as may not be necessary; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">5. To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan provides for transferring the Immigration and Naturalization Service from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice. While it is designed to afford more effective control over aliens, this proposal does not reflect any intention to deprive them of their civil liberties or otherwise to impair their legal status. This reorganization will enable the Government to deal quickly with those aliens who conduct themselves in a manner that conflicts with the public interest. No monetary savings are anticipated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I realize that the Congress may adjourn before the termination of the 60-day period provided under the Reorganization Act, but in that event and in view of the urgency of this matter I hope that it will take such action as will permit this plan to go into effect.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The fundamental strength of a nation lies within its people. Military and industrial power are evidences, not the real source of strength. Over the years the prosperity of America and its place in the world will depend on the health, the education, the ingenuity, and the integrity of its people and on their ability to work together and with other nations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The most basic and at the same time the most difficult task of any country is the conservation and development of its human resources. Under our system of government this is a joint responsibility of the Federal, State, and local governments, but in it the Federal Government has a large and vital role to play. Through its research, advice, stimulation, and financial aid, it contributes greatly to progress and to the equalization of standards in the fields of education, health, and welfare; and in the field of social insurance it also directly administers a major segment of the program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To meet its full responsibilities in these fields, the Federal Government requires efficient machinery for the administration of its social programs. Until 1939 the agencies in charge of these activities were scattered in many parts of the Government. In that year President Roosevelt took the first great step toward effective organization in this area when he submitted Reorganization Plan 1, establishing the Federal Security Agency—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">to promote social and economic security, educational opportunity, and the health of the citizens of the Nation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The time has now come for further steps to strengthen the machinery of the Federal Government for leadership and service in dealing with the social problems of the country. Several programs closely bound up with the objectives of the Federal Security Agency are still scattered in other parts of the Government. As the next step, I consider it essential to transfer these programs to the Federal Security Agency and to strengthen its internal organization and management.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Broadly stated, the basic purpose of the Federal Security Agency is the conservation and development of the human resources of the Nation. Within that broad objective come the following principal functions: Child care and development, education, health, social insurance, welfare (in the sense of care of the needy and the defective), and recreation (apart from the operation of parks in the public domain).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These functions constitute a natural family of closely related services, interwoven at many points and in many ways. For example, the development of day-care centers for children has involved joint planning and service by specialists of the Children’s Bureau, the Office of Education, the Public Health Service, and several other agencies. The schools are both a major consumer of public-health services and a leading vehicle for health education and for disseminating the results of research carried on by the Public Health Service. The promotion of social security involves a whole battery of activities, especially social insurance, public assistance, health, and child welfare.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to proceed as promptly as possible with the development of the Federal Security Agency to meet the postwar responsibilities of the Government within its field of activity, I am transmitting herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2, which I have prepared in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of the Reorganization Act of 1945 (Public Law 263, 79th Cong., 1st Sess.), approved <date date="1945-12-20">December 20, 1945</date>; and I declare that, with respect to each reorganization made in this plan, I have found that such reorganization is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes of section 2 (a) of the act—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(1) To facilitate orderly transition from war to peace;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(2) To reduce expenditures and promote economy;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(3) To increase efficiency;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(4) To group, coordinate, and consolidate agencies and functions according to major purposes;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(5) To reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions and to abolish such agencies or functions thereof as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(6) To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">The plan includes certain interagency transfers and several abolitions and changes in the internal organization of the Federal Security Agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers to the Federal Security Administrator the functions of the Children’s Bureau, except those relating to child labor under the Fair Labor Standards Act. These child-labor functions are transferred to the Secretary of Labor in order that they may be performed by, or in close relationship with, the Wage and Hour Division which administers the rest of the act. The plan continues the Children’s Bureau within the Federal Security Agency to deal with problems of child life, but is flexible enough to enable the Administrator to gear in the Bureau’s programs effectively with other activities of the Agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The child-labor program is the only permanent program of the Children’s Bureau that is properly a labor function. The other four—child welfare, crippled children, child and maternal health, and research in problems of child life—all fall within the scope of the Federal Security Agency. The transfer of the Children’s Bureau will not only close a serious gap in the work of the Agency, but it will strengthen the child-care programs by bringing them into closer association with the health, welfare, and educational activities with which they are inextricably bound up.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The promotion of the education, health, welfare, and social security of the Nation is a vast cooperative undertaking of the Federal, State, and local governments. It involves numerous grant-in-aid programs and complex intergovernmental relations. The transfer of the Children’s Bureau will simplify these relations and make for better cooperation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To illustrate, State welfare departments now depend on both the Bureau of Public Assistance in the Federal Security Agency and the Children’s Bureau in the Labor Department for funds for child-care activities. Similarly, State health departments obtain grants from the Public Health Service for general public health work and from the Children’s Bureau for child and maternal health activities. All of these grants involve the establishment of minimum standards and a measure of Federal supervision. The transfer of the Children’s Bureau programs will make it possible to develop more consistent policies and procedures and to simplify dealings with the States. This will eliminate needless inconvenience for both parties and enable the State and Federal Governments to join more efficiently in their common objective of furthering the health and welfare of the American child.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Next, the plan transfers the vital statistics functions of the Census Bureau to the Federal Security Administrator, to be performed through the Public Health Service or other facilities of the Federal Security Agency. In every State but one the State health department is in charge of vital statistics. The work in the States is partially financed from public-health grants administered by the Public Health Service. This transfer will make the agency providing the grants also responsible for carrying on the Federal part of the vital statistics program. Furthermore, it will make for a better correlation of vital statistics with morbidity statistics, which are closely connected in nature and are already handled by the Public Health Service. In addition, the Federal Security Agency, more than any other Federal agency in peacetime, depends on vital statistics and vital records in the operation of its programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers the functions of the United States Employees Compensation Commission to the Federal Security Administrator, and provides for a three-member board of appeals to hear and finally decide appeals on claims of Government employees. By abolishing the Commission, the plan eliminates a small agency and lightens the burden on the President. The Federal Security Administrator, as the head of the Federal agency with the greatest experience in insurance administration, is in the best position to guide and further the program of the Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The abolition of the Commission as an administrative body and the creation of an appeals board will provide the advantages of a single official in charge of operations while affording claimants the protection of a three-member board for the final decision of appeals on claims. This arrangement has proved both administratively efficient and satisfactory to claimants in many similar programs. It is essentially the plan used in the administration of veterans’ pensions and old-age and survivors insurance and employed by many States in their workmen’s compensation programs. The board of appeals created by this plan will deal only with claims of Government employees since appeals on other types of claims under the jurisdiction of the Commission—(a) longshoremen and harbor workers and (b) private employees in the District of Columbia—are heard by the Federal district courts rather than the Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan which created the Federal Security Agency in 1939 provided that the Federal Security Administrator should direct and supervise the Social Security Board, and that he might assign administrative duties to the Chairman of the Board, rather than to the Board as a whole. Thus, it took the first step toward establishing a definite line of responsibility for the administration of social security functions in the Agency. The plan I am now submitting further clarifies these lines of responsibility by providing for the normal type of internal organization used in Federal departments and agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A full-time board in charge of a group of bureaus within an agency is at best an anomaly. The Social Security Board rendered an outstanding service in launching the social-security program, and its members deserve the thanks of the Nation for this achievement. That program, however, is now firmly established and its administration needs to be tied in more fully with other programs of the Federal Security Agency. The existence of a department within a department is a serious barrier to effective integration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to obtain more expeditious and effective direction for the social-security program and to further the development of the Federal Security Agency, this plan transfers the functions of the Social Security Board to the Federal Security Administrator and provides for not more than two new assistant heads of the Agency for the administration of the program. Because of the additional functions transferred to the Administrator by this plan, I have found that these officers will be needed to assist him in the general management of the Agency and to head the constituent unit or units which the Administrator will have to establish for the conduct of social-security activities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To permit a consolidation of work for the blind, the functions of the Office of Education as to the vending-stand program for the blind are transferred to the Federal Security Administrator, in whom are vested other vocational rehabilitation functions. This transfer will permit the program to be assigned to the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, where other vocational rehabilitation activities for the blind are now concentrated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The office of Assistant Commissioner of Education, established by the act of <date date="1930-05-26">May 26, 1930</date>, is abolished. A basic reorganization of the Office of Education within the past year has made this officer the head of one of the divisions of the Office. It is, therefore, administratively desirable to abolish the post of Assistant Commissioner in conformity with the present organization of the Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also abolishes the Federal Board of Vocational Education and its functions. The Board, established by the act of <date date="1917-02-23">February 23, 1917</date>, as amended [<ref href="/us/usc/t20/s11">20 U.S.C. 11</ref> et seq.], formerly had charge of the administration of the vocational-education program. Section 15 of Executive Order 6166, of <date date="1933-06-10">June 10, 1933</date>, issued under authority of the act of <date date="1932-06-30">June 30, 1932</date> (<ref href="/us/stat/47/413">47 Stat. 413</ref>, ch. 314), as amended, transferred the administration of the program to the Office of Education and limited the Board to acting in an advisory capacity. The Advisory Committee on Education, on the basis of its study of the vocational-education system, found that the Board was no longer needed and recommended its abolition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To avoid possible confusion and conflict of authority, the Board of Visitors of St. Elizabeths Hospital and its functions are abolished. The functions of the Board, as provided by section 4842 of the Revised Statutes include supervision of the institution and the adoption of its bylaws, in addition to visiting the institution and advising the superintendent. These functions overlap the responsibilities of the Federal Security Administrator for the general supervision and direction of the hospital.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to enable the Administrator more adequately to coordinate the administration of the grant-in-aid programs vested by statute in the constituent units of the Federal Security Agency, the plan provides that, insofar as practicable and consistent with the applicable legislation, he shall establish uniform standards and procedures for these programs and permit States to submit a single plan of operation for related grant-in-aid programs. Most of these programs involve the establishment of certain minimum standards on fiscal, personnel, and other aspects of administration in the States. In many cases the same State agency is operating under two or more grant-in-aid programs. Much needless inconvenience and confusion can be avoided for all concerned by unifying Federal standards and combining State plans for the operation of the programs in such cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After careful consideration of a number of other agencies and functions I have refrained from proposing in this plan their transfer to the Federal Security Agency. Most of these involve activities which, though related to the functions of the Federal Security Agency, are incidental to the purpose of other agencies or are connected so closely with such agencies as to make transfer undesirable. A few are activities which should probably be shifted in whole or in part to the Federal Security Agency, but I believe such shifts can best be accomplished by interagency agreement or action in connection with appropriations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan here presented is a second important step in building a central agency for the administration of Federal activities primarily relating to the conservation and development of human resources; but, while this step is important in itself, I believe that a third step should soon be taken. The time is at hand when that agency should be converted into an executive department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The size and scope of the Federal Security Agency and the importance of its functions clearly call for departmental status and a permanent place in the President’s Cabinet. In number of personnel and volume of expenditures the Agency exceeds several of the existing departments. Much more important, the fundamental character of its functions—education, health, welfare, social insurance—and their significance for the future of the country demand for it the highest level of administrative leadership and a voice in the central councils of the executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly, I shall soon recommend to the Congress that legislation be promptly enacted making the Federal Security Agency an executive department, defining its basic purpose, and authorizing the President to transfer to it such units and activities as come within that definition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The people expect the Federal Government to meet its full responsibilities for the conservation and development of the human resources of the Nation in the years that lie ahead. This reorganization plan and the legislation that I shall propose will provide the broad and firm foundation required for the accomplishment of that objective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1946, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1945.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan contains reorganizations affecting a number of departments and establishments. Some continue on a permanent basis changes made by Executive order under authority of the First War Powers Act. A few make adjustments in the distribution of functions among agencies. The remainder deal with problems of organization within individual agencies. All are concerned with improving and simplifying particular phases of Government administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each proposal is explained in more detail under the appropriate heading below.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization contained in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1945.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">department of the treasury</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were transferred from the Department of Commerce to the Coast Guard and the Bureau of Customs in 1942 by Executive order under the First War Powers Act. This arrangement has been proved successful by the experience of the past 4 years. Part I of the reorganization plan continues the arrangement on a permanent basis.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">united states coast guard</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The principal functions of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were those of the inspection of vessels and their equipment, the licensing and certificating of officers and seamen, and related functions designed to safeguard the safety of life and property at sea. Thus these functions are related to the regular activities and general purposes of the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard administered them successfully during the tremendous expansion of wartime shipping, by virtue of improvements in organization and program, many of which ought to be continued.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also transfers to the Coast Guard the functions of the collectors of customs relating to the award of numbers to undocumented vessels. These functions, too, were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard in 1942.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">bureau of customs</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers to the Commissioner of Customs the functions of the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation and the Secretary of Commerce, relating to the documentation of vessels, measurement of vessels, administration of tonnage tax and tolls, entry and clearance of vessels and aircraft, regulation of coastwise trade and fisheries, recording of conveyances and mortgages of vessels, and protection of steerage passengers. These functions have always been performed at the ports by the customs service, although legal responsibility for their supervision was vested in the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation and the Secretary of Commerce until transferred temporarily to the Commissioner of Customs under the wartime reorganization power.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proposed transfer will permit more efficient administration by ending divided responsibility.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Functions With Respect to Certain Insane Persons</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Prior to World War I practically all mental patients for whom the Federal Government was legally obligated to provide hospital care and treatment, including personnel of the armed forces, were hospitalized in St. Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, D. C. In addition, this hospital served as the mental hospital for the District of Columbia government. Following World War I, the responsibility for hospital care of mentally ill war veterans was assigned to the Veterans’ Administration. Somewhat later, specialized hospital facilities were provided by the Bureau of Prisons of the Department of Justice to enable that agency to care for prisoners suffering from mental disorders.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With the growth in the population of the District of Columbia and the wartime expansion of the armed forces, the facilities of St. Elizabeths Hospital became inadequate. The War Department therefore established its own mental hospitals at the outset of World War II. Furthermore it became necessary a year ago for the Navy Department to discontinue the use of St. Elizabeths and to assume the responsibility for the care of its mental patients.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the return of the Coast Guard to the Treasury Department, the Public Health Service now provides care in its mental hospitals for personnel of the Coast Guard in accordance with the basic responsibility delegated to it in the Public Health Service Code enacted in 1944. The plan abolishes the functions of St. Elizabeths Hospital with respect to insane persons belonging to the Coast Guard which are provided for by section 4843 of the Revised Statutes [<ref href="/us/usc/t24/s191">24 U.S.C. 191</ref>].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Responsibility for the care of mental patients has been allocated on the basis of the four broad categories of beneficiaries, namely, (1) veterans, to be cared for by the Veterans’ Administration; (2) military and naval personnel, to be cared for by the War and Navy Departments; (3) prisoners, for whom the Department of Justice will be responsible; and (4) other civilians, to be cared for by the Federal Security Agency. The reorganization plan, in order to carry out this policy, provides for the transfer or abolition of certain functions and legal responsibilities now resting with the Federal Security Administrator and Superintendent of St. Elizabeths Hospital.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">navy department</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Hydrographic Office and Naval Observatory</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers the Hydrographic Office and the Naval Observatory from the Bureau of Naval Personnel to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations. The plan would confirm and make permanent the action taken in 1942 by Executive Order No. 9126. Under the First War Powers Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions performed by both the Hydrographic Office and the Naval Observatory relate primarily to operational matters and thus are more appropriately placed in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations than in the Bureau of Naval Personnel. This fact was recognized in the realinement of naval functions at the outbreak of the war. The plan merely confirms an organizational relationship which has existed successfully for the past 4 years.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Supply Department of the United States Marine Corps</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan consolidates the Paymaster’s Department and the Quartermaster’s Department of the United States Marine Corps into a single Supply Department. This consolidation will establish in the Marine Corps an integrated supply organization which parallels that of the Navy Department’s Bureau of Supplies and Accounts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The consolidation will make possible a more efficient and more economical organization of the companion functions of supply and disbursement, eliminating the present handling of related items by two separate departments of the Corps.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>The Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At the present time, the National Park Service, the Public Buildings Administration, and the Archivist of the United States all perform “housekeeping” functions at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library and home at Hyde Park. The plan unifies in the National Park Service responsibility for activities of this character at Hyde Park—that is, the maintenance and protection of buildings and grounds, the collection of fees, and the handling of traffic and visitors. Because of its wide experience in the administration of historic sites, the National Park Service is the logical agency to assume the combined functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Transfer of these functions does not affect the responsibility of the Archivist for the contents and professional services of the library proper. It also does not affect the present disposition of the receipts, which is provided by law.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of the Interior now administers the mining and mineral leasing laws on various areas of the public lands, including those national forests established on parts of the original public domain. The Department of Agriculture, on the other hand, has jurisdiction with respect to mineral deposits on (1) forest lands acquired under the Weeks Act, (2) lands acquired in connection with the rural rehabilitation program, and (3) lands acquired by the Department as a part of the Government’s effort to retire submarginal lands.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly this reorganization plan provides that these mineral deposits on lands of the Department of Agriculture will be administered by the Department of the Interior, which already has the bulk of the Federal Government’s mineral leasing program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan further provides that the administration of mineral leasing on these lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture will be carried on subject to limitations necessary to protect the surface uses for which these lands were primarily acquired.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Bureau of Land Management</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan consolidates the General Land Office and the Grazing Service of the Department of the Interior into a Bureau of Land Management.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The General Land Office and the Grazing Service now divide responsibility for the major portion of the multiple-use federally owned lands now held by the Department of the Interior. The lands under jurisdiction of the two agencies are comparable in character and in use. In some functions the two agencies employ the same type of personnel and use the same techniques. Other functions are divided between the agencies, so that both are engaged in management of various aspects of the same land. Consolidating these two agencies will permit the development of uniform policies and the integration of two organizations whose responsibilities now overlap.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Integration of the activities of the two agencies will make possible greater utilization and thus more economic use of expert skills. The same practical experience embraced in range administration on public lands in grazing districts will be available for public lands outside the districts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Utilization of lands within grazing districts for nongrazing purposes will be subject to only one classification examination, rather than dual examination as is now necessary. Economy will be possible in the construction of range improvements, wherever feasible, to serve lands both in and out of districts. Legal procedures, such as adjudication of issues relating to licenses and leases, hearings on appeal from administrative decisions, and the processing of trespass cases, will benefit from unified administration and handling.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In such activities as fire protection, soil and moisture conservation, management of public lands under agreement with other agencies (e.g., Bureau of Reclamation), range surveys, maintenance and improvement of stock driveways, and stabilization of range use on all public domain, the benefits of consolidation will become increasingly apparent. Further, records relating to grazing lands can be concentrated in fewer field offices and hence administered more effectively.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While the establishment of a new Bureau of Land Management under a Director involves the abolition of the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioners of the General Land Office, the Director and Assistant Directors of Grazing, the Registers of District Land Offices, and the United States Supervisor of Surveys, the statutory functions now discharged by these officers are in no way modified. This plan will place final responsibility for these functions in the Secretary of the Interior and make him responsible for their performance in coordination with the other land activities of his Department. Officers whose offices are specifically abolished, but whose experience will make them valuable to the Department, should be available for appointment in the new Bureau.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found and declare that by reason of the reorganization made by the plan the responsibilities and duties of the Bureau of Land Management are of such nature as to require the inclusion in the plan of provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Director, an Associate Director, and Assistant Directors.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Functions of Certain Agencies of the Department of Agriculture</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To enable the Department of Agriculture to meet its responsibilities for food production and distribution during the war, there was early and continuing coordination of its programs directly concerned with these phases of the food problem. Beginning with Executive Order No. 9069 of <date date="1942-02-23">February 23, 1942</date>, those programs and agencies dealing with food production and distribution were gradually consolidated by a series of Executive orders issued under the authority of the First War Powers Act. By Executive Order No. 9334 of <date date="1943-04-19">April 19, 1943</date>, they were all grouped into a War Food Administration, under a War Food Administrator.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the fighting was drawing to a close and the emergency purposes of the War Food Administration had been largely accomplished, this Administration was terminated by Executive Order No. 9577 of <date date="1945-06-29">June 29, 1945</date>, and its functions and agencies were transferred back to the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture. Executive Order No. 9577 also authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to organize and administer the transferred functions and agencies in the manner which he deemed best.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under this authority the Secretary established the Production and Marketing Administration in August 1945. Into this Administration he consolidated the functions of many of the production and marketing agencies which were transferred back from the War Food Administration. Included were the functions of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the Surplus Marketing Administration and the administration of the programs of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers these functions to the Secretary of Agriculture, in order to permit him to continue the consolidation already effected in the Production and Marketing Administration. This provision makes it possible to maintain the close coordination and integration of food-production and distribution programs, with the resulting benefits that were achieved during the war. It also provides the Secretary with the necessary flexibility to make adjustments in the coordination and administration of these programs to meet changing conditions and new problems, a flexibility which he particularly needs at this period of acute food shortages throughout the world.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">department of commerce</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Certain Functions of National Bureau of Standards</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers the functions of two Divisions of the National Bureau of Standards in the Department of Commerce, namely, the Division of Simplified Trade Practices and the Division of Commercial Standards, to the Secretary of Commerce. The transfer will permit the Secretary to reassign these functions to the Office of Domestic Commerce, which is the focal point of the Department’s general service functions for American business.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These two Divisions were established as a result of the standardization work initiated in World War I. Both Divisions have followed the same basic procedure of assisting the producers and the consumers of particular products to agree among themselves on certain standards or on a certain limited number of varieties. Each such voluntary agreement is then published by the National Bureau of Standards and, although not compulsory, has tended to become the generally accepted practice in the trade.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Standardization again proved to be an important device for accelerating production in World War II, and industry has shown renewed interest in continuing these wartime conservation and rationalization programs on a voluntary basis in the production of peacetime products.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The desirability of the proposed transfer was emphasized only a few months ago by the report of a committee of prominent businessmen appointed by the Secretary of Commerce to review the entire question of the Government’s activities in this field. These studies indicate that two major benefits will result from the transfer.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">First, the association of the two Divisions with the National Bureau of Standards has perhaps tended to give the impression in some quarters that voluntary standards and trade practices worked out by industry with the help of these two Divisions are in some sense Government standards which are enforced on the basis of scientific and objective tests. The transfer of these two Divisions to the Department proper would reduce any such misconceptions, and make it clear that these standards and simplified practices are voluntary industry agreements in the making of which the Government acts merely in an advisory capacity.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, the other general services of the Department to American business, such as marketing, management, and economic and statistical services, are now concentrated in the Office of Domestic Commerce. The association of these two Divisions with these other services to business will facilitate their work and enable them to make use of the wide industrial and business contacts of the Office of Domestic Commerce.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Strike Ballots Under the War Labor Disputes Act</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan abolishes the function of conducting strike ballots which was vested in the National Labor Relations Board by section 8 of the War Labor Disputes Act (<ref href="/us/stat/57/167">57 Stat. 167</ref>, ch. 144). Experience indicates that such elections under the act do not serve to reduce the number of strikes and may even aggravate labor difficulties. The Congress has already forbidden the Board to expend any of its appropriations for the current fiscal year for this activity (First Deficiency Appropriation Act of 1946). I believe that the function should now be permanently abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">smithsonian institution</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered"><i>Canal Zone Biological Area</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers responsibility for the Canal Zone Biological Area to the Smithsonian Institution. At present the Canal Zone Biological Area is an independent agency of the Government, having as its function the administration of Barro Colorado Island in Gatun Lake as a tropical wildlife preserve and research laboratory. The Board of Directors of this agency consists of the President of the National Academy of Sciences as Chairman, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, three members of the Cabinet—the Secretaries of War, Interior, and Agriculture—and three biologists.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer will locate this function with comparable and related functions already assigned to the Smithsonian Institution whose staff members have participated since the beginning in developing the island as a research center. It will reduce by one the number of Government agencies. It will relieve three Cabinet members of routine duties not important enough to warrant their personal attention.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under its existing authority the Smithsonian Institution may constitute an advisory board of biologists and departmental representatives if it finds such action necessary.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan transfers to the United States Employment Service the functions of the Selective Service System and its Director with respect to assisting ex-servicemen in obtaining new positions. These functions directly overlap the regular placement activities of the United States Employment Service, which is required to provide a special placement service for veterans both by its basic act and by the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944. The transfer is in line with the policy of the Congress on the placement of veterans as most recently expressed in the 1944 act. The shift will prevent needless duplication of personnel and facilities and will assure the best service to veterans.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am transmitting herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1947. The provisions of this plan are designed to maintain organizational arrangements worked out under authority of title I of the First War Powers Act. The plan has a twofold objective: to provide for more orderly transition from war to peacetime operation and to supplement my previous actions looking toward the termination of wartime legislation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The First War Powers Act provides that title I—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I26" class="indent2 firstIndent-2">  shall remain in force during the continuance of the present war and for six months after the termination of the war, or until such earlier time as the Congress by concurrent resolution or the President may designate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">Upon the termination of this title all changes in the organization of activities and agencies effected under its authority expire and the functions revert to their previous locations unless otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Altogether nearly 135 Executive orders have been issued in whole or in part under title I of the First War Powers Act. The internal organization of the War and Navy Departments has been drastically overhauled under this authority. Most of the emergency agencies, which played so vital a role in the successful prosecution of the war, were based in whole or in part upon this title. Without the ability, which these provisions afforded, to adjust the machinery of government to changing needs, it would not have been possible to develop the effective, hard-hitting organization which produced victory. The organization of war activities had to be worked out step by step as the war program unfolded and experience pointed the way. That was inevitable. The problems and the functions to be performed were largely new. Conditions changed continually and often radically. Speed of action was essential. But with the aid of title I of the First War Powers Act, it was possible to gear the administrative machinery of the Government to handle the enormous load thrust upon it by the rapidly evolving war program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since VJ-day this same authority has been used extensively in demobilizing war agencies and reconverting the governmental structure to peacetime needs. This process has been largely completed. The bulk of temporary activities have ceased, and most of the continuing functions transferred during the war have already been placed in their appropriate peacetime locations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The organizational adjustments which should be continued are essentially of two types: First, changes in the organization of permanent functions, which have demonstrated their advantage during the war years. Second, transfers of continuing activities which were vested by statute in temporary war agencies but have since been moved by Executive order upon the termination of these agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In most cases the action necessary to maintain organizational gains made under title I of the First War Powers Act can best be taken by the simplified procedure afforded by the Reorganization Act of 1945, the first purpose of which was to facilitate the orderly transition from war to peace. All of the provisions of this plan represent definite improvements in administration. Several are essential steps in demobilizing the war effort. The arrangements they provide for have been reviewed by the Congress in connection with appropriation requests. Since the plan does not change existing organization, savings cannot be claimed for it. However, increased expense and disruption of operations would result if the present organization were terminated and the activities reverted to their former locations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to the matters dealt with in this reorganization plan and in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1947, there are several other changes in organization made under title I of the First War Powers Act on which action should be taken before the termination of the title. The proposed legislation for a National Defense Establishment provides for continuing the internal organizational arrangements made in the Army and Navy pursuant to the First War Powers Act. I have on several occasions recommended the creation of a single agency for the administration of housing programs. Since section 5(e) of the Reorganization Act of 1945 may cast some doubt on my authority to assign responsibility for the liquidation of the Smaller War Plants Corporation by reorganization plan, I recommend that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation be authorized by legislation to continue to liquidate the affairs relating to functions transferred to it from the Smaller War Plants Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is imperative that title I of the First War Powers Act remain effective until all of these matters have been dealt with. An earlier termination of the title would destroy important advances in organization and impair the ability of the executive branch to administer effectively some of the major programs of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2 (a) of the Reorganization Act of 1945. Each of these reorganizations is explained below.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Functions of the Alien Property Custodian</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan provides for the permanent location of the functions vested by statute in the Alien Property Custodian and the Office of Alien Property Custodian. In 1934 the functions of the Alien Property Custodian were transferred to the Department of Justice, where they remained until 1942. Because of the great volume of activity resulting from World War II, a separate Office of Alien Property Custodian was created by Executive Order No. 9095 of <date date="1942-03-11">March 11, 1942</date>. This Office was terminated by Executive Order No. 9788 of <date date="1946-10-14">October 14, 1946</date>, and the functions of the Office and of the Alien Property Custodian were transferred to the Attorney General except for those relating to Philippine property. The latter were transferred simultaneously to the Philippine Alien Property Administration established by Executive Order No. 9789.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While the Trading With the Enemy Act, as amended at the beginning of the war, authorized the President to designate the agency or person in which alien property should vest and to change such designations, subsequent legislation has lodged certain functions in the Alien Property Custodian and the Office of Alien Property Custodian. Similarly, though the Philippine Property Act vested in the President the then existing alien property functions as to Philippine property, certain functions affecting such property have since been established which have been assigned by statute to the Alien Property Custodian.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to maintain the existing arrangements for the administration of alien property and to avoid the confusion which otherwise would occur on the termination of title I of the First War Powers Act, the reorganization plan transfers to the Attorney General all functions vested by law in the Alien Property Custodian and the Office of Alien Property Custodian except as to Philippine property. The functions relating to Philippine property are transferred to the President, to be performed by such officer or agency as he may designate, thus permitting the continued administration of these functions through the Philippine Alien Property Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Approval of Agricultural Marketing Orders</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 8c of the Agricultural Marketing Agreements Act of 1937 provides that marketing orders of the Secretary of Agriculture must in certain cases be approved by the President before issuance. In order to relieve the President of an unnecessary burden, the responsibility for approval was delegated to the Economic Stabilization Director during the war, and was formally transferred to him by Executive Order No. 9705 of <date date="1946-03-15">March 15, 1946</date>. Since the Secretary of Agriculture is the principal adviser of the President in matters relating to agriculture, and since final authority has been assigned to the Secretary by law in many matters of equal or greater importance, the requirement of Presidential approval of individual marketing orders may well be discontinued. Accordingly, the plan abolishes the function of the President relative to the approval of such orders.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Contract Settlement Functions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Office of Contract Settlement was established by law in 1944 and shortly thereafter was placed by statute in the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion. The principal purposes of the Office of Contract Settlement have been to prescribe the policies, regulations, and procedures governing the settlement of war contracts, and to provide an appeal board to hear and decide appeals from the contracting agencies in the settlement of contracts. A remarkable record has been achieved for the rapid settlement of war contracts, but among those which remain are some of the largest and most complex. Considerable time may be required to complete these cases and dispose of the appeals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Though the functions of the Office of Contract Settlement cannot yet be terminated, it is evident that they no longer warrant the maintenance of a separate office. For this reason Executive Order No. 9809 of <date date="1946-12-12">December 12, 1946</date>, transferred the functions of the Director of Contract Settlement to the Secretary of the Treasury and those of the Office of Contract Settlement to the Department of the Treasury. As the central fiscal agency of the executive branch the Treasury Department is clearly the logical organization to carry to conclusion the over-all activities of the contract settlement program. The plan continues the present arrangement and abolishes the Office of Contract Settlement, thereby avoiding its reestablishment as a separate agency on the termination of title I of the First War Powers Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">National Prohibition Act Functions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The act of <date date="1930-05-27">May 27, 1930</date> (<ref href="/us/stat/46/427">46 Stat. 427</ref>), imposed upon the Attorney General certain duties respecting administration and enforcement of the National Prohibition Act. By Executive Order No. 6639 of <date date="1934-03-10">March 10, 1934</date>, all of the powers and duties of the Attorney General respecting that act, except the power and authority to determine and to compromise liability for taxes and penalties, were transferred to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The excepted functions, however, were transferred subsequently to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue by Executive Order No. 9302 of <date date="1943-02-09">February 9, 1943</date>, issued under the authority of title I of the First War Powers Act, 1941.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the functions of determining taxes and penalties under various statutes and of compromise of liability therefor prior to reference to the Attorney General for suit are well-established functions of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, this minor function under the National Prohibition Act is more appropriately placed in the Bureau of Internal Revenue than in the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Agricultural Research Functions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By Executive Order No. 9069 of <date date="1942-02-23">February 23, 1942</date>, six research bureaus, the Office of Experiment Stations, and the Agricultural Research Center were consolidated into an Agricultural Research Administration to be administered by an officer designated by the Secretary of Agriculture. The constituent bureaus and agencies of the Administration have, in practice, retained their separate identity. This consolidation and certain transfers of functions between the constituent bureaus and agencies have all been recognized and provided for in the subsequent appropriation acts passed by the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By the plan the functions of the eight research bureaus and agencies which are presently consolidated into the Agricultural Research Administration are transferred to the Secretary of Agriculture to be performed by him or under his direction and control by such officers or agencies of the Department of Agriculture as he may designate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The benefits which have been derived from centralized review, coordination, and control of research projects and functions by the Agricultural Research Administrator have amply demonstrated the lasting value of this consolidation. By transferring the functions of the constituent bureaus and agencies to the Secretary of Agriculture, it will be possible to continue this consolidation and to make such further adjustments in the organization of agricultural research activities as future conditions may require. This assignment of functions to the Secretary is in accord with the sound and long-established practice of the Congress of vesting substantive functions in the Secretary of Agriculture rather than in subordinate officers or agencies of the Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Credit Union Functions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan makes permanent the transfer of the administration of Federal functions with respect to credit unions to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. These functions, originally placed in the Farm Credit Administration, were transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by Executive Order No. 9148 of <date date="1942-04-27">April 27, 1942</date>. Most credit unions are predominantly urban institutions, and the credit-union program bears very little relation to the functions of the Farm Credit Administration. The supervision of credit unions fits in logically with the general bank supervisory functions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation since 1942 has successfully administered the credit-union program, and the supervision of credit-union examiners has been integrated into the field and departmental organization of the Corporation. In the interests of preserving an organizational arrangement which operates effectively and economically, the program should remain in its present location.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">War Assets Administration</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present organization for the disposal of surplus property is the product of 2½ years of practical experience. Beginning with the Surplus Property Board in charge of general policy and a group of agencies designated by it to handle the disposal of particular types of property, the responsibility for most of the surplus disposal has gradually been drawn together in one agency—the War Assets Administration—headed by a single Administrator. Experience has demonstrated the desirability of centralized responsibility in administering this most difficult program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan will continue the centralization of surplus disposal functions in a single agency headed by an Administrator. This is accomplished by transferring the functions, personnel, property, rec­ords, and funds of the War Assets Administration created by Executive order to the statutory Surplus Property Administration. In order to avoid confusion and to maintain the continuity of operations, the name of the Surplus Property Administration is changed to War Assets Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because the plan combines in one agency, not only the policy functions now vested by statute in the Surplus Property Administrator, but also the immense disposal operations now concentrated in the temporary War Assets Administration, I have found it necessary to provide in the plan for an Associate War Assets Administrator, also appointed by the President with the approval of the Senate. It is essential that there be an officer who can assist the Administrator in the general management of the agency and who can take over the direction of its operations in case of the absence or disability of the Administrator or of a vacancy in his office.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am transmitting herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1947, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1945. This plan deals solely with housing. It simplifies, and increases the efficiency of, the administrative organization of permanent housing functions and provides for the administration of certain emergency housing activities pending their liquidation. I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2 (a) of the Reorganization Act of 1945.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The provision of adequate housing will remain a major national objective throughout the next decade. The primary responsibility for meeting housing needs rests, and must continue to rest, with private industry, as I have stated on other occasions. The Federal Government, however, has an important role to play in stimulating and facilitating home construction.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Over the years the Congress has provided for a number of permanent housing programs, each involving a special approach to the basic objective of more adequate housing for our citizens. The Congress first enacted a series of measures to facilitate home construction and home ownership by strengthening the savings and loan type of home-financing institution. These measures established a credit reserve system for such agencies, authorized the chartering of Federal savings and loan associations to provide more adequate home financing facilities, and provided for the insurance of investments in savings and loan institutions in order to attract savings into this field. The Congress also created a system for the insurance of home loans and mortgages to stimulate the flow of capital into home-mortgage lending and thereby facilitate home ownership and improvement and increase home construction. These measures were supplemented by legislation extending financial assistance to local communities for the clearance of slums and the provision of decent housing for families of low income who otherwise would be forced to live in the slums. It is significant that these programs were first established, and have been continued, by the Congress because of their special contributions to home construction and improvement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my message of January 6 on the state of the Union, I recommended legislation establishing certain additional programs to help to alleviate the housing shortage and achieve our national objective of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family. No lesser objective is commensurate with the productive capacity and resources of the country or with the dignity which a true democracy accords the individual citizen. The Congress is now considering measures authorizing these programs. I again recommend the early enactment of this legislation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But whatever may be the permanent housing functions of the Government, whether they be confined to the existing programs or supplemented as the Congress may determine, they are inevitably interrelated. They require coordination and supervision so that each will render its full contribution without conflict with the performance of other housing functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Government, however, lacks an effective permanent organization to coordinate and supervise the administration of its principal housing programs. These programs and the machinery for their administration were established piecemeal over a period of years. The present consolidation of housing agencies and functions in the National Housing Agency is only temporary. After the termination of title I of the First War Powers Act this agency will dissolve and the agencies and functions now administered in it will revert to their former locations in the Government. When this occurs, the housing programs of the Government will be scattered among some 13 agencies in 7 departments and independent establishments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I need hardly point out that such a scattering of these interrelated functions would not only be inefficient and wasteful but also would seriously impair their usefulness. It would leave the Government without effective machinery for the coordination and supervision of its housing activities and would thrust upon the Chief Executive an impossible burden of administrative supervision.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The grouping of housing functions in one establishment is essential to assure that the housing policies established by the Congress will be carried out with consistency of purpose and a minimum of friction, duplication, and overlapping. A single establishment will unquestionably make for greater efficiency and economy. Moreover, it will simplify the task of the Congress and the Chief Executive by enabling them to deal with one official and hold one person responsible for the general supervision of housing functions, whereas otherwise they will be forced to deal with a number of uncoordinated officers and agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is vital that a sound permanent organization of housing activities be established at the earliest possible date in order to insure that housing functions will not be scattered among numerous agencies, with consequent confusion and disruption. To avoid this danger, and to accomplish the needed changes promptly, it is desirable to employ a reorganization plan under the Reorganization Act of 1945. No other area of Federal activity affords greater opportunity than housing for accomplishing the objectives of the Reorganization Act to group, consolidate, and coordinate functions, reduce the number of agencies, and promote efficiency and economy; and in no other area could the application of the Reorganization Act be more appropriate and necessary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In brief, this reorganization plan groups nearly all of the permanent housing agencies and functions of the Government, and the remaining emergency housing activities, in a Housing and Home Finance Agency, with the following constituent operating agencies: <i>(a)</i> A Home Loan Bank Board to administer the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, and the functions of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its members; <i>(b)</i> a Federal Housing Administration with the same functions as now provided by law for that agency; and <i>(c)</i> a Public Housing Administration to take over the functions of the United States Housing Authority and certain remaining emergency housing activities pending the completion of their liquidation. Each constituent agency will possess its individual identity and be responsible for the operation of its program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By reason of the reorganizations made by the plan, I have found it necessary to include therein provisions for the appointment of (1) an Administrator to head the Housing and Home Finance Agency, (2) the three members of the Home Loan Bank Board, and (3) two Commissioners to head the Federal Housing Administration and the Public Housing Administration, respectively. Each of these officers is to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan places in the Housing and Home Finance Administrator the functions heretofore vested in the Federal Loan Administrator and the Federal Works Administrator with respect to the housing agencies and functions formerly administered within the Federal Loan and Federal Works Agencies, together with supervision and direction of certain emergency housing activities for the remainder of their existence.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the plan the Home Loan Bank Board and the Federal Housing Administration will have the same status in, and relation to, the Housing and Home Finance Agency and the Housing and Home Finance Administrator as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and its related agencies, and the Federal Housing Administration formerly had to the Federal Loan Agency and the Federal Loan Administrator. Similarly, the Public Housing Administration will have the same status in, and relation to, the Housing and Home Finance Agency and the Administrator as the United States Housing Authority formerly had to the Federal Works Agency and the Federal Works Administrator.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since there are a few housing activities which it is not feasible to place within the Housing and Home Finance Agency because they form integral parts of other broad programs or because of specific limitations in the Reorganization Act of 1945, the plan also created a National Housing Council on which the Housing and Home Finance Agency and its constituent agencies, and the other departments and agencies having important housing functions, are represented. In this way the plan provides machinery for promoting the most effective use of all the housing functions of the Government, for obtaining consistency between these functions and the general economic and fiscal policies of the Government, and for avoiding duplication and overlapping of activities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To avoid a hiatus in the administration of housing functions, pending the confirmation by the Senate of the new officers provided for by the plan, it permits the designation by the President of appropriate existing housing officials to perform temporarily the functions of these officers. This period should be brief, as I shall promptly submit nominations for the permanent officers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the limitations contained in the Reorganization Act of 1945, the compensation of the Housing and Home Finance Administrator and the other officers provided for by the plan, cannot be fixed at a rate in excess of $10,000 per annum. Both the temporary National Housing Administrator, provided for by Executive Order No. 9070 and the Federal Housing Administrator, have received salaries of $12,000 a year. I do not consider the salary of $10,000 provided in the plan as compensation commensurate with the responsibilities of the Administrator, the members of the Home Loan Bank Board, and the Commissioners of the other constituent agencies, or consistent with a salary scale which must be paid if the Government is to attract and retain public servants of the requisite caliber. Accordingly, I recommend that the Congress act to increase the salary of the Housing and Home Finance Administrator to $15,000 per annum, and to increase the salaries of the members of the Home Loan Bank Board and the two Commissioners provided for by this plan to $12,000 per annum.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The essential and important difference between the organization established by the plan and the prewar arrangement, to which housing agencies and functions would otherwise automatically revert on the termination of title I of the First War Powers Act, is that under the old arrangement these agencies and functions were scattered among many different establishments primarily dealing with matters other than housing, whereas under the plan the major permanent housing programs are placed in a single establishment concerned exclusively with housing. Thus, the plan effectuates the basic objective enunciated by the Congress in the Reorganization Act of 1945 of grouping agencies and functions by major purpose, and provides the necessary framework for a more effective administration of Federal housing activities in the postwar period.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1949, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan transfers the Bureau of Employment Security, now in the Federal Security Agency, to the Department of Labor and vests in the Secretary of Labor the functions of the Federal Security Administrator with respect to employment services and unemployment compensation, the latter of which is now more commonly referred to as unemployment insurance. The plan also transfers to the Secretary of Labor the functions of the Veterans’ Placement Service Board and of its Chairman and abolishes that Board. These changes are in general accord with recommendations made by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1949 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of said act. The primary benefits from these reorganizations will take the form of improvements in administration and service. It is probable that a significant reduction in expenditures will result from the taking effect of the plan as compared with the current estimates and work-load assumptions contained in the 1950 budget as amended, but an itemization of such savings is not possible in advance of the transfer.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One of the major needs of the executive branch is a sound and effective organization of labor functions. More than 35 years ago the Federal Government’s labor functions were brought together in the Department of Labor. In recent years, however, the tendency has been to disperse such functions throughout the Government. New labor programs have been placed outside of the Department and some of its most basic functions have been transferred from the Department to other agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my judgment, this course has been fundamentally unsound and should be reversed. The labor programs of the Federal Government constitute a family of interrelated functions requiring generally similar professional training and experience, involving numerous overlapping problems, and calling for strong, unified leadership. Together they form one of the most important areas of Federal activity. It is imperative that the Labor Department be strengthened and restored to its original position as the central agency of the Government for dealing with labor problems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">bureau of employment security</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One of the most essential steps in improving the organization of labor functions is the transfer of the Bureau of Employment Security to the Department of Labor. This Bureau administers the activities of the Federal Government with respect to employment services and unemployment insurance. These activities mainly involve the review and apportionment of grants-in-aid, approval of State plans and grants, the conduct of research and developmental activities, and the provision of advice and assistance to the State agencies which actually conduct the services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Public employment services and unemployment insurance are companion programs inextricably interrelated both in purpose and operation. The first assists workers in finding jobs and employers in obtaining workers; the second provides cash benefits for the support of workers and their families when suitable jobs cannot be obtained. Thus, each complements the other. At the local operating level the two programs are almost invariably carried on in the same unit—the local employment office. At the State level they are administered by the same agency in nearly every State. As a result, an unusually high degree of coordination at the Federal level is essential.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There can be no question as to the basic consideration which must govern the administration of both of these programs. From the standpoint of all interested parties—the worker, the employer, and the public—the primary concern is employment. Essential as they are, unemployment benefits at a fraction of regular wages are a poor substitute for the earnings from a steady job. In the administration of these programs, therefore, primary attention must be focused on achieving the maximum effectiveness of the employment services. On them depend the prosperity and well-being of the worker and the extent of the unemployment-compensation burden on the employer and the public.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have long been convinced that the Department of Labor is the agency which can contribute most to the development of sound and efficient employment service. It has the understanding of employment problems and of the operation of the labor market which is essential in this field. It possesses the necessary specialists and the wealth of information on occupations, employment trends, wage rates, working conditions, labor legislation and other matters essential to employment counseling and placement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Close working relations between the United States Employment Service and most of the agencies of the Labor Department are vital to the success of both. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has a fund of information on employment and occupations which is basic to the planning and operation of the Service. The Women’s Bureau and the Child Labor Branch of the Wage and Hour Division afford expert advice on employment problems relating to women and adolescents. The Bureau of Labor Standards can assist the Service on questions of working conditions and other labor standards, and the Bureau of Apprenticeship on occupational-training problems. At the same time the various agencies of the Labor Department need the detailed current information on labor problems and the condition of the labor market which the United States Employment Service possesses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Experience has demonstrated that unemployment insurance must be administered in close relationship with employment service and other employment programs. In many of our industrial States, and in most foreign countries, unemployment insurance is administered by the agency responsible for labor functions. Furthermore, the unemployment-insurance system has a vital stake in the effectiveness of the program for employment services, for what benefits the employment service also benefits the unemployment-insurance program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer of the Bureau of Employment Security, including the United States Employment Service and the Unemployment Insurance Service, together with the functions thereof, will give assurance that primary emphasis will be placed on the improvement of the employment services and that maximum effort will be made to provide jobs in lieu of cash benefits.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also transfers to the Department of Labor the Federal Advisory Council created by the act establishing the United States Employment Service. This Council consists of outstanding representatives of labor, management, and the public who are especially familiar with employment problems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">veterans’ placement service board</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although the Veterans’ Employment Service operates through the regular employment office system, its policies are determined by the Veterans’ Placement Service Board created by the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944. This Board consists of the heads of three Federal agencies, only one of which administers employment services. Furthermore, the full-time director of the Service is appointed by the Chairman of this Board, who is not otherwise engaged in employment-service activity, rather than by the head of the agency within which the service is administered. Such an arrangement is cumbersome and results in an undue division of authority and responsibility.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to simplify the administration of the Veterans’ Employment Service and assure the fullest cooperation between it and the general employment service, the plan eliminates the Veterans’ Placement Service Board and transfers its functions and those of its Chairman to the Secretary of Labor. By thus concentrating responsibility for the success of the Service, the plan will make for better service to the veteran seeking employment or vocational counseling.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan is a major step in the rebuilding and strengthening of the Department of Labor, which I am convinced is essential to the sound and efficient organization of the executive branch of the Government.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1949, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan constitutes an important first step in strengthening the organization of the Post Office Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One of the prime essentials of good departmental administration is authority from the Congress to a department head to organize and control his department. The Commission on Organization of the executive branch of the Government emphasized in its first and subsequent reports that separate authorities to subordinates should be eliminated. The plan gives the Postmaster General the necessary authority to organize and control his Department by transferring to him the functions of all subordinate officers and agencies of the Post Office Department, including the functions of each Assistant Postmaster General, the Purchasing Agent, the Comptroller, and the Bureau of Accounts. The Postmaster General is authorized to delegate to subordinates designated by him such of his functions as he may deem appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Postmaster General is responsible for the management of one of the world’s largest businesses. Like the head of any large business, the Postmaster General should be given adequate top-level assistance in carrying on the operations of the Department so that he may have time to devote to matters of departmental and public policy. In order to provide needed assistance to the Postmaster General, the plan establishes the positions of Deputy Postmaster General, and four Assistant Postmasters General, comparable to the positions of Under Secretary and Assistant Secretaries in other departments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also establishes an Advisory Board for the Post Office Department, composed of the Postmaster General, the Deputy Postmaster General, and seven other members representing the public who shall be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Advisory Board will make available to the Postmaster General the advice of outstanding private citizens and will afford a useful channel for the interchange of views between postal officials and the public concerning the operations of the postal service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found after investigation that each reorganization contained in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949. I have also found and hereby declare that by reason of the reorganization made by this plan, it is necessary to include in the plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the Deputy Postmaster General, four Assistant Postmasters General, and members of the Advisory Board for the Post Office Department. The plan abolishes the Bureau of Accounts of the Post Office Department and the offices of Comptroller, Purchasing Agent, First, Second, Third, and Fourth Assistant Postmasters General.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan carries into effect those of the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government respecting the Post Office Department which can be accomplished under the provisions of the Reorganization Act. I am also transmitting to the Congress recommendations for legislation which will implement other recommendations of the Commission and place the operations of the Post Office Department on a more businesslike basis.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The primary result of this reorganization plan will be more effective administration. Although a substantial reduction in expenditures will not be brought about by the plan alone, major economies can be achieved over a period of time as a result of this plan and the enactment of the postal legislation which I am recommending to the Congress.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Security Council and the National Security Resources Board, together with their respective functions, records, property, personnel, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds (available or to be made available), are hereby transferred to the Executive Office of the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1949, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers the National Security Council and the National Security Resources Board to the Executive Office of the President. After investigation I have found, and I hereby declare, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The growth of the executive branch and the increasingly complex nature of the problems with which it must deal have greatly intensified the necessity of strong and well-coordinated staff facilities to enable the President to meet his responsibilities for the effective administration of the executive branch of the Government. Ten years ago several of the staff agencies of the executive branch were brought together in the Executive Office of the President under the immediate direction of the President. The wisdom of this step has been demonstrated by greatly improved staff assistance to the President, which has contributed importantly to the management of the Government during the trying years of war and of postwar adjustment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the creation of the Executive Office of the President, however, the Congress has further recognized the need for more adequate central staff and created two new important staff agencies to assist the President—the National Security Council and the National Security Resources Board. The primary function of the first of these agencies, as defined by statute, is—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I26" class="indent2 firstIndent-2">  to advise the President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">The function of the second is—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I26" class="indent2 firstIndent-2">  to advise the President concerning the coordination of military, industrial, and civilian mobilization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Within their respective fields these agencies assist the President in developing plans and policies which extend beyond the responsibility of any single department of the Government. In this they play a role similar in character to that of the various units of the Executive Office of the President. In fact, many of the problems with which they deal require close collaboration with the agencies of the Executive Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the principal purpose of the National Security Council and the National Security Resources Board is to advise and assist the President and their work needs to be coordinated to the fullest degree with that of other staff arms of the President, such as the Bureau of the Budget and the Council of Economic Advisers, it is highly desirable that they be incorporated in the Executive Office of the President. The importance of this transfer was recognized by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, which specifically recommended such a change as one of the essential steps in strengthening the staff facilities of the President and improving the over-all management of the executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because of the necessity of coordination with other staff agencies, the National Security Council and the National Security Resources Board are physically located with the Executive Office of the President and I have taken steps to assure close working relations between them and the agencies of the Executive Office. This plan, therefore, will bring their legal status into accord with existing administrative practice. It is not probable that the reorganizations included in the plan will immediately result in reduced expenditures. They will, however, provide a firm foundation for maintaining and furthering the efficient administrative relationships already established, and for assuring that we have provided permanent arrangements vitally necessary to the national security.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The provisions of this reorganization plan shall become effective notwithstanding the status of the Public Roads Administration within the Federal Works Agency or within any other agency immediately prior to the effective date of this reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1949, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan transfers the Public Roads Administration to the Department of Commerce. After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan directly carries out the recommendation of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to the Public Roads Administration. That the Department of Commerce is the appropriate location for the Public Roads Administration in the executive branch is evident from the nature of its functions and the basic purpose of the Department. The Public Roads Administration is primarily engaged in planning and financing the development of the highways which provide the essential facilities for motor transportation throughout the country. Thus, it comes directly within the purpose of the Department of Commerce, as defined by its organic act, which provides:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">It shall be the province and duty of said Department to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce * * * and the transportation facilities of the United States.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In its reorganization proposals the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government adhered to the statutory definition of the functions and role of the Department of Commerce. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Congress likewise were guided by this concept of the Department in transferring to it the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the Inland Waterways Corporation under the Reorganization Act of 1939. A careful review of the structure of the executive branch reveals no other department or agency in which the Public Roads Administration can so appropriately be located.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The desirability of this transfer of the Public Roads Administration is further emphasized by its relation to the Federal Property and Administrative Services bill now pending in the Senate. This bill creates a new General Services Administration and concentrates in it the principal central administrative service programs of the executive branch. The bill also revises the basic legislation on property management. It has been passed by the House of Representatives by an overwhelming vote and unanimously reported by the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments and awaits final action on the floor of the Senate. This measure substantially conforms to recommendations which I submitted to the Congress more than a year ago and to proposals more recently presented by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, with which I concur. The enactment of this bill will constitute an important step in increasing the efficiency of Federal administration. Since the bill makes permanent provision for the disposal of surplus property, now handled by the War Assets Administration which will expire by law on June 30, early enactment is vital.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In establishing the General Services Administration the Federal Property and Administrative Services bill transfers to the Administration all of the functions and units of the Federal Works Agency. Part of these functions relating to the housing of the governmental establishment clearly fall within the purpose of such an Administration. Certain other functions of the Federal Works Agency, however, bear very little real relation to the objectives of the General Services Administration. The congressional committees which have dealt with the bill have frankly indicated that further consideration must be given to the proper location of some of the programs of the Federal Works Agency. The sooner these unrelated programs can be removed from the new agency, the sooner it can concentrate its efforts upon improving administrative services throughout the executive branch and make the contribution to governmental efficiency for which it has been designed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Principal among the programs of the Federal Works Agency which are unrelated to the General Services Administration are those of the Public Roads Administration. This agency is primarily engaged in the administration of Federal grants to States for highway purposes rather than in the performance of services for other Federal agencies. Its functions, therefore, do not fall within the field of activities of the General Services Administration. Their inclusion cannot but complicate and impede the development of the General Services Administration in the performance of its intended purpose. This reorganization plan will eliminate such a difficulty.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the Public Roads Administration will be transferred bodily from one major agency to another, it is not to be expected that this reorganization will directly result in any appreciable reduction in its expenditures at this time. However, the plan will make for better organization and direction of Federal programs relating to transportation. Assuming the early enactment of the Federal Property and Administrative Services bill, the plan will also materially simplify the development of the proposed General Services Administration and thereby facilitate improvements in the efficiency of administrative services throughout the Government.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of an Administrative Assistant Secretary of Labor.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that the reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There are several laws regulating wages and hours of workers employed on Federal contracts for public works or construction. The “eight hour laws” limit the employment of laborers and mechanics on such projects to 8 hours per day and permit their employment in excess of that limit only upon condition that time and one-half the basic-wage rate is paid for the excess hours. The Davis-Bacon Act provides that the minimum rates of pay for laborers and mechanics on certain Federal public-works contracts shall be those prevailing for the corresponding classes of workers in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor. The Copeland anti-kick-back law prohibits the exaction of rebates or kick-backs from workers employed on the construction of Federal public works or works financed by the Federal Government and authorizes the Secretary of Labor to make regulations for contractors engaged on such projects.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to the above statutes, there are several acts which require the payment of prevailing-wage rates, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, to laborers and mechanics employed on construction financed in whole or in part by loans or grants from the Federal Government or by mortgages guaranteed by the Federal Government. These acts are: the National Housing Act, the Housing Act of 1949, the Federal Airport Act, and the Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With the exception of the Department of Labor, the Federal agencies involved in the administration of the various acts are divided into two classes: (1) agencies which contract for Federal public works or construction; and (2) agencies which lend or grant Federal funds, or act as guarantors of mortgages, to aid in the construction of projects to be built by State or local public agencies or private individuals and groups. The methods of enforcing labor standards necessarily differ between these two groups of agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The methods adopted by the various agencies for the enforcement of labor standards vary widely in character and effectiveness. As a result, uniformity of enforcement is lacking and the degree of protection afforded workers varies from agency to agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to correct this situation, this plan authorizes the Secretary of Labor to coordinate the administration of legislation relating to wages and hours on federally financed or assisted projects by prescribing standards, regulations, and procedures to govern the enforcement activities of the various Federal agencies and by making such investigations as he deems desirable to assure consistent enforcement. The actual performance of enforcement activities, normally including the investigation of complaints of violations, will remain the duty of the respective agencies awarding the contracts or providing the Federal assistance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the principal objective of the plan is more effective enforcement of labor standards, it is not probable that it will result in savings. But it will provide more uniform and more adequate protection for workers through the expenditures made for the enforcement of the existing legislation.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 15 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers the functions of the General Services Administration relating to public works in Alaska and in the Virgin Islands to the Department of the Interior. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 15 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The savings to be realized from the transfers provided for in the plan cannot be predicted in detail at this time. The small size and restricted character of the Virgin Islands public-works program will prevent large reductions in administrative expenditures. However, by placing the responsibility for the activity in the Department generally concerned with the government and welfare of the islands, the plan will lead to a closer integration of the public-works program with verified needs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Alaska public-works program is new and will continue to grow for some time. As a result the over-all costs of administration will increase under any organizational arrangements which may be established. The concentration of responsibility in the Department already charged with the execution of related programs in Alaska and required by law to approve all projects constructed under the Alaska Public Works Act of 1949 should, however, simplify relationships and lead to more economical administration than would otherwise be possible.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 16 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Federal Security Agency the functions of the General Services Administration relating to assistance to local school districts and grants and loans for water-pollution-control projects.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer of the responsibility for making payments to local school districts whose operating deficits are due in part to Federal activities is unlikely to result in an immediate reduction in expenditures for the administration of the program. However, by placing the function in the agency of the Government best informed in matters of public-school administration and presently charged with the payment of other grants for educational purposes, the plan will provide additional assurance that the funds appropriated for assistance to overburdened school districts will be most advantageously expended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The relative newness and expanding character of the water-pollution-control program prevents the itemization of the reductions in expenditures which will follow the consolidation of responsibility for this activity. It is expected that the elimination of overlapping and the simplification of relationships which will result from the transfer will make it possible to administer grants and loans more expeditiously and at lower costs per project than can be done under the present division of responsibility.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The first of the transfers provided for by this plan will result in the more economical administration of those activities of the Federal Government which are concerned with the over-all planning and development of communities. The concentration of responsibility in a single agency will make it possible to so integrate administration as to avoid duplication of technical staffs and to simplify relationships with State and local agencies. Moreover, by reducing the likelihood that the two programs involved will be administered at cross-purposes or in conflict with each other, it can be expected that the money expended will achieve greater benefits than would be likely under the present distribution of responsibility. It is not, however, possible to itemize the reduction in expenditures which will result, chiefly because both programs are of recent origin and are still undergoing expansion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer of the war public works functions will lead to modest savings by consolidating the responsibility for the management and disposal of all properties built or acquired under the Lanham Act of 1940, as amended, in the Agency which already has the greater part of the total job. The fact that it will become possible to manage and dispose of public facilities serving emergency housing developments without the interagency negotiation which is now necessary will lead to economies, although they cannot be itemized or predicted with exactness.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The provisions of this reorganization plan shall take effect on the 1st day of July, 1950.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 18 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services the functions of the various Federal agencies with respect to leasing and assigning general-purpose space in buildings and the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings. Since such authority is already largely concentrated in the General Services Administration with respect to the District of Columbia, the plan principally relates to the administration of these functions in the field.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfers made by this plan will promote more economical leasing, better utilization of building space, and more efficient operation of Government-controlled office buildings. They will effectuate the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government with respect to concentrating in the General Services Administration the responsibility for space allotment and the operation of Government buildings outside of the District of Columbia. Likewise, they will extend the principles laid down by the Congress in enacting the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to another important area of Government-wide administrative services—the administration of Government office buildings and general-purpose building space in the field.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Within the District of Columbia, one agency, the Public Buildings Service of the General Services Administration, has long had the operation and custody of most Government buildings and the leasing and assignment of space for executive agencies. Thus, nearly all requests for building space are handled by a single organization which is responsible for seeing that agencies are properly and efficiently housed. This arrangement has proved its worth and has repeatedly been approved by the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Outside of the National Capital, however, responsibility for the acquisition and control of building space and the operation of Government buildings is widely diffused. A variety of agencies operate and control general-purpose buildings. If quarters are not available in Federal buildings, each agency ordinarily does its own leasing. As a result, in some cases Federal agencies have contracted for space at high rentals at the very time that other agencies have been giving up surplus low-cost space.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The assignment of space in Government-owned buildings outside of Washington is also divided among a number of agencies. While the Public Buildings Service constructs a large part of the Government buildings, it operates and controls the assignment of space in only a small proportion of them. The Post Office Department operates and allocates the space in post-office buildings, several hundred of which contain substantial amounts of office space available for other agencies. During and immediately after the war several other Federal agencies acquired office buildings in the field. As their activities have contracted, surplus space in many of these structures has become available for other uses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan concentrates in the General Services Administration the responsibility for the leasing and assignment of what is termed general-purpose building space; that is, space which is suitable for the uses of a number of Federal agencies. It specifically excludes space in buildings at military posts, arsenals, navy yards, and similar defense installations and space in hospitals, laboratories, factories, and other special-purpose buildings.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Also, the plan excludes the Post Office Department from the transfer of leasing authority since the Department has a highly developed organization for this purpose, and it limits the transfer of space assignment authority in post-office buildings to the space not occupied by the Department. Further, it gives the needs of the Post Office Department priority in the assignment of space in post-office buildings. Thus, the plan amply safeguards the interests of the Post Office Department while making it possible to include the general office space in post-office buildings in any given city with other similar space under Federal control in planning and executing an efficient program for housing Government agencies in that area.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition, the plan transfers to the General Services Administration the operation, maintenance, and custody of office buildings owned or leased by the Government, including those post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will make it possible to establish a single organization for the operation and maintenance of Government office buildings in principal cities in the field as has proved desirable in the National Capital. Since many post offices are in fact primarily large office buildings, the plan includes in this transfer the post-office buildings which are not used predominantly for post-office purposes. This will relieve the Post Office Department of a considerable expenditure for building operation and maintenance which properly should not be charged against postal revenues.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While the plan effects a broad transfer of functions with respect to leasing and assignment of space and the operation and maintenance of office buildings, it specifically authorizes the Administrator of General Services to delegate the performance of any part of these functions to other agencies subject to such regulations as he deems desirable for economical and effective administration. In this the plan follows the pattern adopted by the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 for other branches of property management. In large urban centers where numerous Federal units are located unified administration of space activities by the General Services Administration will normally be advantageous. On the other hand, in the smaller communities it will no doubt be desirable to delegate the work back to the agencies directly affected, to be carried on under standards laid down by the Administrator of General Services. The plan provides ample flexibility for working out the most effective administrative arrangement for each type of situation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The fundamental soundness and economy of centralized administration of building space have been amply demonstrated in the National Capital. By virtue of unified control it has been possible since the war to accomplish far-reaching changes which have consolidated agencies in much fewer locations, released many of the rented buildings, and greatly reduced the cost of housing the Government establishment. Similar procedures applied in the larger centers of field activity should produce substantial savings.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found, and hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While it is not possible at this time to calculate the reduction in expenditures which will result from this plan, it can safely be predicted that it will produce substantial savings. I am confident that this reorganization plan will constitute a significant improvement in Federal business practice and will bring about an important increase in efficiency in housing Government agencies.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There are hereby transferred to the General Services Administration, to be used, employed, and expended in connection with the functions transferred by the provisions of this reorganization plan, the records and property now being used or held in connection with such functions, the personnel employed in connection with such functions, and the unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds available or to be made available for use in connection with such functions. Such further measures and dispositions as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall determine to be necessary in order to effectuate the transfers provided for in this section shall be carried out in such manner as the Director shall direct and by such agencies as he shall designate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 20 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan transfers from the Secretary of State to the Administrator of General Services a number of functions which have no connection with foreign affairs but bear a close relation to the archival and records functions of the General Services Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since its establishment in 1789 the Department of State has performed certain routine secretarial and recordkeeping functions for the Federal Government which are entirely extraneous to its basic mission with respect to the conduct of foreign relations. While these activities do not properly belong in the Department, they were assigned to it and continued under its jurisdiction for want of an appropriate agency for their performance. At present these functions consist of the preservation and publication of laws, the preparation and publication of the Statutes at Large, the certification and publication of constitutional amendments, the receipt and preservation of certificates of Presidential electors and of electoral votes, and the compilation and publication of Territorial papers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Through the National Archives and Records Service the General Services Administration is especially staffed and equipped for the conduct of activities of these types. It is the principal custodian of the official records of the Government. Under the Federal Register Act and the Administrative Procedure Act, it preserves and publishes in the Federal Register the Executive orders, proclamations, and other principal executive documents and it codifies and publishes the rules and regulations promulgated by the various departments and agencies. This work is generally similar in nature to, and much greater in volume than, that performed by the Department of State with respect to constitutional amendments, laws, and proclamations. Consequently, the consolidation of these activities of the State Department with the archival and records activities of the General Services Administration should make for greater efficiency and economy. The plan, however, does not transfer the custody and publication of treaties and international agreements, since they are matters of special concern to the Department of State and it is the agency most competent to edit such documents.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The handling of the certificates of Presidential electors and the compilation and publication of Territorial papers also more appropriately belong in the General Services Administration. The first is largely a matter of record keeping and the second of archival research. The preparation of the Territorial papers involves the compilation and editing of official documents of the various Territories formerly existing within the United States. The greater part of this material is now in the National Archives and the work involved is generally similar to that being performed by it with respect to other groups of public records.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition, the plan abolishes two statutory duties of the Secretary of State which have become obsolete. The first is the duty of procuring copies of all State statutes as provided in the act of <date date="1789-09-23">September 23, 1789</date> (R.S. 206). Inasmuch as the Library of Congress now has a complete collection of the State laws, it is no longer necessary for the Department of State to maintain a complete collection. The second is the requirement, imposed by the act of <date date="1876-07-31">July 31, 1876</date> (<ref href="/us/stat/19/105">19 Stat. 105</ref>), as amended, that the Secretary of State publish proclamations and treaties in a newspaper in the District of Columbia. This is now unnecessary since proclamations are published in the Federal Register and treaties are made available currently in slip form in the Treaties and Other International Acts Series.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in this plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfers provided by this plan will relieve the State Department of a number of functions that have no relation to its primary purpose and place them in an agency especially designed for the performance of such activities. Until these functions are incorporated in the operations of the General Services Administration, it will not, of course, be practicable to determine the economies attributable to their transfer, but it is reasonable to expect modest yet worth-while savings to be achieved.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. This plan effects a basic reorganization of the functions of the United States Maritime Commission along the lines recommended by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Within the last 3 years three different bodies have studied the administration of the Maritime Commission. All have concluded that the operating deficiencies of the agency arise from inappropriate and unsound organization and that a fundamental reorganization is essential. The first of these bodies, the President’s Advisory Committee on the Merchant Marine, in 1947, stated:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">It appears to the Committee that the organization structure of the Maritime Commission as set up in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is wholly inadequate for the efficient conduct of the multitude of diverse activities for which the Maritime Commission is now responsible. The deficiencies of the statutory organization for administrative action are regarded by the Committee to be the most serious obstacle standing in the way of the development of the Merchant Marine of this country.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">Similarly, the survey of the Maritime Commission in 1948 for the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments concluded that—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">The fundamental weakness of the Maritime Commission, as it is now constituted, lies in its proscribed organization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">On the basis of investigations of the Maritime Commission by two of its task forces, the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch stated:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">It is an anomaly that a regulatory commission should also conduct the executive function of managing a huge business; that executive functions should be carried on by an agency that is not subject to Presidential directions; that executive functions should be carried on by a full-time board * * *.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While the recommendations of the various studies differ in some details, they agree on principles and on the main features of reorganization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Basically, the administrative difficulties of the Maritime Commission have arisen, as all these studies agree, from the fact that the Commission is responsible for performing two fundamentally different types of functions which call for different types of organization. These two classes of functions are (a) regulatory and (b) operating and promotional. Under various acts the Commission regulates rates and services of water carriers; passes on agreements among carriers; and protects shippers against unfair and discriminatory practices. This type of activity requires the deliberation and independence of judgment which a board or commission is especially well designed to provide. But at the same time the Commission is charged with the conduct of a variety of large and costly promotional and business-type programs demanding the prompt and vigorous administration for which experience both in Government and in private enterprise has demonstrated that a single executive is essential.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Maritime Commission has charge of the construction of merchant vessels for subsidized operators and for Government account. It owns and maintains the largest merchant fleet in the world, consisting of 2,200 vessels aggregating more than 22,000,000 dead-weight tons. It charters and sells ships and, in time of war or national emergency, requisitions and operates vessels for the Government. It grants construction and operating differential subsidies to private shipping companies to maintain an active privately operated American merchant marine. It makes loans and insures mortgages to assist carriers in acquiring new vessels, and it conducts programs for training officers and seamen for the merchant marine. For the present fiscal year the performance of these functions will involve the expenditure of approximately $162,000,000 and the direction of an organization of 5,500 employees. In short, the administration of the Maritime Commission is a vast business undertaking. Moreover, the work of the Commission affects significantly the interests of both business and labor in the maintenance of a sound maritime industry.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Further than this, many of the activities of the Maritime Commission are closely related to other programs of the Government and have to be coordinated with them. In the construction of a subsidized ship the Commission must cooperate with the Coast Guard on those features of design, materials, and equipment which affect the safety of the vessel and with the Navy on those which especially affect the use of the ship for national defense. Furthermore, the whole program of subsidized ship construction needs to be adjusted to the plans and requirements for national defense. At the same time the Commission’s programs for the development of the merchant marine must be coordinated with our foreign policy and with Federal programs with respect to other branches of transportation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While an independent commission is an appropriate instrument for the performance of the regulatory functions of the Maritime Commission, such an agency obviously is not the type required to provide strong and efficient administration of the large operating programs now entrusted to the Commission or to obtain the needed coordination with other activities of the executive branch. This fact is amply demonstrated by the administrative difficulties and the complicated problems of coordination encountered in the operation of the Commission since the war and by the necessity of transferring a large part of its functions to the War Shipping Administration, headed by a single executive, during the war.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Briefly, this reorganization plan provides for a small Federal Maritime Board and a Maritime Administration in the Department of Commerce to perform the functions of the Maritime Commission, and abolishes the existing Commission. It transfers to the Board the regulatory functions of the Commission and definitely guarantees the independence of the Board in the performance of these functions. In addition, it vests directly in the Board the determination and award of construction and operating differential subsidies. In the performance of its subsidy functions the Board will be subject to general policy guidance by the Secretary of Commerce. The Board, however, and it alone, will determine to whom subsidies shall be granted and will make and award the subsidy contracts. Its actions therein will be conclusive and will not be subject to modification by any other agency or officer of the Department of Commerce. The other functions of the Maritime Commission, including carrying out the subsidy agreements made by the Board and administering the various operating programs, are transferred to the Secretary of Commerce for administration through the Maritime Administration. Thus, the plan provides for each of the two types of functions now vested in the Maritime Commission the type of organization best suited to its performance. At the same time, the plan will facilitate coordination of maritime policies and programs with other related policies and programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The division of functions under this plan conforms directly to the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government. While the award of subsidies is a promotional rather than a regulatory function and might logically be assigned to the Maritime Administration instead of the Board, its impact on the shipping industry and on individual carriers is such as to make desirable the deliberation and combined judgment of a board. Accordingly, I have adhered to the recommendation of the Commission on Organization that this function be vested in a multiple body rather than a single official. Likewise, in line with the recommendations of the Commission, the plan assigns the determination of the over-all route pattern to the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Maritime Board will consist of three members appointed by the President with the consent of the Senate for overlapping terms of 4 years. Not more than two of the members can be of the same political party. The Board, therefore, will be a smaller and more wieldy body which can function with greater expedition and efficiency than the existing five-member Commission. The Chairman will be designated by the President from the members of the Board and will be, ex officio, the Maritime Administrator and as such the head of the Maritime Administration. The plan also provides for a Deputy Maritime Administrator appointed by the Secretary of Commerce under the classified civil service. After investigation I have found, and hereby declare, that by reason of the reorganizations made by this plan, it is necessary to include in the plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the members of the Federal Maritime Board and for the appointment of the Deputy Maritime Administrator.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In making the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Board the Maritime Administrator, the plan adopts an arrangement substantially similar to that which prevailed during the war, when the same individual served as Chairman of the Maritime Commission and head of the War Shipping Administration. This arrangement will have important advantages. It will facilitate cooperation between the Board and the Administration on matters of concern to both. Also, it will avoid dividing the personnel of the Maritime Commission, since the Chairman of the Board will supervise the personnel assisting it in the performance of its functions, as is now the case in the Maritime Commission, and in his capacity as Administrator he will have charge of the personnel carrying on the work of the Maritime Administration. The plan provides for the joint operation of the officers and employees under the Administrator and Chairman as a single body of personnel. The maintenance of a unified staff is essential for efficient and economical administration because many of the technical and professional personnel, such as ship designers and attorneys, now assist the Maritime Commission on problems of subsidy determination and also participate in the subsequent administration of subsidy agreements and in performing nonsubsidy functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The inclusion of the new Board in the Department of Commerce will permit the use of the administrative services of the Department. More important, it will eliminate the necessity of splitting the personnel of the Maritime Commission between the Department and an outside agency. In addition, it will relieve the President of having to handle relations with a separate maritime agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In establishing the Department of Commerce the Congress provided in the organic act of the Department that—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I23" class="indent2">It shall be the province and duty of said Department to foster, promote, and develop the foreign and domestic commerce, * * * shipping, * * * and the transportation facilities of the United States.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">Over the years, however, transportation functions have become widely scattered throughout the executive branch. As a result, intelligent planning and budgeting of Federal transportation activities and the necessary coordination of transportation programs have become extremely difficult or impossible. The transfer of the functions of the Maritime Commission to the Department of Commerce will constitute a major step in correcting this condition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Without question the Department of Commerce is now the appropriate center for transportation programs. It contains the Civil Aeronautics Administration—the major operating and promotional agency of the Government in the field of air transportation—and the Weather Bureau, and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which provide vital services to transportation. As a result of Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1949, it now also includes the Bureau of Public Roads, the leading promotional agency dealing with land transportation. Also, it has the Inland Waterways Corporation in the field of water transportation. The transfer of the functions of the Maritime Commission will bring into the Department the principal water-transportation agency of the Government. These actions will go a long way toward the establishment of a sound and effective organization for the operating and promotional programs of the Government relating to transportation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is my purpose to look to the Secretary of Commerce for leadership with respect to transportation problems and for the development of over-all transportation policy within the executive branch. Because of the magnitude and importance of the transportation functions transferred to the Department of Commerce by this reorganization plan, I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to strengthen the top administrative structure of the Department by providing for the appointment and compensation of a new Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation. This will make available an officer of the highest rank to assist the Secretary in supervising the varied and complex transportation programs of the Department and providing central leadership in transportation matters. With the many responsibilities of the Secretary of Commerce in other areas, the creation of this office is essential to enable him properly to fulfill his obligations with respect to transportation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After careful investigation I have found and I hereby declare that each of the reorganizations contained in this reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The rates of compensation fixed by the provisions of the reorganization plan for the Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation, the Chairman, and the other two members of the Federal Maritime Board are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In summary, the reorganizations provided by this plan will have the following principal advantages: They will provide an efficient organization headed by a single responsible official to administer the large operating and business-type programs of the Maritime Commission. At the same time, they will preserve the benefits of a bipartisan board for the performance of the regulatory functions of the Commission and the determination of subsidies. They will reduce the number of agencies reporting directly to the President and simplify the over-all management of the executive branch. In doing so, they will provide more adequate machinery for supervising the administration of the maritime programs and will facilitate their coordination with related policies and programs of the executive branch. Finally, they will accomplish a major advance in the development of an effective organization of Federal transportation programs in accord with the recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government. While it is impossible to estimate in advance the savings which will be brought about by this plan, the improvements in administrative efficiency resulting from it should produce substantial reductions in expenditures for the programs transferred by the plan.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 22 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan improves the grouping of Government programs according to their major purposes by transferring the Federal National Mortgage Association from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Housing and Home Finance Agency. This reorganization carries out the specific recommendation of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government that “The Federal National Mortgage Association be placed under the Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At present, the Federal National Mortgage Association, a wholly owned Government corporation, is a subsidiary of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Its purpose is to provide a secondary market for home mortgages insured or guaranteed by other Government agencies through the purchase, service, and sale of such mortgages. In addition, it is authorized to make direct loans for housing in Alaska. As of the end of March 1950 its total holdings were approximately a billion dollars and its outstanding commitments to purchase were more than $1,400,000,000 in addition. Such a volume of activity has an obvious impact on the Government’s entire housing program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Congress has long recognized that the function of such a secondary mortgage market is closely related to the entire housing program. The Federal National Mortgage Association originally was chartered by the head of the Federal Housing Administration as authorized by title III of the National Housing Act. In rechartering the Federal National Mortgage Association 2 years ago the Congress recognized the relationship between it and the operations of the Housing and Home Finance Agency by providing that the Federal Housing Commissioner alone would have authority to determine whether and when the Federal National Mortgage Association should be terminated. This act also required submission of semiannual reports to the Federal Housing Commissioner and for the transmittal by him of these reports to the Congress together with his recommendations thereon.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Nearly 3 years ago the Congress approved the establishment of the Housing and Home Finance Agency under an Administrator who could be held responsible by the President and the Congress for the general coordination and supervision of Federal housing programs placed in the Housing Agency at that time. The Federal National Mortgage Association was not then made a part of the Housing Agency because the provisions of section 5(e) of the reorganization act then in effect precluded submission of plans involving agencies whose organizational status had been changed by the Congress subsequent to <date date="1945-01-01">January 1, 1945</date>. The act of <date date="1945-02-24">February 24, 1945</date>, transferred the Federal Loan Agency, which included the Federal National Mortgage Association, from the Department of Commerce. Moreover, the holdings of the Federal National Mortgage Association amounted to only $7,500,000. This small volume of operation presented few immediate problems of coordination with other aspects of the entire housing program. However, the basic relationship of the Federal National Mortgage Association to the housing program was recognized by making the chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, or his designee, a member of the National Housing Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present high volume of activity by the Federal National Mortgage Association has radically altered the situation which existed in 1947 and has made it essential that these market operations be geared more closely into the Government’s housing program. The manner in which these market operations are administered has a direct effect on the kind of mortgages written and the availability and cost of mortgage credit. The secondary market must be administered, therefore, at all times in full consistency with other programs affecting housing credit.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Government seeks to accomplish the objectives of its housing program through the use of several methods. The purchase and sale of home mortgages in the secondary market by the Federal National Mortgage Association is merely one of such methods. Others include the insurance of home mortgages and improvement loans, insurance of shares of savings and loan associations, and loans and grants to local public agencies for the purpose of financing low-rent housing projects and slum clearance. All of these methods are means whereby the objectives of the housing program are achieved and should be the responsibility of the agency charged with that program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer of the Federal National Mortgage Association will not prevent the Reconstruction Finance Corporation from making loans to business enterprises on the security of real estate, or from accepting mortgages as collateral in connection with a business loan. This type of activity is consistent with normal business lending functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer of the Federal National Mortgage Association to the Housing and Home Finance Agency will assure the necessary coordination of its operations with other housing programs, thus providing a sounder basis for future progress toward a better-housed America. It is not probable that the reorganization in this plan will immediately result in reduced expenses, but in view of the relationship to other programs of housing aids, a more consistent approach in carrying out such policies will be possible and should result in long-term economies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found, and I hereby declare, that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 22 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In view of the direct relation of the Federal National Mortgage Association to other housing finance programs, which was initially recognized by the Congress and only last year reiterated by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, I recommend that the Congress grant its approval to the transfer provided in this reorganization plan.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 23 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan further promotes the grouping of Government programs according to their major purposes by transferring from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Housing and Home Finance Agency the lending functions of the Government with respect to the production and distribution of prefabricated houses and components. This reorganization would be consistent with the objective set by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government which recommended that “all housing activities be placed in one agency under a single administrator.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under its general powers pursuant to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, and pursuant to the Veterans’ Emergency Housing Act of 1946, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has made a number of loans to finance the production, distribution, and marketing of prefabricated houses and components. In addition, under section 102 of the Housing Act of 1948, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is specifically authorized to make loans, not exceeding $50,000,000 outstanding at any one time, to finance the production of such housing. The greater portion of the loans so authorized have been made and are now outstanding.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The development of an efficient prefabricated housing industry is an essential part of the total housing program. It, therefore, requires integration with the major housing activities of the Federal Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Moreover, the functions to be transferred from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation are complementary to other activities of the Housing and Home Finance Agency in the field of manufactured housing. The Agency has under way considerable research on this type of housing construction. Under the National Housing Act, the Federal Housing Administration, a constituent agency, insures loans for the manufacture of such housing as well as mortgages on such houses when erected and sold. Thus, the successful operation of the program of loans for the manufacture of prefabricated houses depends, to a large extent, on the ready availability of mortgage insurance by the Federal Housing Administration as the primary means of assuring permanent financing for their sale.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Federal Housing Administration also insures mortgages on rental housing developments to serve military installations under title VIII of the National Housing Act, as amended, the so-called Military Housing Act. The Congress recently has recognized the place of prefabricated houses in this program by amending the law to make it clear that the Department of Defense should use prefabricated housing which conforms to standards established by the Federal Housing Administration wherever it is feasible to do so. The development of a strong, expansible prefabricated housing industry also is essential for rapidly meeting any emergency housing needs of the country. The Housing and Home Finance Agency, in cooperation with the National Security Resources Board, should be in a position to encourage peacetime uses of prefabricated housing readily adaptable to potential emergency requirements of the future.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer by this reorganization plan of the functions, loans, and unused authorizations of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation with respect to prefabricated housing will place most of the Government functions concerning such housing in the Housing and Home Finance Agency. This will make possible greater consistency between governmental assistance available for the production or manufacture of prefabricated houses with governmental assistance available for the distribution, erection, and marketing of such housing. It will also assure coordination and integration of the prefabricated housing functions with other programs within the Housing and Home Finance Agency and thus materially assist in carrying out the national housing policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization may not result in substantial immediate savings, although benefits should be achieved through improved operations which will result in economies over a period of time. An itemization of these economies in advance of actual experience is not practicable.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found, and I hereby declare, that each reorganization contained in Reorganization Plan No. 23 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">NATIONAL SECURITY RESOURCES BOARD</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Section 1. Functions of Chairman and of Board</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions of the National Security Resources Board are hereby transferred to the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board, and the Board shall hereafter advise and consult with the Chairman with respect to such matters within his jurisdiction as he may request.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 2. Vice Chairman</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There is hereby established the office of Vice Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. Such Vice Chairman shall (1) be an additional member of the National Security Resources Board, (2) be appointed from civilian life by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, (3) receive compensation at the rate of $16,000 per annum, and (4) perform such of the duties of the Chairman as the Chairman shall designate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 3. Performance of Functions of Chairman</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Chairman may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, or by any agency or employee, of the National Security Resources Board of any function of the Chairman.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949. The plan transfers the function of the National Security Resources Board from the Board to the Chairman of the Board and makes the Board advisory to the Chairman. The plan also provides for a Vice Chairman, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The function assigned to the National Security Resources Board by the National Security Act of 1947 is “to advise the President concerning the coordination of military, industrial and civilian mobilization.” Proper performance of this function requires action by the Board and its staff in two broad areas:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(1) The conduct of advance mobilization planning which identifies the problems which will arise and the measures necessary to meet these problems if and when the Nation moves from a peacetime into a wartime situation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(2) The formulation of current policies and programs which will help the Nation achieve an adequate state of readiness against the eventuality of a future war.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The role assigned the National Security Resources Board is clearly one of staff assistance to the President. The Congress recently recognized this fact in its approval of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1949 which, pursuant to the specific recommendation of the Hoover Commission, placed the National Security Resources Board in the Executive Office of the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The accompanying reorganization plan is designed to make the National Security Resources Board a more effective instrument. Successful performance of the Board’s mission requires a wide range of detailed study and analysis to cover all the major aspects of national mobilization. A committee of department heads or departmental representatives encounters some natural difficulties in providing supervision and leadership in such an extensive and detailed activity. The Chairman has the difficult task of exercising discretion as to which matters shall be submitted for Board approval. The departmental members of the Board cannot possibly supervise or approve the Board’s extensive and detailed activities and yet, as Board members, must accept ultimate responsibility for all such activities. Likewise, the departmental members are encumbered by the difficulty of having to reach collective and speedy decisions on a great many matters for which they, as Board members, are responsible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By vesting the functions of the Board in the Chairman, the difficulties of Board operation will be overcome. At the same time, the reorganization plan provides for the continued participation of the several departments and agencies in the task of mobilization planning. This is not only a matter of established policy but also a requirement of the National Security Act. The departments will continue to have representation on the Board. The Board, in an advisory relationship to the Chairman, will be a useful arrangement for obtaining the necessary participation of departments in mobilization planning and for coordination of their activity. It will enable the departments to keep abreast of the total range of security resources planning. Without reliance on the departments for the execution of much of the actual job of mobilization planning, coordination with the total range of governmental policies and objectives would be lost.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Congress in passing the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 recognized the difficulty which exists when functions of staff advice and assistance are placed in a board-type agency. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949, in clarifying the role of the Chairman of the Munitions Board and the Research and Development Board, strengthened and increased the effectiveness of these staff agencies of the Secretary of Defense by providing for the exclusive exercise of responsibilities by the Chairman. This plan achieves the same objective for the National Security Resources Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The accompanying reorganization plan provides for a Vice Chairman appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The tremendous responsibilities of the National Security Resources Board and the heavy workload on the Chairman fully warrant this. Providing the Chairman with a principal associate for the exercise of his responsibilities is consistent with the usual practice in other agencies of the executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Vice Chairman of the National Security Resources Board. The rate of compensation fixed for this officer is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 25 may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, the important objective is maximum effectiveness in security resources planning.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The security of this Nation requires that these steps be taken to enable security resources planning to move forward more effectively. It is for that reason that Reorganization Plan No. 25 is today submitted to the Congress. It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I strongly urge congressional acceptance of Reorganization Plan No. 25.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and effecting reorganizations in the Department of the Treasury. The reorganizations included in this plan are identical with those contained in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1950, except that the functions of the Comptroller of the Currency are unaffected by Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1950 on March 13, I stated that the reorganizations contained therein were essential to clarification of the lines of authority and responsibility in the executive branch. I further emphasized that those reorganizations would put into effect in the Department of the Treasury the principal remaining recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government affecting the location of management responsibility. I urged the Congress to add its approval to my acceptance of these recommendations of the Commission on Organization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On May 11 the Senate disapproved Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1950. The reason for the disapproval was the inclusion of the functions of the Comptroller of the Currency among the responsibilities proposed to be transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury. Accordingly, in order to meet the objection which led to such disapproval and to preserve the major benefits of the disapproved plan, Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 is transmitted herewith.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At the same time that this plan provides strengthened administration for the Corporation, it also provides certain additional safeguards with respect to loan policy and to specific loan applications. Under the reorganization plan, the Loan Policy Board promulgates general policies which shall govern the granting and denial of applications for financial assistance by the Corporation. The reorganization plan likewise includes new provisions for ensuring that all loan applications are handled in accordance with established policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to providing strengthened administration of the Corporation and additional safeguards with respect to loan policy and the approval of specific loan applications, the reorganization plan provides the basis, by virtue of the composition of the Loan Policy Board, for better coordination of the Corporation’s loan policies with other policies, programs, and activities of the Government. The reorganization plan provides that this Board shall have five members, all ex officio. These are the Administrator of the Corporation, the Deputy Administrator, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Commerce, and one additional member to be designated from time to time by the President from among officials of the Government who are required to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The participation of these officials will facilitate the development of loan policies consistent with the requirements of other broad programs of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Especially important is the participation of the Secretary of Commerce who, as head of the Department of Commerce, administers most of the Government programs for nonfinancial aids to business. Giving him a voice on the Loan Policy Board will aid in bringing under common policies the financial aids to business administered by the Corporation and the nonfinancial aids carried on in the Department of Commerce. Government aid to small and independent business should be particularly benefited by the participation of the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Specifically, the provision in the reorganization plan for a financial-assistance procedure governing the processing of applications in excess of $100,000 to any borrower strengthens and gives statutory prescription to an administrative arrangement already existing in the Corporation. In handling such loans under the reorganization plan, applications will be referred for analysis and recommendation to a board of review composed of not less than five employees of the Corporation. Whenever the Administrator approves or denies an application for financial assistance on which a board of review has recommended otherwise, he must set forth, in a memorandum to be placed in the files of the Corporation, the reasons for his action. This procedure is provided in order to assure that all applications for loans involving large sums are fully analyzed by the technical staff of the Corporation and that the recommendations of the staff are fully available to the Administrator when acting finally upon such applications.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan continues the Reconstruction Finance Corporation as a separate corporate entity in the executive branch of the Government. Those functions which are currently performed by the Corporation or any of its agencies or officers pursuant to a delegation or assignment of functions made by the President will be subject to termination or modification of any such delegation by the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1951 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949. I also have found and hereby declare that by reason of these reorganizations it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the Administrator and Deputy Administrator of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers of the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1951 may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, the important objective of achieving the maximum effectiveness in the administration of the Government’s lending programs to aid business will be advanced. Increased effectiveness will in turn produce indirect savings. An itemization of these savings is not practicable.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan is especially important at this time of national emergency. It will strengthen the administration of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and at the same time provide additional safeguards with respect to loan policy and the approval of individual loans. It will make possible the more effective coordination of the Government’s general loan policies. I strongly urge the approval of the reorganization plan as a means of achieving these objectives.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 4. Transfer of Functions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There are transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury the functions, if any, that have been vested by statute in officers, agencies, or employees of the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Department of the Treasury since the effective date of Reorganization Plan Numbered 26 of 1950 (15 F.R. 4935).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for reorganizations in the Bureau of Internal Revenue of the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A comprehensive reorganization of that Bureau is necessary both to increase the efficiency of its operations and to provide better machinery for assuring honest and impartial administration of the internal revenue laws. The reorganization plan transmitted with this message is essential to accomplish the basic changes in the structure of the Bureau of Internal Revenue which are necessary for the kind of comprehensive reorganization that is now required.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By bringing additional personnel in the Bureau of Internal Revenue under the merit system, Reorganization Plan No. 1 likewise removes what the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government described as “one of the chief handicaps to effective organization of the Department * * *.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is my determination to maintain the highest standards of integrity and efficiency in the Federal service. While those standards have been observed faithfully by all but a relatively few public servants, the betrayal of their trust by those few demands the strongest corrective action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The most vigorous efforts are being and will continue to be made to expose and punish every Government employee who misuses his official position. But we must do even more than this. We must correct every defect in organization that contributes to inefficient management and thus affords the opportunity for improper conduct.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The thorough reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue which I propose will be of great help in accomplishing all of these ends. It is an integral part of a program to prevent improper conduct in public service, to protect the Government from insidious influence peddlers and favor seekers, to expose and punish wrong-doers, and to improve the management and efficiency of the executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am confident that the Congress and the public are as deeply and earnestly concerned as I am that the public business be conducted entirely upon a basis of fairness, integrity, and efficiency. I therefore hope that the Congress will give speedy approval to Reorganization Plan No. 1, in order that we may move ahead rapidly in to achieving the reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The task of collecting the internal revenue has expanded enormously within the past decade. This expansion has been occasioned by the necessary additional taxation brought on by World War II and essential post-war programs. In fiscal year 1940, tax collections made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue were slightly over 5⅓ billions of dollars; in 1951, they totaled almost 50½ billions. In 1940, 19 million tax returns were filed; in 1951, 82 million. In 1940, there were 22,000 employees working for the Bureau; in 1951, there were 57,000.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Throughout this tremendous growth, the structure of the revenue-collecting organization has remained substantially unchanged. The present field structure of the Bureau of Internal Revenue is comprised of more than 200 field offices which report directly to Washington. Those 200 offices carry out their functions through more than 2,000 suboffices and posts of duty throughout the country. The Washington office now provides operating supervision, guidance, and control over the principal field offices through 10 separate divisions, thus further adding to the complexities of administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the end of World War II, many procedural improvements have been made in the Bureau’s operations. The use of automatic machines has been greatly increased. The handling of cases has been simplified. One major advance is represented by the recently completed arrangements to expedite criminal prosecutions in tax-fraud cases. In these cases, field representatives of the Bureau of Internal Revenue will make recommendations for criminal prosecutions directly to the Department of Justice. These procedural changes have increased the Bureau’s efficiency and have made it possible for the Bureau to carry its enormously increased workload. However, improvements in procedure cannot meet the need for organizational changes.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Part of the authority necessary to make a comprehensive reorganization was provided in Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950, which was one of several uniform plans giving department heads fuller authority over internal organizations throughout their departments. The studies of the Secretary of the Treasury have culminated since that time in a plan for extensive reorganization and modernization of the Bureau. However, his existing authority is not broad enough to permit him to effectuate all of the basic features of the plan he has developed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The principal barrier to effective organization and administration of the Bureau of Internal Revenue which plan No. 1 removes is the archaic statutory office of collector of internal revenue. Since the collectors are not appointed and cannot be removed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Secretary of the Treasury and since the collectors must accommodate themselves to local political situations, they are not fully responsive to the control of their superiors in the Treasury Department. Residence requirements prevent moving a collector from one collection district to another, either to promote impartiality and fairness or to advance collectors to more important positions. Uncertainties of tenure add to the difficulty of attracting to such offices persons who are well versed in the intricacies of the revenue laws and possessed of broadgaged administrative ability.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is appropriate and desirable that major political offices in the executive branch of the Government be filled by persons who are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. On the other hand, the technical nature of much of the Government’s work today makes it equally appropriate and desirable that positions of other types be in the professional career service. The administration of our internal-revenue laws at the local level calls for positions in the latter category.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Instead of the present organization built around the offices of politically appointed collectors of internal revenue, plan No. 1 will make it possible for the Secretary of the Treasury to establish not to exceed 25 district offices. Each of these offices will be headed by a district commissioner who will be responsible to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and will have full responsibility for administering all internal-revenue activities within a designated area. In addition, all essential collection, enforcement, and appellate functions can be provided for in each local area and under one roof so far as is practicable. It is not proposed to discontinue any essential facilities which now exist in any local areas. Rather, the facilities will be extended and the service to taxpayers improved. These new arrangements should make it possible for the individual taxpayer to conduct his business with the Bureau much more conveniently and expeditiously.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to making possible greatly improved service to the taxpayer, the establishment of the district offices will provide opportunity in the field service of the Bureau of Internal Revenue for the development of high-caliber administrators with experience in all phases of revenue administration. These offices will be the backbone of a modern, streamlined pattern of organization and operations with clear and direct channels of responsibility and supervision from the lowest field office to the Commissioner, and through him to the Secretary of the Treasury. The creation of this new framework of district offices is a necessary step in carrying out the overall reorganization of the Bureau.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Plan No. 1 also makes it possible to provide a new framework of supervisory offices in the headquarters of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Under plan No. 1, the offices of Deputy Commissioner, Special Deputy Commissioner, and Assistant Commissioner are abolished. Three Assistant Commissioners, all in the classified civil service, are authorized, and will be available, to perform such functions as may be assigned to them. The intention of the Secretary of the Treasury under the comprehensive reorganization is to utilize one Assistant Commissioner to assist the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in supervising the operations of the district offices, another Assistant Commissioner to aid in the preparation of technical rulings and decisions, and the third Assistant Commissioner to supervise for the Commissioner the inspection activities of the Bureau.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Two additional advantages will be obtained when the reorganization around this new framework is completed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">First, the strong inspection service which the Secretary is establishing will keep the work of the Bureau under close and continuous observation. Working under the direct control of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, it will be responsible for promptly detecting and investigating any irregularities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, the new pattern of organization will strengthen and clarify lines of responsibility throughout the Bureau, thus simplifying and making more effective and uniform the management control of the organization. This is essential in any effort to provide our principal revenue collection agency the best possible administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to eliminate Presidential appointment and senatorial confirmation with respect to the Assistant General Counsel for the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and in order to provide a method of appointment comparable to that obtaining in the case of other assistant general counsel of the Department of the Treasury, plan No. 1 abolishes that office and provides in lieu thereof a new office of Assistant General Counsel with appointment under the classified civil service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The success of the reorganization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue will to a considerable extent depend upon the ability to attract the best qualified persons to the key positions throughout the Bureau. In order to do so, it is necessary to make provision for more adequate salaries for such key positions. Plan No. 1 establishes in the Bureau of Internal Revenue a maximum of 70 offices with titles determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Those offices are in addition to the offices with specific titles also provided for in plan No. 1 and to any positions established under other authority vested in the Department of the Treasury. The compensation of these officials will be fixed under the Classification Act of 1949, as amended, but without regard to the numerical limitations on positions set forth in section 505 of that act. This provision will enable the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission, or the President, as the case may be, to fix rates of pay for those offices in excess of the rates established in the Classification Act of 1949 for grade GS–15 whenever the standards of the classification laws so permit.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">All organizational changes under plan No. 1 will be put into effect as soon as it is possible to do so without disrupting the continued collection of revenue. Plan No. 1 will in any event be effective in its entirety no later than <date date="1952-12-01">December 1, 1952</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganizations provided for in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952 will make possible many benefits in improved organization and operations which may be expected to produce substantial savings in future years. Those savings should not be expected to be reflected in an immediate reduction in expenditure by the Bureau of Internal Revenue but in an improved service to the public and a more efficient collection of revenue.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It should be emphasized that abolition by plan No. 1 of the offices of collectors and others will in no way prejudice any right or potential right of any taxpayer. The abolition of offices by plan No. 1 will not abolish any rights, privileges, powers, duties, immunities, liabilities, obligations, or other attributes of those offices except as they relate to matters of appointment, tenure, and compensation inconsistent with plan No. 1. Under the Reorganization Act of 1949, all of these attributes of office will attach to the office to which the functions of the abolished office are delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1952 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying Reorganization Plan No. 1, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of the officers specified therein. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are not in excess of those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I cannot emphasize too strongly the importance which should be attached to the reorganization plan that I am now transmitting to the Congress. The fair and efficient administration of the Federal internal-revenue laws is of vital concern to every citizen. All of us have a right to insist that the Bureau of Internal Revenue be provided with the finest organization that can be devised. All of us are entitled to have that organization manned by personnel who get their jobs and keep them solely because of their own integrity and competence. This reorganization plan will be a major step in achieving those objectives.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my message of <date date="1953-02-02">February 2, 1953</date>, I stated that I would send to the Congress a reorganization plan defining a new administrative status for Federal activities in health, education, and social security. This plan carries out that intention by creating a Department of Health, Education, and Welfare as one of the executive departments of the Government and by transferring to it the various units of the Federal Security Agency. The Department will be headed by a Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, who will be assisted by an Under Secretary and two Assistant Secretaries.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The purpose of this plan is to improve the administration of the vital health, education, and social-security functions now being carried on in the Federal Security Agency by giving them departmental rank. Such action is demanded by the importance and magnitude of these functions, which affect the well-being of millions of our citizens. The programs carried on by the Public Health Service include, for example, the conduct and promotion of research into the prevention and cure of such dangerous ailments as cancer and heart disease. The Public Health Service also administers payments to the States for the support of their health services and for urgently needed hospital construction. The Office of Education collects, analyzes, and distributes to school administrators throughout the country information relating to the organization and management of educational systems. Among its other functions is the provision of financial help to school districts burdened by activities of the United States Government. State assistance to the aged, the blind, the totally disabled, and dependent children is heavily supported by grants-in-aid administered through the Social Security Administration. The old-age and survivors insurance system and child development and welfare programs are additional responsibilities of that Administration. Other offices of the Federal Security Agency are responsible for the conduct of Federal vocational rehabilitation programs and for the enforcement of food and drug laws.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There should be an unremitting effort to improve those health, education, and social-security programs which have proved their value. I have already recommended the expansion of the social-security system to cover persons not now protected, the continuation of assistance to school districts whose population has been greatly increased by the expansion of defense activities, and the strengthening of our food and drug laws.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But good intent and high purpose are not enough; all such programs depend for their success upon efficient, responsible administration. I have recently taken action to assure that the Federal Security Administrator’s views are given proper consideration in executive councils by inviting her to attend meetings of the Cabinet. Now the establishment of the new Department provided for in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 will give the needed additional assurance that these matters will receive the full consideration they deserve in the whole operation of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This need has long been recognized. In 1923, President Harding proposed a Department of Education and Welfare, which was also to include health functions. In 1924, the Joint Committee on Reorganization recommended a new department similar to that suggested by President Harding. In 1932, one of President Hoover’s reorganization proposals called for the concentration of health, education, and recreational activities in a single executive department. The President’s Committee on Administrative Management in 1937 recommended the placing of health, education, and social-security functions in a Department of Social Welfare. This recommendation was partially implemented in 1939 by the creation of the Federal Security Agency—by which action the Congress indicated its approval of the grouping of these functions in a single agency. A new department could not be proposed at that time because the Reorganization Act of 1939 prohibited the creation of additional executive departments. In 1949, the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government proposed the creation of a department for social security and education.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present plan will make it possible to give the officials directing the Department titles indicative of their responsibilities and salaries comparable to those received by their counterparts in other executive departments. As the Under Secretary of an executive department, the Secretary’s principal assistant will be better equipped to give leadership in the Department’s organization and management activities, for which he will be primarily responsible. The plan opens the way to further administrative improvement by authorizing the Secretary to centralize services and activities common to the several agencies of the Department. It also establishes a uniform method of appointment for the heads of the three major constituent agencies. At present, the Surgeon General and the Commissioner of Education are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, while the Commissioner for Social Security is appointed by the Federal Security Administrator. Hereafter, all three will be Presidential appointees subject to Senate confirmation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I believe, and this plan reflects my conviction, that these several fields of Federal activity should continue within the framework of a single department. The plan at the same time assures that the Office of Education and the Public Health Service retain the professional and substantive responsibilities vested by law in those agencies or in their heads. The Surgeon General, the Commissioner of Education, and the Commissioner of Social Security will all have direct access to the Secretary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There should be in the Department an Advisory Committee on Education, made up of persons chosen by the Secretary from outside the Federal Government, which would advise the Secretary with respect to the educational programs of the Department. I recommend the enactment of legislation authorizing the defrayal of the expenses of this Committee. The creation of such a Committee as an advisory body to the Secretary will help insure the maintenance of responsibility for the public educational system in State and local governments while preserving the national interest in education through appropriate Federal action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that by reason of these reorganizations, it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the new officers specified in sections 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the reorganization plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although the effecting of the reorganizations provided for in the reorganization plan will not in itself result in immediate savings, the improvement achieved in administration will in the future allow the performance of necessary services at greater savings than present operations would permit. An itemization of these savings in advance of actual experience is not practicable.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganizations in the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 is designed to make it possible for the Secretary of Agriculture to simplify and improve the internal organization of the Department of Agriculture. It is substantially in accord with the recommendations made in 1949 by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With certain exceptions, Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 transfers to the Secretary of Agriculture the functions now vested by law in other officers, and in the agencies and employees, of the Department. It allows the Secretary to authorize any other officer, agency, or employee of the Department to perform any function vested in the Secretary. He is directed to utilize this delegation authority in such a way as to further certain objectives set forth in the reorganization plan. Those objectives are to simplify and make effective the operation of the Department of Agriculture, to place the administration of farm programs close to the State and local levels, and to adapt the administration of the programs of the Department to regional, State, and local conditions. Further, to the extent deemed practicable by the Secretary, he is required to give appropriate advance public notice and to afford appropriate opportunity for interested persons and groups to present to the Department of Agriculture their views on such proposed delegations of the Secretary as involve assignments of major functions or major groups of functions to major constituent organizational units of the Department or their officers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 will permit the establishment of a clearer line of responsibility and authority from the President through the Secretary of Agriculture down to the lowest level of operations in the Department. It will make the Secretary responsible under law for activities within his Department for which he is now in fact held accountable by the President, the Congress, and the public. Also, it will enable the Secretary, from time to time, to adjust the organization of the Department in order to achieve continuous improvement in operations to meet changing conditions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Congress has in the past repeatedly followed the sound policy of vesting functions directly in department heads so that they can be held accountable for the performance of their agencies. In acting upon recommendations of the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, the Congress approved, in 1949 and 1950, a series of statutes and reorganization plans which applied that policy to all the executive departments except the Department of Defense and the Department of Agriculture. While some laws vest important functions directly in the Secretary of Agriculture, others place major functions in subordinate officers and agencies of the Department. By transferring to the Secretary the latter functions, with certain exceptions, the reorganization plan corrects the present patchwork assignment of statutory functions in the Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions excepted from transfer to the Secretary are the functions of hearing examiners under the Administrative Procedure Act; of the corporations of the Department, including their boards of directors and officers; of the Advisory Board of the Commodity Credit Corporation; and of the Farm Credit Administration and the banks, corporations, and associations supervised by it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The exception of the hearing examiners is in accordance with the intent of the Administrative Procedure Act, and is consistent with the status of hearing examiners in other departments and agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The corporations of the Department, together with their boards of directors and officers, are excepted because they have a different legal status than other constituent agencies of the Department. Bodies corporate have independent legal personalities and act in their own name rather than in the name of the Department of Agriculture or of the United States.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The same reasons which prompt the exception of the corporations of the Department make desirable the exception of the entities supervised by the Farm Credit Administration. The Farm Credit Administration itself is also excepted, since it is anticipated that general legislation covering this field will be recommended to the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of Agriculture now has only one Assistant Secretary. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 provides the Secretary with two more Assistant Secretaries and an Administrative Assistant Secretary to aid him in supervising the Department. The Assistant Secretaries will be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Administrative Assistant Secretary will be appointed under the classified civil service by the Secretary, with the approval of the President. These methods of appointment are similar to those prevailing in other executive departments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Secretary will prescribe the functions to be performed by these new assistants. It is his intention to have the new Assistant Secretaries aid him in providing closer policy and program supervision over the Department of Agriculture, and to have the new Administrative Assistant Secretary perform substantially the same role as that performed by the administrative assistant secretaries in other departments. Thus, the new officers will assist the Secretary in giving continuous attention to matters which are essential for the most efficient and economical operation of the Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Secretary of Agriculture has advised me that the 2 new offices of Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, and the 1 new office of Administrative Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, provided for in the reorganization plan, will merely replace existing positions in the Department, and that hence the creation of these offices will not result in any net increase in the personnel in the Department of Agriculture. He has further advised me that both the number of officers and employees in the Office of the Secretary and the aggregate of their salaries will be less than those existing prior to <date date="1953-01-01">January 1, 1953</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Secretary of Agriculture, aided by the Interim Agricultural Advisory Committee, has been studying the organization and functions of the Department of Agriculture. Recently the Secretary rearranged the organizational units of the Department so as to form (in addition to the Office of the Solicitor and a reorganized Foreign Agricultural Service) four major groups of agencies, each with a supervising head to whom the agencies within the group report. By so doing, the Secretary sought both to reduce the number of separate officials reporting to him and to improve coordination within the Department. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 will make it possible for the Secretary to make further internal adjustments within the Department as study and experience identify opportunities for improvement. It will thus further the better management of the affairs of the Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of two Assistant Secretaries of Agriculture and an Administrative Assistant Secretary of Agriculture. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reductions in expenditures will result from reorganizations of the Department of Agriculture made possible by the taking effect of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953, but such reductions cannot be itemized at this time.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the accompanying reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan is designed to achieve two primary objectives: The first is to improve the organization of the Executive Office of the President; the second is to enable one Executive Office agency to exercise strong leadership in our national mobilization effort, including both current defense activities and readiness for any future national emergency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Security Resources Board was established by the National Security Act of 1947 to advise the President concerning various aspects of future military, industrial, and civilian mobilization. The areas of responsibility assigned to the Board included the use of national and industrial resources for military and civilian needs; the sufficiency of productive facilities; the strategic relocation of industries; the mobilization and maximum utilization of manpower; and the maintenance and stabilization of the civilian economy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The vigorous and efficient discharge of these vital functions is not well served by the simultaneous existence in the Executive Office of the President of the National Security Resources Board (charged with planning for the future) and the present Office of Defense Mobilization (charged with programs of the present). The progress of the current mobilization effort has made plain how artificial is the present separation of these functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Both functions should now be combined into one defense mobilization agency. Accordingly, the reorganization plan would create in the Executive Office of the President a new agency, to be known as the Office of Defense Mobilization. It would transfer to the new Office the functions of the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board and abolish that Board, including the offices of Chairman and Vice Chairman.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan also transfers to the new agency the statutory functions of the present Office of Defense Mobilization. These are of a minor nature, the major functions of the present Office of Defense Mobilization having been delegated to it by the President, principally under the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. It is my intention to transfer the latter functions to the new agency by Executive order, and to abolish the Office of Defense Mobilization established by Executive Order No. 10193. There will thus result a new agency which combines the activities of the National Security Resources Board and both the statutory and delegated functions of the heretofore existing Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proposed plan would also reorganize various activities relating to the stockpiling of strategic and critical materials. Those activities are principally provided for in the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended. It has become increasingly apparent that the policy and program aspects of stockpiling are an integral part of mobilization planning. They should not be administered separately from plant expansion, conservation of materials, and materials procurement under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or from the duties placed in the National Security Resources Board by the National Security Act of 1947. Therefore, the reorganization plan would transfer to the Director of the new Office of Defense Mobilization responsibility for major stockpiling actions, including the determination of the nature and quantities of materials to be stockpiled. In the main, these functions are transferred from the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force (acting jointly through the agency of the Munitions Board) and the Secretary of the Interior. The duties of the Administrator of General Services regarding the purchase of strategic and critical materials and the management of stockpiles are not affected by the reorganization plan, except that he will receive his directions, under the plan, from the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization instead of from the Department of Defense.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This transfer of stockpiling functions will correct the present undesirable confusion of responsibilities. The functions of the heads of the military departments of the Department of Defense and the Secretary of the Interior under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, are at present in considerable measure subject to other authority of delegates of the President springing from the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended. The allocation and distribution of scarce materials among essential civilian and military activities and the continued maintenance of adequate stockpiles of strategic and critical materials are of major current importance. The reorganization plan will make possible more effective coordination and close control over the Government’s whole stockpile program. It will speed decisions. It can result in significant economies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of Defense will, of course, continue to be responsible for presenting the needs of the military services. That Department and the Department of the Interior are specifically designated in the plan as additional agencies which shall appoint representatives to cooperate with the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization in determining which materials are strategic and critical and how much of them is to be purchased. Final authority with regard to such determination will, however, be in the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 5(a) of the reorganization plan withholds from transfer to the Director and abolishes the functions of the Chairman of the National Security Resources Board with regard to being consulted by and furnishing advice to the President concerning the placing of orders of mandatory precedence for articles or materials for the use of the armed forces of the United States or for the use of the Atomic Energy Commission, and with regard to determining that a plant, mine, or other facility can be readily converted to the production or furnishing of such articles or materials. These abolished functions were vested in the National Security Resources Board by section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948 (later renamed as the Universal Military Training and Service Act) and were transferred to the Chairman of that Board by Reorganization Plan No. 25 of 1950. The practical effect of this abolition is to obviate a statutory mandate that the President consult and advise with another officer of the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 5(b) of the reorganization plan abolishes the direction, authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense over functions transferred from the Department of Defense by the reorganization plan. The Secretary’s functions in this regard are provided for in section 202(b) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s171a/b">5 U.S.C. 171a(b)</ref>) [see <ref href="/us/usc/t10/s113/b">10 U.S.C. 113(b)</ref>].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Section 5(c) of the reorganization plan abolishes any functions which were vested in the Army and Navy Munitions Board or which are vested in the Munitions Board with respect to serving as the agent through which the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Interior jointly act in determining which materials are strategic and critical under the provisions of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, and the quality and quantities of such materials to be stockpiled. These abolished functions are provided for in section 2(a) of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that by reason of these reorganizations it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of a Director and a Deputy Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers of the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan will permit better organization and management of the Federal programs relating to materials and requirements and will thus help to achieve the maximum degree of mobilization readiness at the least possible cost. It is not practicable, however, to itemize, in advance of actual experience, the reductions of expenditures to be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1953.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I urge that the Congress allow the proposed reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The purpose of the reorganization plan is to simplify the organization and strengthen the administration of the Export-Import Bank of Washington by providing for a single Managing Director at the head of the bank. The management of the bank is now vested in a Board of Directors consisting of four full-time members and the Secretary of State, ex officio. The functions performed by the Board are essentially of an executive nature and are comparable to those vested in the heads of other executive agencies. Experience has demonstrated that the most effective performance of executive functions is more likely to be obtained under a single administrator than under a board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan concentrates authority and responsibility for bank operations in the Managing Director. Safeguards are provided in the plan and in existing law, however, to assure that the bank follows sound lending and financial policies and that its activities are coordinated with those of other Government agencies having international responsibilities. Under the plan, the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems is authorized to establish the general lending and other financial policies which shall govern the operations of the bank. The Council is composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, as chairman, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Director for Mutual Security.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At present the Board of Directors is not only subject to policy guidance by the National Advisory Council, under the provisions of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, but is also required to consult with the Advisory Board for the Export-Import Bank, created by the Export-Import Bank Act, on major questions of policy and to receive recommendations from that Board. The composition of the Advisory Board largely parallels that of the Council. The differences are that only the latter includes the Director for Mutual Security as a member and that the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank is the Chairman of the Advisory Board whereas the Secretary of the Treasury serves as the Chairman of the Council. Because of the similarity of the composition of the Advisory Board and Council, and of their functions as respects the bank, the reorganization plan abolishes the Advisory Board. It also abolishes the functions of the Advisory Board (conferred by sec. 3(d) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan also provides for the abolition of the functions of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of Washington with respect to his membership on the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems. The function of membership is conferred upon the Chairman by section 4 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended. I contemplate that the Managing Director of the Export-Import Bank of Washington will participate as a nonvoting member of the National Advisory Council in relation to matters of concern to the bank. I believe there is merit in reducing the size of the Council and also believe that the interests of the bank can be properly placed before the Council without conferring full Council membership on the Managing Director of the Bank.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the reorganization plan the Export-Import Bank of Washington will continue in its status of a corporate entity, and independent agency, in the executive branch of the Government. The President will retain authority to terminate or modify any delegation or assignment of function made by the President to the bank or to any of its agencies or officers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I also have found and hereby declare that by reason of these reorganizations it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan provision for the appointment and compensation of the new officers specified in sections 1, 2, and 3 of the reorganization plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1953 will accomplish a small immediate reduction of expenditures, since it will substitute 1 Managing Director, together with a deputy and assistant, for a Board which includes 4 full-time members. Other reductions in expenditures will probably be brought about also, through increased economy and efficiency in the performance of necessary services of the bank resulting from the simplification of its organization, but such reductions cannot be itemized in advance of actual experience.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I address the Congress on a subject which has been of primary interest to me throughout all the years of my adult life—the defense of our country.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As a former soldier who has experienced modern war at first hand, and now as President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, I believe that our Defense Establishment is in need of immediate improvement. In this message I indicate actions which we are taking, and must yet take, to assure the greater safety of America.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Through the years our Nation has warded off all enemies. We have defended ourselves successfully against those who have waged war against us. We enjoy, as a people, a proud tradition of triumph in battle.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We are not, however, a warlike people. Our historic goal is peace. It shall ever be peace—peace to enjoy the freedom we cherish and the fruits of our labors. We maintain strong military forces in support of this supreme purpose, for we believe that in today’s world only properly organized strength may altogether avert war.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because we are not a military-minded people, we have sometimes failed to give proper thought to the problems of the organization and adequacy of our Armed Forces. Past periods of international stress and the actual outbreaks of wars have found us poorly prepared. On such occasions we have had to commit to battle insufficient and improperly organized military forces to hold the foe until our citizenry could be more fully mobilized and our resources marshaled. We know that we cannot permit a repetition of those conditions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today we live in a perilous period of international affairs. Soviet Russia and her allies have it within their power to join with us in the establishment of a true peace or to plunge the world into global war. To date they have chosen to conduct themselves in such a way that these are years neither of total war nor total peace.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We in the United States have, therefore, recently embarked upon the definition of a new, positive foreign policy. One of our basic aims is to gain again for the free world the initiative in shaping the international conditions under which freedom can thrive. Essential to this endeavor is the assurance of an alert, efficient, ever-prepared Defense Establishment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today our international undertakings are shared by the free peoples of other nations. We find ourselves in an unparalleled role of leadership of free men everywhere. With this leadership have come new responsibilities. With the basic purpose of assuring our own security and economic viability, we are helping our friends to protect their lives and liberties. And one major help that we may give them is reliance upon our own Military Establishment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today also witnesses one of history’s times of swiftest advance in scientific achievements. These developments can accomplish wonders in providing a healthier and happier life for us all. But—converted to military uses—they threaten new, more devastating terrors in war. These simple, inescapable facts make imperative the maintenance of a defense organization commanding the most modern technological instruments in our arsenal of weapons.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In providing the kind of military security that our country needs, we must keep our people free and our economy solvent. We must not endanger the very things we seek to defend. We must not create a nation mighty in arms that is lacking in liberty and bankrupt in resources. Our armed strength must continue to rise from the vigor of a free people and a prosperous economy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Recognizing all these national and international demands upon our Military Establishment, we must remain ever mindful of three great objectives in organizing our defense.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">First: Our Military Establishment must be founded upon our basic constitutional principles and traditions. There must be a clear and unchallenged civilian responsibility in the Defense Establishment. This is essential not only to maintain democratic institutions, but also to protect the integrity of the military profession. Basic decisions relating to the military forces must be made by politically accountable civilian officials. Conversely, professional military leaders must not be thrust into the political arena to become the prey of partisan politics. To guard these principles, we must recognize and respect the clear lines of responsibility and authority which run from the President, through the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments, over the operations of all branches of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second: Effectiveness with economy must be made the watchwords of our defense effort. To maintain an adequate national defense for the indefinite future, we have found it necessary to devote a larger share of our national resources than any of us have heretofore anticipated. To protect our economy, maximum effectiveness at minimum cost is essential.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Third: We must develop the best possible military plans. These plans must be sound guides to action in case of war. They must incorporate the most competent and considered thinking from every point of view—military, scientific, industrial, and economic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To strengthen civilian control by establishing clear lines of accountability, to further effectiveness with economy, and to provide adequate planning for military purposes—these were primarily objectives of the Congress in enacting the National Security Act of 1947 and strengthening it in 1949.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Now much has happened which makes it appropriate to review the workings of those basic statutes. Valuable lessons have been learned through 6 years of trial by experience. Our top military structure has been observed under changing conditions. The military action in Korea, the buildup of our forces everywhere, the provision of military aid to other friendly nations, and the participation of United States Armed Forces in regional collective security arrangements, such as those under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization—all these have supplied sharp tests of our military organization. Today, in making my specific recommendations, I have also had the benefit of the report prepared by the Committee on Department of Defense Organization established by the Secretary of Defense 3 months ago.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The time is here, then, to work to perfect our Military Establishment without delay.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">I</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The first objective, toward which immediate actions already are being directed, is clarification of lines of authority within the Department of Defense so as to strengthen civilian responsibility.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am convinced that the fundamental structure of our Department of Defense and its various component agencies as provided by the National Security Act, as amended, is sound. None of the changes I am proposing affects that basic structure, and this first objective can and will be attained without any legislative change.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With my full support, the Secretary of Defense must exercise over the Department of Defense the direction, authority, and control which are vested in him by the National Security Act. He should do so through the basic channels of responsibility and authority prescribed in that act—through the three civilian Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, who are responsible to him for all aspects of the respective military departments (except for the legal responsibility of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to advise the President in military matters). No function in any part of the Department of Defense, or in any of its component agencies, should be performed independent of the direction, authority, and control of the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary is the accountable civilian head of the Department of Defense, and, under the law, my principal assistant in all matters relating to the Department. I want all to know that he has my full backing in that role.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To clarify a point which has led to considerable confusion in the past, the Secretary of Defense, with my approval, will shortly issue a revision of that portion of the 1948 memorandum commonly known as the Key West agreement, which provides for a system of designating executive agents for unified commands. Basic decisions with respect to the establishment and direction of unified commands are made by the President and the Secretary of Defense, upon the recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in their military planning and advisory role. But the provision of the Key West agreement, under which the Joint Chiefs of Staff designate one of their members as an executive agent for each unified command, has led to considerable confusion and misunderstanding with respect to the relationship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the Secretary of Defense, and the relationship of the military chief of each service to the civilian Secretary of his military department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Hence, the Secretary of Defense, with my approval, is revising the Key West agreement to provide that the Secretary of Defense shall designate in each case a military department to serve as the executive agent for a unified command. Under this new arrangement the channel of responsibility and authority to a commander of a unified command will unmistakably be from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the designated civilian Secretary of a military department. This arrangement will fix responsibility along a definite channel of accountable civilian officials as intended by the National Security Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It will be understood, however, that, for the strategic direction and operational control of forces and for the conduct of combat operations, the military chief of the designated military department will be authorized by the Secretary of Defense to receive and transmit reports and orders and to act for that department in its executive agency capacity. This arrangement will make it always possible to deal promptly with emergency or wartime situations. The military chief will clearly be acting in the name and by the direction of the Secretary of Defense. Promulgated orders will directly state that fact.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By taking this action to provide clearer lines of responsibility and authority for the exercise of civilian control, I believe we will make significant progress toward increasing proper accountability in the top levels of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">II</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Our second major objective is effectiveness with economy. Although the American people, throughout their history, have hoped to avoid supporting large military forces, today we must obviously maintain a strong military force to ward off attack, at a moment’s notice, by enemies equipped with the most devastating weapons known to modern science. This need for immediate preparedness makes it all the more imperative to see that the Nation maintains effective military forces in the manner imposing the minimum burden on the national economy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In an organization the size of the Department of Defense, true effectiveness with economy can be attained only by decentralization of operations, under flexible and effective direction and control from the center. I am impressed with the determination of the Secretary of Defense to administer the Department on this basis and to look to the Secretaries of the three military departments as his principal agents for the management and direction of the entire defense enterprise.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Such a system of decentralized operations, however, requires, for sound management, flexible machinery at the top. Unfortunately, this is not wholly possible in the Department of Defense as now established by law. Two principal fields of activity are rigidly assigned by law to unwieldy boards which—no matter how much authority may be centralized in their respective chairmen—provide organizational arrangements too slow and too clumsy to serve as effective management tools for the Secretary. In addition, other staff agencies have been set up in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and their functions prescribed by law, thus making it difficult for the Secretary to adjust his staff arrangements to deal with new problems as they arise, or to provide for flexible cooperation among the several staff agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly, I am transmitting today to the Congress a reorganization plan which is designed to provide the Secretary of Defense with a more efficient staff organization. The plan calls for the abolition of the Munitions Board, the Research and Development Board, the Defense Supply Management Agency, and the office of Director of Installations and vests their functions in the Secretary of Defense. At the same time the plan authorizes the appointment of new Assistant Secretaries of Defense to whom the Secretary of Defense intends to assign the functions now vested in the agencies to be abolished and certain other functions now assigned to other officials. Specifically, the reorganization plan provides for 6 additional Assistant Secretaries—3 to whom the Secretary will assign the duties now performed by the 2 Boards (based on a redistribution of staff functions), 2 who will be utilized to replace individual officials who presently hold other titles, and 1 to be assigned to a position formerly but no longer filled by an Assistant Secretary. The new Assistant Secretary positions are required in order to make it possible to bring executives of the highest type to the Government service and to permit them to operate effectively and with less personnel than at present. In addition, the plan also provides that, in view of the importance of authoritative legal opinions and interpretations, the office of General Counsel be raised to a statutory position with rank substantially equivalent to that of an Assistant Secretary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The abolition of the present statutory staff agencies and the provision of the new Assistant Secretaries to aid the Secretary of Defense will be the key to the attainment of increased effectiveness at low cost in the Department of Defense. These steps will permit the Secretary to make a thorough reorganization of the nonmilitary staff agencies in his office. He will be able to establish truly effective and vigorous staff units under the leadership of the Assistant Secretaries. Each Assistant Secretary will function as a staff head within an assigned field of responsibility.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Without imposing themselves in the direct lines of responsibility and authority between the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the three military departments, the Assistant Secretaries of Defense will provide the Secretary with a continuing review of the programs of the Defense Establishment and help him institute major improvements in their execution. They will be charged with establishing systems, within their assigned fields, for obtaining complete and accurate information to support recommendations to the Secretary. The Assistant Secretaries will make frequent inspection visits to our farflung installations and check for the Secretary the effectiveness and efficiency of operations in their assigned fields.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Other improvements are badly needed in the Departments of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. Accordingly, the Secretary of Defense is initiating studies by the three Secretaries of the military departments of the internal organization of their departments with a view toward making those Secretaries truly responsible administrators, thereby obtaining greater effectiveness and attaining economies wherever possible. These studies will apply to the organization of the military departments some of the same principles of clearer lines of accountability which we are applying to the Department of Defense as a whole.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Immediate attention will also be given to studying improvements of those parts of the military departments directly concerned with the procurement and distribution of munitions and supplies and the inventory and accounting systems within each military department. We must take every step toward seeing that our Armed Forces are adequately supplied at all times with the materials essential for them to carry on their operations in the field. Necessary to this effort is a reorganization of supply machinery in the military departments. These studies of the organization of the military departments have my full support.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One other area for improved effectiveness is civilian and military personnel management. In this area certain specialized studies and actions are desirable. Accordingly, I have directed the Secretary of Defense to organize a study of the problems of attracting and holding competent career personnel—civilian and military—in the Department of Defense. As a part of this study, an examination of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 and its practical administration will be undertaken to see if any changes are needed. I am directing that this study also include a review of statutes governing the retirement of military officers aimed at eliminating those undesirable provisions which force the early retirement of unusually capable officers who are willing to continue on active service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Secretary of Defense, with my approval, is issuing revised orders relating to the preparing and signing of efficiency reports for military personnel who serve full time in the Office of the Secretary, and new instructions to the military departments to guide selection boards in their operations. These actions are aimed at giving full credit to military officers serving in the Office of the Secretary of Defense for their work for the Department of Defense as a whole. Henceforth, civilian officials who have military officers detailed to their offices on a full-time basis will be responsible for filling out and signing the formal efficiency reports for such officers for the period of such service. In the case of officers serving in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, no other efficiency reports for such service will be maintained. The Secretary of each military department is being instructed to direct the boards convened in his department for the selection of military officers for promotion, to give the same weight to service in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the efficiency reports from that Office as to service in the military department staff and to efficiency reports of departmental officers. These actions are desirable in order to reward military officers equally for service on behalf of the Department of Defense and service on the staff of a military department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These actions and others which will be undertaken are aimed at a more effective and efficient Department of Defense; indeed, actions toward this objective will be continuous.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The impact of all these measures will be felt through the whole structure of the Department of Defense, its utilization of millions of personnel and billions of dollars. A simple token testimony to this is this fact: in the Office of the Secretary of Defense alone a staff reduction of approximately 500 persons will be effected.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">III</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Our third broad objective is to improve our machinery for strategic planning for national security. Certain actions toward this end may be taken administratively to improve the organization and procedures within the Department of Defense. Other changes are incorporated in the reorganization plan transmitted to the Congress today.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Joint Chiefs of Staff, as provided in the National Security Act of 1947, are not a command body but are the principal military advisers to the President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of Defense. They are responsible for formulating the strategic plans by which the United States will cope with the challenge of any enemy. The three members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who are the military chiefs of their respective services are responsible to their Secretaries for the efficiency of their services and their readiness for war.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These officers are clearly overworked, and steps must be devised to relieve them of time-consuming details of minor importance. They must be encouraged to delegate lesser duties to reliable subordinate individuals and agencies in both the Joint Chiefs of Staff structure and in their military-department staffs. One of our aims in making more effective our strategic planning machinery, therefore, is to improve the organization and procedures of the supporting staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff so that the Chiefs, acting as a body, will be better able to perform their roles as strategic planners and military advisers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Our military plans are based primarily on military factors, but they must also take into account a wider range of policy and economic factors, as well as the latest developments of modern science. Therefore, our second aim in assuring the very best strategic planning is to broaden the degree of active participation of other persons and units at the staff level in the consideration of matters before the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to bring to bear more diversified and expert skills.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan transmitted to the Congress today is designed—without detracting from the military advisory functions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as a group—to place upon the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff greater responsibility for organizing and directing the subordinate structure of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in such a way as to help the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff discharge their total responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Specifically, the reorganization plan makes the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff responsible for managing the work of the Joint Staff and its Director. The Joint Staff is, of course, a study-and-reporting body serving the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The plan makes the service of the Director of the Joint Staff subject to the approval of the Secretary of Defense. It also makes the service of officers on the Joint Staff subject to the approval of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These new responsibilities of the Chairman are in consonance with his present functions of serving as the presiding officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, providing agenda for meetings, assisting the Joint Chiefs of Staff to perform their duties as promptly as practicable, and keeping the Secretary of Defense and the President informed of issues before the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition, the proposed changes will relieve the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as a body, of a large amount of administrative detail involved in the management of its subordinate committee and staff structure.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In support of our second aim, broadened participation in strategic planning, the Secretary of Defense will direct the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to arrange for the fullest cooperation of the Joint Staff and the subcommittees of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with other parts of the Office of the Secretary of Defense in the early stages of staff work on any major problem. If necessary, to aid in this additional burden, an Assistant or Deputy Director of the Joint Staff will be designated to give particular attention to this staff collaboration. Thus, at the developmental stages of important staff studies by the subordinate elements of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there will be a proper integration of the views and special skills of the other staff agencies of the Department, such as those responsible for budget, manpower, supply, research, and engineering. This action will assure the presentation of improved staff products to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for their consideration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Also, special attention will be given to providing for the participation of competent civilian scientists and engineers within the substructure of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Such participants will be able to contribute a wide range of scientific information and knowledge to our strategic planning.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Only by including outstanding civilian experts in the process of strategic planning can our military services bring new weapons rapidly into their established weapons systems, make recommendations with respect to the use of new systems of weapons in the future war plans, and see that the whole range of scientific information and knowledge of fundamental cost factors are taken into account in strategic planning.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Taken together, the changes included in the reorganization plan and the several administrative actions should go a long way toward improving the strategic planning machinery of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and lead to the development of plans based on the broadest conception of the overall national interest rather than the particular desires of the individual services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganizations in the Department of Defense.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of six additional Assistant Secretaries of Defense and a General Counsel of the Department of Defense. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are those which I have found to prevail in respect to comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The statutory authority for the exercise of the function of guidance to the Munitions Board in connection with strategic and logistic plans, abolished by section 2(d) of the reorganization plan, is section 213(c) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1953 is expected to result in a more effective, efficient, and economical performance of functions in the Department of Defense. It is impracticable to specify or itemize at this time the reduction of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Congress is a full partner in actions to strengthen our Military Establishment. Jointly we must carry forward a sound program to keep America strong. The Congress and the President, acting in their proper spheres, must perform their duties to the American people in support of our highest traditions. Should, for any reason, the national military policy become a subject of partisan politics, the only loser would be the American people.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We owe it to all the people to maintain the best Military Establishment that we know how to devise. There are none, however, to whom we owe it more than the soldiers, the sailors, the marines, and the airmen in uniform whose lives are pledged to the defense of our freedom.</p>

My reasons for proposing this plan are stated in another message transmitted to the Congress today.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of officers specified in section 1 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I expect that the improved organizational arrangement provided for in Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 will lead to substantial economies and significantly improved effectiveness of administration.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 9 of 1953, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended and providing reorganizations in the Council of Economic Advisers in the Executive Office of the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The legislative history of the Employment Act of 1946 makes it clear that it is the determination of the Congress to help develop a strong economy in the United States. A strong economy is necessary to preserve the peace, to build our defenses and those of the free world, to raise the living standards of our people, and to stimulate trade and industry in friendly countries throughout the world.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A strong economy means a free economy—with full opportunities for the exercise of initiative and enterprise on the part of all individuals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It means a stable economy—so that satisfying jobs are as numerous as the men and women seeking work, and the production of goods is abundant to meet our needs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It means an expanding economy—in which workers, managers, and farmers, using more and better tools, constantly increase the output of useful products and services and receive steadily rising incomes in a dollar of stable value.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It means a humane economy—to the end that the aged, infirm, and those suffering hardships receive every needed help.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The achievement and preservation of a strong economy—an economy that is progressive as well as competitive, an economy that remains free from the distortions of inflation and the ravages of depression, an economy that forms the solid foundation for the flourishing of our democratic, social, and political institutions—is everybody’s job. Workers, businessmen, bankers, farmers, housewives—all have an important role to play. The Federal Government, too, shares in this vital task. For example, the duties of the President require that he be fully informed of major economic trends and activities in order to recommend proper measures for the consideration of the Congress, and to take into account economic realities in seeing that the laws be faithfully executed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is well that the Congress has declared in the Employment Act of 1946, the continuing policy and responsibility of the Federal Government to coordinate and utilize all its plans, functions, and resources for the purpose of creating and maintaining, consistently with free competitive enterprise and the general welfare, employment opportunities for all. That act dedicates the Federal Government to the promotion of maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To assist in carrying out those purposes, the Congress provided for the establishment of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Executive Office of the President to make appropriate recommendations to the President and to assist in the preparation of his annual economic report to the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I believe in the basic principles of the Employment Act, and it is my purpose to take the appropriate actions to reinvigorate and make more effective the operations of the Council of Economic Advisers. Our needs for proper advice on economic matters are equaled only by our needs to have the very best advice and planning on matters of national security.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In taking these actions, I have the benefit of the study and work of the Economic Adviser to the President recently provided by the Congress. The Economic Adviser has reviewed the past operations of the Council of Economic Advisers and has recommended to me a series of actions aimed at making it more fully effective in performing its statutory duties.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly, I intend to appoint a full membership of three members to the Council of Economic Advisers and to recommend to the Congress that adequate funds be appropriated to operate the Council as a fully going unit capable of providing the kind of economic staff work required.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The accompanying reorganization plan provides changes which strengthen the internal administration of the Council and clarify its relationships with the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To achieve the first objective—strengthened internal administration—the reorganization plan will make the Chairman of the Council, rather than the whole Council, responsible for certain administrative functions of the Council. Because the Council is essentially an advisory body, these administrative functions relate principally to managing the staff employed to assist the Council. Placing the Chairman in a position to perform these functions will obtain the benefits of single management of the staff. To make possible such an arrangement, the accompanying reorganization plan transfers to the Chairman the functions vested in the Council of Economic Advisers by section 4(b) of the Employment Act, which relate to employing the staff and other necessary specialists and consultants to work for the Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To further the other objective—a clearer relationship with the President—the reorganization plan transfers to the Chairman the function of reporting to the President on the activities of the Council. This change will improve and simplify the relationship of the Council to the President and enable the President to deal with the Council more directly through the Chairman.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The increased responsibilities placed upon the Chairman by this plan would, in my judgment, make it appropriate for the Congress to take action to increase the compensation of the Chairman.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan provides for the elimination of the Vice Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, whose designation is provided for in the last sentence of section 4(a) of the Employment Act of 1946. The objective of this step is to place the members of the Council, other than the Chairman, in an equal status. I shall make provision for one of the members of the Council, other than the Chairman, to act as Chairman of the Council on such occasions as necessity may arise therefor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to make the work of the Council of Economic Advisers more effective at the top policy level of the executive branch, I am also asking the heads of several departments and agencies, or the representatives they may designate, to serve as an Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stability, under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. At all times, close liaison must be maintained by the Council with all departments and agencies, and with interdepartmental committees, especially the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is contemplated that the Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stability, supported by the existing staffs of the various departments and agencies, will meet frequently, and through its Chairman will keep me closely informed about the state of the national economy and the various measures necessary to aid in maintaining a stable prosperity.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because of the complexity of our economy and the variety of views regarding its problems, I shall expect the new Council of Economic Advisers to seek advice energetically not only from the departments and agencies of the Federal Government but also from representatives of industry, agriculture, labor, consumers, and other groups concerned with economic matters, from representatives of State and local governments, and from universities. I want the best economic thinking in the country to be canvassed by the Council. Through advisory groups, through the employment of expert consultants, and through informal relationships with informed citizens the Council will make use of economic talent wherever it may be.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I deem it especially significant that the Congress has provided in the Employment Act for the Joint Committee on the Economic Report, composed of Members of both Houses of the Congress, to study matters relating to the economic report and to make recommendations to the two Houses for legislation. I expect to impress upon the Council of Economic Advisers the importance which I attach to the fullest cooperation of the Council with the Joint Committee to assist the Joint Committee in its important tasks.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in the accompanying reorganization plan is expected to result in a more effective performance of the statutory functions of the Council of Economic Advisers and to provide the President with better advice upon economic matters. It is impracticable to specify or itemize at this time any reduction of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of this reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan will make the Federal Government better able to carry out its responsibilities to the American people to foster a strong, free, and prosperous economy so that we may all enjoy an ever-rising standard of living. I urge the Congress to permit the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1954, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan establishes a new Government agency, the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States; transfers to that Commission the functions of the War Claims Commission and of the International Claims Commission of the United States; and abolishes the latter two Commissions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission will be composed of three members appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The President will designate one of the members as Chairman of the Commission. The Chairman will be responsible for the internal management of the affairs of the Commission. The reorganization plan contains provisions designed to assure smooth administration of functions during the period of transition to the new organization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The War Claims Commission was created as a temporary agency by the War Claims Act of 1948. The Commission was made responsible for settling certain claims of former United States World War II prisoners of war, civilian internees captured or in hiding to avoid capture in the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, and the Midway Islands, and certain religious organizations in the Philippines which had aided American forces during the war. In 1952, the Commission was assigned, additionally, the administration of claims of Philippine religious organizations which sustained losses of their educational, medical, and welfare facilities in the war, and of benefits to United States prisoners of war for inhumane treatment during internment by the enemy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">From its inception in 1949 to <date date="1954-04-01">April 1, 1954</date>, approximately 500,000 claims were filed with the War Claims Commission, and approximately $134 million was paid to claimants. Approximately 96,000 remaining claims are in the process of settlement, and the Commission must complete action on them, together with such appeals as may be filed, by <date date="1955-03-31">March 31, 1955</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The International Claims Commission was established within the Department of State by the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949. Its immediate function was to adjudicate claims covered by a settlement of $17 million which was deposited with the Government of the United States by the Yugoslav Government primarily to compensate our nationals for losses sustained through nationalization of properties. The act also authorized the Commission to settle such claims as might be included later in any similar agreement between the United States and a foreign government. Subsequently, the Commission was assigned the administration of a $400,000 settlement negotiated with the Government of Panama.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">From its establishment in 1950 to <date date="1954-04-01">April 1, 1954</date>, the International Claims Commission has settled 531 claims out of a total of 1,622 filed. Of this total, 1,555 claims were against Yugoslavia and 67 were against Panama. Under the act, settlement of the remaining Yugoslav claims must be completed by <date date="1954-12-31">December 31, 1954</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The accompanying reorganization plan has substantial potential advantages. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission will be able to administer any additional claims programs financed by funds derived from foreign governments without the delay which has often characterized the initiation of past programs. Moreover, the use of an existing agency will be more economical than the establishment of a new commission to administer a given type of foreign claims program. Consolidation of the affairs of the two present Commissions will also permit the retention and use of the best experience gained during the last several years in the field of claims settlement. The declining workload of current programs can be meshed with the rising workload of new programs with maximum efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A proposed new claims program now pending before the Senate would provide benefits similar to those paid to World War II victims under the War Claims Act for losses and internments resulting from hostilities in Korea. The executive branch of the Government has recommended approval of this program by the Congress. I now suggest that this program be assigned by law to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There should also be assigned to this new Commission the settlement of such of the claims programs as may be authorized from among those recommended by the War Claims Commission in its report made pursuant to section 8 of the War Claims Act. That report, posing many complex policy, legal, and administrative problems, is now being reviewed by executive agencies; and recommendations will soon be sent to the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By peace treaties and an international agreement, the United States has acquired the right to utilize certain external assets and settlement funds of several countries. A total of about $39 million is available to indemnify claims of United States nationals against the Governments of Rumania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Italy, arising out of war damage or confiscations in those countries. In addition, claims growing out of United States losses from default on obligations and nationalization of properties may be settled by awards from $9 million realized from an agreement made in 1933 with the Soviet Union, known as the Litvinov assignment. Action by the Congress is necessary before these various funds may be assigned for settlement, and recommendations of the executive branch in this connection will be transmitted at an early date.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to the reorganizations I have described, the reorganization plan transfers to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission the functions of the Commissioner provided for in the joint resolution of <date date="1939-08-04">August 4, 1939</date>. These functions involve the receipt and administration of claims covered by the Litvinov assignment. The office of Commissioner, for which funds have never been appropriated and which has never been filled, is abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan does not transfer the war claims fund or the Yugoslav claims fund from the Department of the Treasury, or divest the Secretary of the Treasury of any functions under the War Claims Act of 1948, as amended, or under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949, as amended. It does not limit the responsibility of the Secretary of State with respect to the conduct of foreign affairs. The reorganizations contained in the reorganization plan will not prejudice any interest or potential interest of any claimant.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended [<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s133z/a">section 133z(a) of this title</ref>]. I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of officers specified in section 1 of the plan. The rate of compensation fixed for each of these officers is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The statutory citation for certain functions of the Secretary of State with respect to the International Claims Commission which are abolished by the reorganization plan, is the third and fourth sentences of section 3(c) of the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 (<ref href="/us/stat/64/13">64 Stat. 13</ref>), as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is at this time impracticable to specify the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations contained in the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1954 provides a single agency for the orderly completion of present claims programs. In addition, it provides an effective organization for the settlement of future authorized claims programs by utilizing the experience gained by present claims agencies. It provides unified administrative direction of the functions concerned, and it simplifies the organizational structure of the executive branch. I urge that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) In addition to the transfers made by section 3 (a), above, there shall be transferred to each transferee agency so much as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall determine to be appropriate by reason of transfers made by sections 1, 2, and 3(a) of this reorganization plan of the property, personnel, records, liabilities and commitments of the Corporation and of the authorizations, allocations, and funds available or to be made available to the Corporation or the Treasury Department.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 4. Definition</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As used in this reorganization plan, the term “transferee agencies” means the Export-Import Bank of Washington, the Small Business Administration, and the Federal National Mortgage Association.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 5. Effective Date</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The provisions of this reorganization plan shall take effect at the time determined under the provisions of section 6(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended or at the close of <date date="1954-06-30">June 30, 1954</date>, whichever is later, and shall be effective notwithstanding any heretofore enacted provisions of law transferring the duty of completing the liquidation of the assets and the winding up of the affairs of the Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1954, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. The reorganization plan assigns to appropriate agencies the liquidation of certain affairs of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">First, the reorganization plan transfers to the Export-Import Bank of Washington loans made to foreign financial institutions and to foreign governments, including a loan to the Republic of the Philippines; all foreign bonds and securities acquired in the liquidation of Corporation lending programs; and functions with respect to the liquidation of those assets. The bank is this Government’s principal instrument for the administration of similar matters and can readily integrate the liquidation of the transferred assets with its other activities in the field of foreign finance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, the reorganization plan transfers to the Small Business Administration loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to victims of floods or other catastrophes, together with the function of liquidating those loans. The Small Business Administration is responsible for a similar loan program. Thus, by this transfer, related activities are concentrated in a single agency for effective administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Third, the reorganization plan transfers to the Federal National Mortgage Association, in the Housing and Home Finance Agency, real estate mortgages made or acquired under the authority of the RFC Mortgage Company and the Defense Homes Corporation, and the function of liquidating these assets. The Association is responsible under its basic authority for the servicing, liquidation, and sale of the bulk of residential real estate mortgages held by the Government of the United States. Through its field offices, the Association maintains continuous relationships with lending and investing institutions specializing in home financing. It is, therefore, the Federal agency best situated to liquidate the assets of a similar type transferred to it by the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under existing authority, the completion of the liquidation of the assets and the winding up of the affairs of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation will be carried out under the direction of the Secretary of the Treasury after the succession of the Corporation expires on <date date="1954-06-30">June 30, 1954</date>. The reorganization plan modifies that arrangement by placing responsibility for the completion of each of the activities described above under the jurisdiction of an agency responsible for a similar continuing program. Thus, the reorganization plan facilitates the orderly and expeditious liquidation of the affairs of the Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is not, however, practicable at this time to specify the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations contained in the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1954 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1957, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The liquidation of the assets and the winding up of the affairs of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation have been proceeding for the past several years, in accordance with law. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1954 expedited and simplified liquidation by transferring certain functions of the Corporation to the Export-Import Bank of Washington, the Small Business Administration, and the Federal National Mortgage Association. Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1957 transfers all present functions of the Corporation to appropriate officers and abolishes the Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">First, the reorganization plan transfers to the Housing and Home Finance Administrator functions of the Corporation relating to items resulting from programs which provided assistance to States, municipalities, and other public agencies in financing various public projects. Also transferred are functions relating to the liquidation of programs of financial aid for drainage and irrigation projects.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, the plan transfers to the Administrator of General Services functions related to the liquidation of matters arising from national defense, war and reconversion activities conducted by the Corporation preceding, during, and subsequent to World War II. Functions relating to the liquidation of the Smaller War Plants Corporation are also transferred to the Administrator.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Third, the plan transfers to the Administrator of the Small Business Administration (1) all of the Corporation’s disaster loan functions which were not transferred to the Small Business Administration by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1954, and (2) all matters arising out of the Corporation’s financial-assistance programs to business enterprises except those relating to assistance to railroads, financial institutions, and insurance companies and those listed in schedule A. The first category consists of items, such as paid loans, charged-off loans and closed files, which were not embraced by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1954. The second category includes generally loans or other matters involving outstanding amounts under $250,000 arising under financial-assistance programs to business enterprises, as well as all functions relating to paid or charged-off loans, regardless of amount, under such programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Finally, the plan transfers to the Secretary of the Treasury all of the functions of the Corporation not otherwise transferred by the plan. Those functions relate principally to the obligations and loans listed in schedule A, which consist generally of business loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of $250,000, and to financial assistance to railroad companies, financial institutions, and insurance companies. The Secretary of the Treasury will also receive the capital stock of the War Damage Corporation, dissolution of which is expected in the near future when one remaining lawsuit is concluded.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions transferred by the reorganization plan are, in general, similar to, and can appropriately be administered in conjunction with, present activities of the respective transferees.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan also transfers the pertinent assets of the Corporation to the respective agencies, together with the related liabilities, and by operation of law substitutes the particular transferee for the Corporation with respect to all instruments of every kind and character pertaining to the transferred functions, assets, and liabilities. In order to permit the transferees to administer the transferred matters with the same flexibility of operation as obtains at present, the plan transfers to each transferee those powers, authority, rights, and immunities which are now available or applicable to the Corporation for carrying out the respective functions. To the extent that it becomes necessary or desirable, therefore, the transferees will be enabled, with respect to the transferred functions, to sue and be sued, to engage private attorneys in conjunction with litigation involving the transferred functions, and to avail themselves of any other authority, powers or immunities now available to the Corporation, whether under the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, as amended, or otherwise. In enacting the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Liquidation Act the Congress included a provision reading:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The activities engaged in by the Secretary of the Treasury as a result of the enactment of this Act shall continue to be subject to the provisions of the Government Corporation Control Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Government Corporation Control Act will continue to be applicable to the functions transferred by the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By transferring the remaining assets and liabilities of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to officers who conduct continuing programs involving similar functions, the plan will carry out the basic purposes not only of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Liquidation Act but also of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. The size of the Corporation’s portfolio has diminished to such a point that after June 30 it should not be necessary to maintain a separate agency solely for the purpose of administering the remaining assets. The plan will make possible a more economical administration of the Corporation’s functions by obviating the expense incident to maintaining a separate organization. It is not, however, practicable at this time to indicate more specifically the reduction of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of reorganizations contained in the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Incident to the abolition of the Corporation, the reorganization plan (1) abolishes the function of making the final report provided for in section 10 of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t15/s609">15 U.S.C. 609</ref>), and (2) provides for a final report to the Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury which is to reflect the affairs of the Corporation up to the date of abolition of the Corporation and is to be made not later than <date date="1959-06-30">June 30, 1959</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1957 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. The reorganization plan provides new arrangements for the conduct of Federal defense mobilization and civil defense functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In formulating Reorganization Plan No. 1, I have had the benefit of several studies made by the executive branch as well as those conducted by the Congress. The reorganization plan will overcome the major difficulties revealed by those studies and mentioned in my 1959 budget message where I made the following statement:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The structure of Federal organization for the planning, coordination, and conduct of our nonmilitary defense programs has been reviewed, and I have concluded that the existing statutes assigning responsibilities for the central coordination and direction of these programs are out of date. The rapid technical advances of military science have led to a serious overlap among agencies carrying on these leadership and planning functions. Because the situation will continue to change and because these functions transcend the responsibility of any single department or agency, I have concluded that they should be vested in no one short of the President. I will make recommendations to the Congress on this subject.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The principal effects of the organization plan are—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">First, it transfers to the President the functions vested by law in the Federal Civil Defense Administration and those so vested in the Office of Defense Mobilization. The result is to establish a single pattern with respect to the vesting of defense mobilization and civil defense functions. At the present time disparity exists in that civil defense functions are vested in the President only to a limited degree while a major part of the functions administered by the Office of Defense Mobilization are vested by law in the President and delegated by him to that Office. Under the plan, the broad program responsibilities for coordinating and conducting the interrelated defense mobilization and civil defense functions will be vested in the President for appropriate delegation as the rapidly changing character of the nonmilitary preparedness program warrants.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, the reorganization plan consolidates the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Civil Defense Administration to form a new Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization in the Executive Office of the President. I have concluded that, in many instances, the interests and activities of the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Civil Defense Administration overlap to such a degree that it is not possible to work out a satisfactory division of those activities and interests between the two agencies. I have also concluded that a single civilian mobilization agency of appropriate stature and authority is needed and that such an agency will ensue from the consolidation and from the granting of suitable authority to that agency for directing and coordinating the preparedness activities of the Federal departments and agencies and for providing unified guidance and assistance to the State and local governments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Third, the reorganization plan transfers the membership of the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization on the National Security Council to the Director of the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization and also transfers the Civil Defense Advisory Council to the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Initially, the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization will perform the civil defense and defense mobilization functions now performed by the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Civil Defense Administration. One of its first tasks will be to advise me with respect to the actions to be taken to clarify and expand the roles of the Federal departments and agencies in carrying out nonmilitary defense preparedness functions. After such actions are taken, the direction and coordination of the civil defense and defense mobilization activities assigned to the departments and agencies will comprise a principal remaining responsibility of the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of new officers specified in sections 2 and 3 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958 will immediately reduce the number of Federal agencies by one and, by providing sounder organizational arrangements for the administration of the affected functions, should promote the increased economy and effectiveness of the Federal expenditures concerned. It is, however, impracticable to itemize at this time the reduction of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I urge that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(a) In addition to its existing authority, the Federal Trade Commission, hereinafter referred to as the “Commission”, shall have the authority to delegate, by published order or rule, any of its functions to a division of the Commission, an individual Commissioner, a hearing examiner, or an employee or employee board, including functions with respect to hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting or otherwise acting as to any work, business, or matter: <i>Provided, however</i>, That nothing herein contained shall be deemed to supersede the provisions of section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (<ref href="/us/stat/60/241">60 Stat. 241</ref>), as amended [see <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s556">5 U.S.C. 556</ref>].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) With respect to the delegation of any of its functions, as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Commission shall retain a discretionary right to review the action of any such division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, hearing examiner, employee or employee board, upon its own initiative or upon petition of a party to or an intervenor in such action, within such time and in such manner as the Commission shall by rule prescribe: <i>Provided, however</i>, That the vote of a majority of the Commission less one member thereof shall be sufficient to bring any such action before the Commission for review.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(c) Should the right to exercise such discretionary review be declined, or should no such review be sought within the time stated in the rules promulgated by the Commission, then the action of any such division of the Commission, individual Commissioner, hearing examiner, employee or employee board, shall, for all purposes, including appeal or review thereof, be deemed to be the action of the Commission.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganization in the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1961 follows upon my message of <date date="1961-04-13">April 13, 1961</date>, to the Congress of the United States. It is believed that the taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan will provide for greater efficiency in the dispatch of the business of the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan provides for greater flexibility in the handling of the business before the Commission, permitting its disposition at different levels so as better to promote its efficient dispatch. Thus matters both of an adjudicatory and regulatory nature may, depending upon their importance and their complexity, be finally consummated by divisions of the Commission, individual Commissioners, hearing examiners, and, subject to the provisions of section 7(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (<ref href="/us/stat/60/241">60 Stat. 241</ref>), by other employees. This will relieve the Commissioners from the necessity of dealing with many matters of lesser importance and thus conserve their time for the consideration of major matters of policy and planning. There is, however, reserved to the Commission as a whole the right to review any such decision, report or certification either upon its own initiative or upon the petition of a party or intervenor demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Commission the desirability of having the matter reviewed at the top level.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Provision is also made, in order to maintain the fundamental bipartisan concept explicit in the basic statute creating the Commission, for mandatory review of any such decision, report or certification upon the vote of a majority of the Commission less one member.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Inasmuch as the assignment of delegated functions in particular cases and with reference to particular problems to divisions of the Commission, to Commissioners, to hearing examiners, to employees and boards of employees must require continuous and flexible handling, depending both upon the amount and nature of the business, that function is placed in the Chairman by section 2 of the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By providing sound organizational arrangements, the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the accompanying reorganization plan will make possible more economical and expeditious administration of the affected functions. It is, however, impracticable to itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(6) The preparation, review, and presentation to the Bureau of the Budget of the budget estimates of and other fund authorizations for the Board and the explanation and justification before the appropriate committees of the Congress of the budget estimates for the Board transmitted to the Congress by the President and of other fund authorizations placed before the Congress.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1961, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganizations in the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reorganization Plan No. 6 of 1961 relates to my message of <date date="1961-04-13">April 13, 1961</date>, to the Congress regarding regulatory agencies and, in particular, to that portion of the message advocating the fixing of responsibility for the overall administration of multiheaded agencies in their chairmen. The reorganization plan also is in keeping with actions begun by President Truman, largely through reorganization plans, to strengthen the internal management of multiheaded agencies by making their chairmen, rather than the boards or commissions as a whole, responsible for day-to-day administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The first Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government concluded that purely executive duties can be performed far better by a single administrative official and stated: “Administration by a plural executive is universally regarded as inefficient.” Also, as a matter of sound organization, the Congress and the President should be able to hold a single official rather than a group accountable for the effective management of an agency. The reorganization plan will meet both of those needs by placing responsibility and authority for the administration of the activities of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in the Chairman of the Board. By relieving the Board of day-to-day managerial functions, the reorganization plan will significantly further the ability of the Board to deal more effectively with regulatory and policy matters before it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Action to strengthen the management of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and to relieve the Board of day-to-day operating responsibility is particularly needed because of the phenomenal growth of the Board’s activities in recent years. By way of example, the number of institutions that are members of the Federal home loan bank system and subject to the Board’s supervision has increased from 3,898 in 1950 to 4,552 at present. In the same period the assets of those institutions have increased almost fivefold from $15.4 billion to $71 billion. In fiscal year 1950 the Board examined 2,450 institutions; in fiscal 1961 about 4,224 examinations will be conducted. The personnel of the Board have more than doubled in number in the last decade to handle the increased workload.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1947, the Chairman of the Home Loan Bank Board was made the chief executive officer of the Board, and there was transferred to him the authority to appoint and direct the personnel necessary to perform the functions of the Board, the Chairman, and the agencies under the Board. The Chairman’s authority with respect to personnel was returned to the whole Federal Home Loan Bank Board by the Housing Amendments of 1955. The reorganization plan herewith transmitted would restore that authority of the Chairman and further increase his management functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Specifically, the reorganization plan will transfer to the Chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board the Board’s functions with respect to the overall management, functioning, and organization of the agency; the appointment, removal, and direction of personnel; the distribution of business among, and communication of Board policies to, such personnel; and the enforcement of policies and the general improvement of staff support. There are also transferred to the Chairman functions relating to preparation, review, presentation, and justification of budget estimates and other fund authorizations and those relating to the allocation, use, and expenditure of funds available for administrative expenses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Nothing in the plan impinges upon the ability of the members of the Board to act independently with respect to substantive matters that come before them for decision, or to participate in the shaping of Board policies. In carrying out his managerial functions, the Chairman will be governed by the policies of the Board and the determinations it is authorized to make. The Board will have the authority to approve the Chairman’s appointments of the heads of major administrative units, and the other members of the Board will retain their present control over the personnel in their immediate offices.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for the reorganization of maritime functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The basic objective of the plan is to strengthen and revitalize the administration of our Federal programs concerned with the promotion and development of the U.S. merchant marine by concentrating responsibility in separate agencies for the performance of regulatory and promotional functions. The plan provides, therefore, for the creation of a separate Federal Maritime Commission, composed of five Commissioners, which would be charged with the regulatory functions of the present Federal Maritime Board. There would be transferred from the Federal Maritime Board to the Secretary of Commerce the award of subsidies and related promotional functions. The Secretary of Commerce would retain the functions transferred to him by Reorganization Plan No. 21 of 1950 which reorganized the U.S. Maritime Commission into a Federal Maritime Board and a Maritime Administration in the Department of Commerce. The plan retains the present Maritime Administration, provides for an Administrator as head thereof, retains a Deputy Maritime Administrator, and effects no change in the Office of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Transportation. The Federal Maritime Board is abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Existing organizational arrangements have not proved to be satisfactory. The development and maintenance of a sound maritime industry require that the Federal Government carry out its dual responsibilities for regulation and promotion with equal vigor and effectiveness. Intermingling of regulatory and promotional functions has tended in this instance to dilute responsibility and has led to serious inadequacies, particularly in the administration of regulatory functions. Recent findings by committees of the Congress disclose serious violations of maritime laws and point to the urgent need for a reorganization to vest in completely separate agencies a responsibility for (1) regulatory functions and (2) promotional and operating functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan would provide the most appropriate organizational framework for each of the functions concerned. Regulation would be made the exclusive responsibility of a separate commission organized along the general lines of other regulatory agencies. On the other hand, nonregulatory functions, including the determination and award of subsidies and other promotional and operating activities, would be concentrated in the head of the Department of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce is best qualified to coordinate these activities with other transportation and related economic programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The vesting of all subsidy functions in the Secretary of Commerce will make it possible for the Congress and the President to hold a single official responsible and accountable for the effective conduct of all aspects of this program, including the size and character of the fleet under the U.S. flag, the need for Government assistance, and requirements for appropriations to support subsidy programs. Furthermore, the placing of these functions in the Secretary of Commerce will assure essential supervision and review of subsidy awards.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in the accompanying reorganization plan will result in a modest increase in expenditures. The improved organizational alinements provided by the plan will, however, make possible a more effective and expeditious administration of the statutory objectives to foster and promote a U.S. merchant marine capable of meeting the Nation’s needs in peace and war. Failure to meet these objectives would be far more costly than the anticipated increase in expenditures under the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 7 of 1961 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of new officers specified in sections 102 and 201 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively, those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1962, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for certain reorganizations in the field of science and technology.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Part I of the reorganization plan establishes the Office of Science and Technology as a new unit within the Executive Office of the President; places at the head thereof a Director appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and makes provision for a Deputy Director similarly appointed; and transfers to the Director certain functions of the National Science Foundation under sections 3(a)(1) and 3(a)(6) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new arrangements incorporated in part I of the reorganization plan will constitute an important development in executive branch organization for science and technology. Under those arrangements the President will have permanent staff resources capable of advising and assisting him on matters of national policy affected by or pertaining to science and technology. Considering the rapid growth and far-reaching scope of Federal activities in science and technology, it is imperative that the President have adequate staff support in developing policies and evaluating programs in order to assure that science and technology are used most effectively in the interests of national security and general welfare.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To this end it is contemplated that the Director will assist the President in discharging the responsibility of the President for the proper coordination of Federal science and technology functions. More particularly, it is expected that he will advise and assist the President as the President may request with respect to—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(1) Major policies, plans, and programs of science and technology of the various agencies of the Federal Government, giving appropriate emphasis to the relationship of science and technology to national security and foreign policy, and measures for furthering science and technology in the Nation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(2) Assessment of selected scientific and technical developments and programs in relation to their impact on national policies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(3) Review, integration, and coordination of major Federal activities in science and technology, giving due consideration to the effects of such activities on non-Federal resources and institutions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(4) Assuring that good close relations exist with the Nation’s scientific and engineering communities so as to further in every appropriate way their participation in strengthening science and technology in the United States and the free world.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(5) Such other matters consonant with law as may be assigned by the President to the Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The ever-growing significance and complexity of Federal programs in science and technology have in recent years necessitated the taking of several steps for improving the organizational arrangements of the executive branch in relation to science and technology:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(1) The National Science Foundation was established in 1950. The Foundation was created to meet a widely recognized need for an organization to develop and encourage a national policy for the promotion of basic research and education in the sciences, to support basic research, to evaluate research programs undertaken by Federal agencies, and to perform related functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(2) The Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology was established in 1957. The Special Assistant serves as Chairman of both the President’s Science Advisory Committee and the Federal Council for Science and Technology, mentioned below.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(3) At the same time, the Science Advisory Committee, composed of eminent non-Government scientists and engineers, and located within the Office of Defense Mobilization, was reconstituted in the White House Office as the President’s Science Advisory Committee.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(4) The Federal Council for Science and Technology, composed of policy officials of the principal agencies engaged in scientific and technical activities, was established in 1959.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Science Foundation has proved to be an effective instrument for administering sizable programs in support of basic research and education in the sciences and has set an example for other agencies through the administration of its own programs. However, the Foundation, being at the same organizational level as other agencies, cannot satisfactorily coordinate Federal science policies or evaluate programs of other agencies. Science policies, transcending agency lines, need to be coordinated and shaped at the level of the Executive Office of the President drawing upon many resources both within and outside of Government. Similarly, staff efforts at that higher level are required for the evaluation of Government programs in science and technology.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Thus, the further steps contained in part I of the reorganization plan are now needed in order to meet most effectively new and expanding requirements brought about by the rapid and far-reaching growth of the Government’s research and development programs. These requirements call for the further strengthening of science organization at the Presidential level and for the adjustment of the Foundation’s role to reflect changed conditions. The Foundation will continue to originate policy proposals and recommendations concerning the support of basic research and education in the sciences, and the new Office will look to the Foundation to provide studies and information on which sound national policies in science and technology can be based.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Part I of the reorganization plan will permit some strengthening of the staff and consultant resources now available to the President in respect of scientific and technical factors affecting executive branch policies and will also facilitate communication with the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Part II of the reorganization plan provides for certain reorganizations within the National Science Foundation which will strengthen the capability of the Director of the Foundation to exert leadership and otherwise further the effectiveness of administration of the Foundation. Specifically:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(1) There is established a new office of Director of the National Science Foundation and that Director, ex officio, is made a member of the National Science Board on a basis coordinate with that of other Board members.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(2) There is substituted for the now-existing Executive Committee of the National Science Board a new Executive Committee composed of the Director of the National Science Foundation, ex officio, as a voting member and Chairman of the Committee, and of four other members elected by the National Science Board from among its appointive members.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(3) Committees advisory to each of the divisions of the Foundation will make their recommendations to the Director only rather than to both the Director and the National Science Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1962 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of the Director and Deputy Director of the Office of Science and Technology and of the Director of the National Science Foundation. The rate of compensation fixed for each of these officers is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions abolished by the provisions of section 23(b) of the reorganization plan are provided for in sections 4(a), 5(a), 6(a), 6(b), and 8(d) of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in the reorganization plan will provide sound organizational arrangements and will make possible more effective and efficient administration of Government programs in science and technology. It is, however, impracticable to itemize at this time the reductions in expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1963, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for the reorganization of certain functions relating to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The library project was built under authority of the joint resolution of <date date="1939-07-18">July 18, 1939</date>. It is located on a site in the town of Hyde Park, Dutchess County, N.Y., donated by the late Franklin D. Roosevelt. The library contains historical material donated by him, and other related historical material.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At the present time responsibility for the library is divided as follows:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(1) The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for the care, maintenance, and protection of the buildings and grounds of the library and for the collection of fees for the privilege of visiting and viewing the exhibit rooms or museum portion of the library, exclusive, however, of the function of fixing the amounts of fees charged.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(2) Responsibility for the contents and professional services of the library, and all other responsibility for the library except as indicated above, are vested in the Administrator of General Services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the transfer of functions with respect to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library from the Secretary of the Interior to the Administrator of General Services, as provided for in the reorganization plan transmitted herewith, becomes effective, the Administrator will have complete responsibility for the library, including its buildings, grounds, contents, and services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Three other Presidential libraries are now entirely under the jurisdiction of the Administrator of General Services (in pursuance of sec. 507(g) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended): the Harry S. Truman Library at Independence, Mo., the Herbert Hoover Library at West Branch, Iowa, and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library at Abilene, Kans. The taking effect of the provisions of the accompanying reorganization plan will place the administration of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library fully on a common footing with the administration of these three other Presidential libraries.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am persuaded that the present division of responsibility between the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of General Services is not conducive to the most efficient administration of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1963 will apply to this library the preferable pattern of organization existing with respect to other Presidential libraries.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1963 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The taking effect of reorganizations included in the reorganization plan will provide improved organizational arrangements with respect to the administration of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library. While such arrangements will further the convenient and efficient carrying out of the purposes of the library, it is impracticable to specify or itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Section 1. Abolition of Offices</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">All offices in the Bureau of Customs of the Department of the Treasury of collector of customs, comptroller of customs, surveyor of customs, and appraiser of merchandise to which appointments are required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, are abolished. The foregoing provisions shall become effective with respect to each office abolished thereby at such time, not later than <date date="1966-12-31">December 31, 1966</date>, as the Secretary of the Treasury shall specify, but nothing herein shall empower the Secretary to increase the term of any office beyond that provided by law for such office or affect his authority under the first paragraph under the heading “TREASURY DEPARTMENT” appearing in the Act of <date date="1895-03-02">March 2, 1895</date> (ch. 187, <ref href="/us/stat/28/844">28 Stat. 844</ref>; <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s252">5 U.S.C. 252</ref>) [<ref href="/us/usc/t31/s309">31 U.S.C. 309</ref>], to retain in office, prior to <date date="1966-12-31">December 31, 1966</date>, those persons whose offices are to be terminated under this reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 2. Transfer of Functions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There are transferred to the Secretary of the Treasury the functions, if any, that have been vested by statute in officers, agencies, or employees of the Bureau of Customs of the Department of the Treasury since the effective date of Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 (<ref href="/us/stat/64/1280">64 Stat. 1280</ref>).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 3. Preservation of Remedies</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The abolition of offices herein shall not prejudice any right to protest or to appeal to the United States Customs Court any action taken in the administration of the customs laws.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec 4. Incidental Provisions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Consonant with section 4 of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended [see <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s904">5 U.S.C. 904</ref>] and this reorganization plan, the Secretary of the Treasury shall make such provisions as he shall deem necessary respecting (1) the transfer or other disposition of the records, property, personnel, and unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds, available or to be made available, which are affected by a reorganization contained in this reorganization plan; and (2) the winding up of the affairs of any officer whose office is abolished by the provisions of this reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">All that we do to serve the people of this land must be done, as has been my insistent pledge, with the least cost and the most effectiveness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my state of the Union message, I announced it was this administration’s intention to “reshape and reorganize” the executive branch. This goal had one objective: “to meet more effectively the tasks of today.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I report today now one step taken forward toward that goal as part of our progress “on new economies we were planning to make.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I submit today a plan for reorganization in the Bureau of Customs of the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At present the Bureau maintains 113 independent field offices, each reporting directly to Customs headquarters in Washington, D.C. Under a modernization program of which this reorganization plan is an integral part, the Secretary of the Treasury proposes to establish six regional offices to supervise all Customs field activities. The tightened management controls achieved from these improvements will make possible a net annual saving of $9 million within a few years.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">An essential feature will be the abolition of the offices of all Presidential appointees in the Customs Service. The program cannot be effectively carried out without this step.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The following offices, therefore, would be eliminated: Collectors of customs, comptrollers of customs, surveyors of customs, and appraisers of merchandise, to which appointments are now required to be made by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Incumbents of abolished offices will be given consideration for suitable employment under the civil service laws in any positions in customs for which they may be qualified.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When this reorganization is completed, all officials and employees of the Bureau of Customs will be appointed under the civil service laws.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">All of the functions of the offices which will be abolished are presently vested in the Secretary of the Treasury by Reorganization Plan No. 26 of 1950 which gives the Secretary power to redelegate these functions. He will exercise this power as the existing offices are abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The estimate of savings that will be achieved by the program of customs modernization and improvement, of which this reorganization plan is a part, is based on present enforcement levels, business volume, and salary scales. Of the amounts saved, approximately $1 million a year will be from salaries no longer paid because of the abolition of offices.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proposed new organizational framework looks to the establishment of new offices at both headquarters and field levels and abolition of present offices.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This results in a net reduction of more than 50 separate principal field offices by concentration of supervisory responsibilities in fewer officials in charge of regional and district activities. In addition to the six offices of regional commissioner, about 25 offices of district director will be established. The regional commissioners and district directors will assume the overall principal supervisory responsibilities and functions of collectors of customs, appraisers of merchandise, comptrollers of customs, laboratories, and supervising customs agents.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At the headquarters level, four new offices will be established to replace seven divisions. A new position of special assistant to the Commissioner will be created and charged with responsibility for insuring that all Customs employees conduct themselves in strict compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Up to now this function has been one of a number lodged with an existing division.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1965 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It should be emphasized that abolition by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1965 of the offices of collector of customs, comptroller of customs, surveyor of customs, and appraiser of merchandise will in no way prejudice any right of any person affected by the laws administered by the Bureau of Customs. The rights of importers and others, for example, before the Customs Court, arising out of the administration of such functions will remain unaffected. In addition it should be emphasized that all essential services to the importing, exporting, and traveling public will continue to be performed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization plan will permit a needed modernization of the organization and procedure of the Bureau of Customs. It will permit a more effective administration of the customs laws.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I urge the Congress to permit Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1965 to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for the reorganization of two major agencies of the Department of Commerce: The Weather Bureau and the Coast and Geodetic Survey.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan consolidates the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Weather Bureau to form a new agency in the Department of Commerce to be known as the Environmental Science Services Administration. It is the intention of the Secretary of Commerce to transfer the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards to the Administration when the reorganization plan takes effect. The new Administration will then provide a single national focus for our efforts to describe, understand, and predict the state of the oceans, the state of the lower and upper atmosphere, and the size and shape of the earth.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Establishment of the Administration will mark a significant step forward in the continual search by the Federal Government for better ways to meet the needs of the Nation for environmental science services. The organizational improvements made possible by the reorganization plan will enhance our ability to develop an adequate warning system for the severe hazards of nature—for hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and seismic sea waves, which have proved so disastrous to the Nation in recent years. These improvements will permit us to provide better environmental information to vital segments of the Nation’s economy—to agriculture, transportation, communications, and industry, which continually require information about the physical environment. They will mean better services to other Federal departments and agencies—to those that are concerned with the national defense, the exploration of outer space, the management of our mineral and water resources, the protection of the public health against environmental pollution, and the preservation of our wilderness and recreation areas.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Administration will bring together a number of allied scientific disciplines that are concerned with the physical environment. This integration will better enable us to look at man’s physical environment as a scientific whole and to seek to understand the interactions among air, sea, and earth and between the upper and lower atmosphere. It will facilitate the development of programs dealing with the physical environment and will permit better management of these programs. It will enhance our capability to identify and solve important long-range scientific and technological problems associated with the physical environment. The new Administration will, in consequence, promote a fresh sense of scientific dedication, discovery, and challenge, which are essential if we are to attract scientists and engineers of creativity and talent to Federal employment in this field.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan provides for an Administrator at the head of the Administration, and for a Deputy Administrator, each of whom will be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. As authorized by the civil service and other laws and regulations, subordinate officers of the Administration will be appointed by the Secretary of Commerce or be assigned by him from among a corps of commissioned officers. The Administration will perform such functions as the Secretary of Commerce may delegate or otherwise assign to it and will be under his direction and control.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey will become commissioned officers of the Administration and may serve at the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce throughout the Administration. The reorganization plan authorizes the President at his discretion to fill the Office of Deputy Administrator by appointment, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, from the active list of commissioned officers of the Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan transmitted herewith abolishes—and thus excludes from the consolidation mentioned above—the offices of (1) Chief of the Weather Bureau, provided for in the act of <date date="1890-10-01">October 1, 1890</date> (<ref href="/us/usc/t15/s312">15 U.S.C. 312</ref>); (2) Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, provided for in the acts of <date date="1920-06-04">June 4, 1920</date>, and <date date="1929-02-16">February 16, 1929</date>, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t33/s852">33 U.S.C. 852</ref>, 852a); and (3) Deputy Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, provided for in the act of <date date="1942-01-19">January 19, 1942</date>, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t33/s852b">33 U.S.C. 852b</ref>).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby delcare that by reason of the reorganizations made by the reorganization plan, it is necessary to include in the plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the officers of the Administration set forth in section 4 of the reorganization plan. The rate of compensation fixed for each of these officers is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to permitting more effective management within the Department of Commerce, the new organization will ultimately produce economies. These economies will be of two types. The first, and probably the most significant, is the savings and avoidance of costs which will result from the sharing of complex and expensive facilities such as satellites, computers, communication systems, aircraft, and ships. These economies will increase in significance as developments in science and technology bring into being still more advanced equipment. Second, integration of the existing headquarters and field organizations will permit more efficient utilization of existing administrative staffs and thereby produce future economies. It is, however, impracticable to specify or itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the accompanying reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1965, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganizations of various committees and other similar bodies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The strength and vitality of our democracy depends in major part upon the Federal Government’s adaptability, on its capacity for fast flexible response to changing needs imposed by changing circumstances. If we are to maintain this capacity, we must have a government that is streamlined and capable of quickly adjusting and readjusting its organization and operating procedures to take up and surmount new challenges.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As government grows more complex and programs increasingly cut across traditional agency lines, we must exercise special care to prevent the continuance of obsolete interagency committees and other coordinating devices which waste time and delay action and the undue proliferation of new committees. Interagency committees are a valuable and often indispensable means for facilitating coordination, but we should be sure that a committee is the most efficient way to accomplish a given task and that it is structured to meet current needs effectively.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At my direction, guidelines for the management of interagency committees have been established. I have recently asked the heads of departments and agencies to give their personal attention to a complete review of all the interagency committees in which their agencies participate to determine which ones might be eliminated, consolidated or otherwise reorganized. We will take appropriate action to obtain essential improvements in the organization and use of those committees which have been established by the executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations accomplished by the reorganization plan transmitted herewith will enable us to take similar action with respect to a number of committees which have been established by statute. In many instances the statutory provisions creating these committees are very specific as to membership and describe in detail the functions to be performed. These provisions are rarely sufficiently flexible to permit the membership or role of the committees to be accommodated to changing circumstances or to permit their termination when they have outlived their usefulness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The accompanying reorganization plan will abolish nine statutory committees. In each case the responsibility for providing suitable arrangements to assure effective consultation and coordination is placed in a specific official. Wherever the continuing need for and usefulness of a committee has been demonstrated, I would anticipate the establishment of a successor committee along he general lines of the body now provided by law. Certainly prompt action will be taken to create successor committees to such bodies as the Board of Foreign Service and the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems. But we will have the flexibility promptly to make such changes in functions and membership as might be required to eliminate overlapping and duplication and to adjust to the development of new programs and shifts in executive branch responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A number of the committees affected by the reorganization plan are advisory to the President or have functions which are closely related to responsibilities already vested in the President. The functions of those committees will be transferred to the President by the reorganization plan. The functions of the others will be transferred to the appropriate individual agency heads.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The management and control of interagency committees have been a matter of growing concern to both the executive branch and the Congress. The taking effect of the reorganization plan will contribute significantly to better management of interagency committees and will assist efforts to simplify and modernize coordinating arrangements within the executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Executive Order No. 10940 of <date date="1961-05-11">May 11, 1961</date>, provides for the President’s Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is required to consult with that committee on matters of general policy and procedure arising in the administration of the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act of 1961 and to consider certain recommendations of that committee (<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s2546/b">42 U.S.C. 2546(b)</ref>). To require the Secretary by law to consult with a committee established by Executive order is clearly anomalous. The plan abolishes the relevant functions of the Secretary with respect to consulting and considering the recommendations of the President’s Committee. The reorganization plan does not otherwise affect the Committee; it has no effect upon Executive Order No. 10940. The statutory authority for the exercise of the functions to be abolished by section 13(b) of the reorganization plan is contained in section 7(b) of the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act of 1961 (<ref href="/us/stat/75/574">75 Stat. 574</ref>).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1965 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although the reorganizations provided for in the reorganization plan will not of themselves result in immediate savings, the improvement achieved in administration will in the future allow the performance of the affected functions at lower costs and in a more timely manner than at present. It is, however, impracticable to specify or itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the accompanying reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1965, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for certain reorganizations relating to the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan contains two reorganization measures. First, all committees provided for in section 8 of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 would be abolished. That section provides that there shall be a committee for each division of the Foundation, having not less than five members who are appointed by the National Science Board for 2-year terms. Section 8, as affected by section 23(b)(3) of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1962 (<ref href="/us/stat/76/1255">76 Stat. 1255</ref>), directs each such committee to make recommendations to and advise and consult with the Director of the National Science Foundation with respect to matters relating to the program of its division. Originally the Foundation had three such committees, corresponding to its three divisions. With the growth of the Foundation, five additional divisions have been established; consequently the Foundation, in accordance with the requirements of section 8, now has eight divisional committees. This multiplication in the number of committees has proved cumbersome. For example, three committees are now concerned with scientific personnel and education matters instead of the original one committee, even though one committee is all that is required to meet the Foundation’s needs in this area. The elimination of the various statutory divisional committees will simplify the structure of the Foundation and improve its administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The second reorganization measure contained in the accompanying reorganization plan would empower the Director of the National Science Foundation to delegate functions vested in him by law or delegated to him by the National Science Board. The expanding responsibilities of the Foundation and the Director indicate that it is necessary that the Director clearly have such authority.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Upon the taking effect of the reorganization plan, the National Science Foundation will institute such new arrangements, in lieu of the divisional committees now required by law, as it deems appropriate. Such new arrangements may include the establishment of committees under section 6 of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950 and such other devices for obtaining advice as may be available to the Foundation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the reorganization plan transmitted herewith is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan will permit more effective management of the affairs of the National Science Foundation. It is, however, impracticable to specify or itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The statutory authority for the exercise of certain functions which would be abolished by section 1 of the reorganization plan is contained in section 8 of the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, 64 Stat, 152.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Subject to the provisions of this reorganization plan, the Community Relations Service now existing in the Department of Commerce under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Pub.

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">All functions of the Community Relations Service, and all functions of the Director of the Community Relations Service, together with all functions of the Secretary of Commerce and the Department of Commerce with respect thereto, are hereby transferred to the Attorney General.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 3. Incidental Transfers</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(a) Section 1 hereof shall be deemed to transfer to the Department of Justice the personnel, property, and records of the Community Relations Service and the unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, and other funds available or to be made available to the Service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) Such further measures and dispositions as the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall deem to be necessary in order to effectuate the transfers referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be carried out in such manner as he shall direct and by such agencies as he shall designate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganization of community relations functions in the area of civil rights.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After a careful review of the activities of the Federal agencies involved in the field of civil rights, it became clear that the elimination of duplication and undesirable overlap required the consolidation of certain functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As a first step, I issued Executive Orders 11246 and 11247 on <date date="1965-09-24">September 24, 1965</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Executive Order 11246 simplified and clarified executive branch assignments of responsibility for enforcing civil rights policies and placed responsibility for the Government-wide coordination of the enforcement activities of executive agencies in the Secretary of Labor with respect to employment by Federal contractors and in the Civil Service Commission with respect to employment by Federal agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Executive Order 11247 directed the Attorney General to assist Federal agencies in coordinating their enforcement activities with respect to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in federally assisted programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As a further step for strengthening the operation and coordination of our civil rights programs, I now recommend transfer of the functions of the Community Relations Service, established in the Department of Commerce under title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to the Attorney General and transfer of the Service, including the Office of Director, to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Community Relations Service was located in the Department of Commerce by the Congress on the assumption that a primary need would be the conciliation of disputes arising out of the public accommodations title of the act. That decision was appropriate on the basis of information available at that time. The need for conciliation in this area has not been as great as anticipated because of the voluntary progress that has been made by businessmen and business organizations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To be effective, assistance to communities in the identification and conciliation of disputes should be closely and tightly coordinated. Thus, in any particular situation that arises within a community, representatives of Federal agencies whose programs are involved should coordinate their efforts through a single agency. In recent years, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department has played such a coordinating role in many situations, and has done so with great effectiveness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Placing the Community Relations Service within the Justice Department will enhance the ability of the Justice Department to mediate and conciliate and will insure that the Federal Government speaks with a unified voice in those tense situations where the good offices of the Federal Government are called upon to assist.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In this, as in other areas of Federal operations, we will move more surely and rapidly toward our objectives if we improve Federal organization and the arrangements for interagency coordination. The accompanying reorganization plan has that purpose.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present distribution of Federal civil rights responsibilities clearly indicates that the activities of the Community Relations Service will fit most appropriately in the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of Justice has primary program responsibilities in civil rights matters and deep and broad experience in the conciliation of civil rights disputes. Congress has assigned it a major role in the implementation of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Department of Justice performs related functions under other acts of Congress. Most of these responsibilities require not only litigation, but also efforts at persuasion, negotiation, and explanation, especially with local governments and law enforcement authorities. In addition, under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act the Department will be supporting local programs in the area of police-community relations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The test of the effectiveness of an enforcement agency is not how many legal actions are initiated and won, but whether there is compliance with the law. Thus, every such agency necessarily engages in extensive efforts to obtain compliance with the law and the avoidance of disputes. In fact, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires each agency concerned to attempt to obtain compliance by voluntary means before taking further action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Among the heads of Cabinet departments the President looks principally to the Attorney General for advice and judgment on civil rights issues. The latter is expected to be familiar with civil rights problems in all parts of the Nation and to make recommendations for executive and legislative action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Attorney General already has responsibility with respect to a major portion of Federal conciliation efforts in the civil rights field. Under Executive Order 11247, he coordinates the Government-wide enforcement of title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which relies heavily on the achievement of compliance through persuasion and negotiation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the light of these facts, the accompanying reorganization plan would transfer the functions of the Community Relations Service and of its Director to the Attorney General. In so providing, the plan, of course, follows the established pattern of Federal organization by vesting all the transferred powers in the head of the department. The Attorney General will provide for the organization of the Community Relations Service as a separate unit within the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions transferred by the reorganization plan would be carried out with full regard for the provisions of section 1003 of title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 relating to (1) cooperation with appropriate State or local, public, or private agencies; (2) the confidentiality of information acquired with the understanding that it would be so held; and (3) the limitation on the performance of investigative or prosecutive functions by personnel of the Service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This transfer will benefit both the Department of Justice and the Community Relations Service in the fulfillment of their existing functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Attorney General will benefit in his role as the President’s adviser by obtaining an opportunity to anticipate and meet problems before the need for legal action arises.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Community Relations Service, brought into closer relationship with the Attorney General and the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, will gain by becoming a primary resource in a coordinated effort in civil rights under the leadership of the Attorney General. The Community Relations Service will have direct access to the extensive information, experience, staff, and facilities within the Department and in other Federal agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Finally, the responsibility for coordinating major Government activities under the Civil Rights Act aimed at voluntary and peaceful resolution of discriminatory practices will be centered in one department. Thus, the reorganization will permit the most efficient and effective utilization of resources in this field. Together the Service and the Department will have a larger capacity for accomplishment than they do apart.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although the reorganizations provided for in the reorganization plan will not of themselves result in immediate savings, the improvement achieved in administration will permit a fuller and more effective utilization of manpower and will in the future allow the performance of the affected functions at lower costs than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each organization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1966 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganization of certain water pollution control functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Thirty-five years ago Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said: “A river is more than an amenity, it is a treas­ure.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Only recently has the truth of this observation entered the public conscience. For we now recognize that the Nation’s rivers, far from being treasured, have been carelessly neglected for too long.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today we face a harsh reality. Our waters are burdened with blight. We know that every river system in America suffers from some degree of pollution. This menace is growing more serious with every passing day.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We have just begun to take the steps to clean and restore our waters.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The task is immense. The journey will be long.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If our new programs are to succeed we must combine our efforts—Federal, State, local, and private—in new and creative partnerships.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The attack against water pollution should be unified and coordinated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It should be carried forward as an integral part of comprehensive planning for the development of river basins.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But, most importantly, the Government’s management structure must be strengthened and reshaped to meet the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my February 23 message on the quality of our environment I stated:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">“* * * we must reorganize the Federal effort. In the past, the Federal anti-pollution effort has been organizationally separate from water conservation and use programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">“One agency should assume leadership in our clean water effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">“That agency should be the Department of the Interior.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of the Interior, for many years, has been concerned with the comprehensive management and development of the Nation’s water resources.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It plans, constructs, and operates multiple-purpose water and related land resources, projects.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It carries on research and development on the removal of minerals from water.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It administers the Water Resources Research Act.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Secretary of the Interior also serves as Chairman of the Water Resources Council responsible for coordinating river basin planning. Under the Clean Rivers Restoration Act of 1966 and other legislation which I have recently proposed, the Secretary will become the focal point for Federal efforts in this area.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is wise management to place under his control the related resources and authority now in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan maintains a proper and effective role for the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare with respect to the health aspects of pollution. At the same time it places in the Department of the Interior all of the necessary tools to move forward the drive to clean America’s waters.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan herewith transmitted will transfer to the Secretary of the Interior the functions of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act except for responsibilities relating to public health for which the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has special competence. That Department will retain responsibility under section 3(b) of the act for advising on public health questions involved in determinations by Federal agencies of the need for and value of the inclusion of storage for water quality control in Federal reservoirs. The Federal Water Pollution Control Administration would be transferred to the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Secretary of the Interior in administering the act will also be required to consult with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on public health aspects relating to water pollution. This consultative responsibility is now vested in the Surgeon General by section 2(k) of the Water Quality Act of 1965. The plan transfers that responsibility to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Water Pollution Control Advisory Board and the hearing boards provided for in the act would be transferred to the Department of the Interior, together with their respective functions. The reorganization plan also makes the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare a member of the Advisory Board and gives him the opportunity to select a member of each hearing board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan would in no way impair the rights and benefits of commissioned officers of the Public Health Service who may transfer to the Water Pollution Control Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization to be accomplished by the plan transmitted herewith will enable the Federal Government to organize for action against pollution on a river basin basis under the unified leadership of the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of the reorganizations made thereby, provision for the membership of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare on the Water Pollution Control Advisory Board and for the appointment and compensation of an additional Assistant Secretary of the Interior. The rate of compensation fixed for that officer is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations provided for in the reorganization plan transmitted herewith will produce significant long-range savings and economies by reason of the efficiencies in organization and in the elimination of duplication of effort it will bring about. It is, however, impracticable to specify or itemize at this time the reductions of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by the taking effect of the reorganizations included in the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the accompanying plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganization of health functions of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">I</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today we face new challenges and unparalleled opportunities in the field of health. Building on the progress of the past several years, we have truly begun to match the achievements our medicine to the needs of our people.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The task ahead is immense. As a nation, we will unceasingly pursue our research and learning, our training and building, our testing and treatment. But now our concern must also turn to the organization of our Federal health programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As citizens we are entitled to the very best health services our resources can provide.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As taxpayers, we demand the most efficient and economic health organizations that can be devised.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I ask Congress to approve a reorganization plan to bring new strength to the administration of Federal health programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose a series of changes in the organization of the Public Health Service that will bring to all Americans a structure modern in design, more efficient in operation and better prepared to meet the great and growing needs of the future. Through such improvements we can achieve the full promise of the landmark health legislation enacted by the 89th Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I do not propose these changes lightly. They follow a period of careful deliberation. For many months the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Surgeon General have consulted leading experts in the Nation—physicians, administrators, scientists, and public health specialists. They have confirmed my belief that modernization and reorganization of the Public Health Service are urgently required and long overdue.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">II</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Public Health Service is an operating agency of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It is the principal arm of the Federal Government in the field of health. Its programs are among those most vital to our well-being.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since 1953 more than 50 new programs have been placed in the Public Health Service. Its budget over the past 12 years has increased tenfold—from $250 million to $2.4 billion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today the organization of the Public Health Service is clearly obsolete. The requirement that new and expanding programs be administered through an organizational structure established by law more than two decades ago stands as a major obstacle to the fulfillment of our Nation’s health goals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As presently constituted, the Public Health Service is composed of four major components:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Bureau of State Services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Bureau of Medical Services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Office of the Surgeon General.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">Under present law, Public Health Service functions must be assigned only to these four components.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This structure was designed to provide separate administrative arrangements for health research, programs of State and local aid, health services, and executive staff resources. At a time when these functions could be neatly compartmentalized, the structure was adequate. But today the situation is different.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under recent legislation many new programs provide for an integrated attack on specific disease problems or health hazards in the environment by combining health services, State and local aid, and research. Each new program of this type necessarily is assigned to one of the three operating components of the Public Health Service. Yet none of these components is intended to administer programs involving such a variety of approaches.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Our health problems are difficult enough without having them complicated by outmoded organizational arrangements.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But if we merely take the step of integrating the four agencies within the Public Health Service we will not go far enough. More is required.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">III</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare performs major health or health-related functions which are not carried out through the Public Health Service, although they are closely related to its functions. Among these are:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Health insurance for the aged, administered through the Social Security Administration;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Medical assistance for the needy, administered through the Welfare Administration;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Regulation of the manufacture, labeling, and distribution of drugs, carried out through the Food and Drug Administration; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Grants-in-aid to States for vocational rehabilitation of the handicapped, administered by the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Expenditures for health and health-related programs of the Department administered outside the Public Health Service have increased from $44 million in 1953 to an estimated $5.4 billion in 1967.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As the head of the Department, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is responsible for the administration and coordination of all the Department’s health functions. He has clear authority over the programs I have just mentioned.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But today he lacks this essential authority over the Public Health Service. The functions of that agency are vested in the Surgeon General and not in the Secretary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This diffusion of responsibility is unsound and unwise.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To secure the highest possible level of health services for the American people the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare must be given the authority to establish— and modify as necessary—the organizational structure for Public Health Service programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">He must also have the authority to coordinate health functions throughout the Department. The reorganization plan I propose will accomplish these purposes. It will provide the Secretary with the flexibility to create new and responsive organizational arrangements to keep pace with the changing and dynamic nature of our health programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">My views in this respect follow a basic principle of good government set by the Hoover Commission in 1949 when it recommended that “the Department head should be given authority to determine the organization within his Department.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">IV</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In summary, the reorganization plan would:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Transfer to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare the functions now vested in the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service and in its various subordinate units (this transfer will not affect certain statutory advisory bodies such as the National Advisory Cancer and Heart Councils);</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Abolish the four principal statutory components of the Public Health Service, including the offices held by their heads (the Bureau of Medical Services, the Bureau of State Services, the National Institutes of Health exclusive of its several research institutes such as the National Cancer and Heart Institutes, and the Office of the Surgeon General); and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Authorize the Secretary to assign the functions transferred to him by the plan to officials and entities of the Public Health Service and to other agencies of the Department as he deems appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">Thus, the Secretary would be—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Enabled to assure that all health functions of the Department are carried out as effectively and economically as possible;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Given authority commensurate with his responsibility; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Made responsible in fact for matters for which he is now, in any case, held accountable by the President, the Congress, and the people.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">V</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Should the reorganizations in the accompanying reorganization plan take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of the affected health programs. It is, however, not practicable at this time to itemize the reductions in expenditures which may result.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I strongly recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for a reorganization relating to the National Zoological Park located in the District of Columbia.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today, all responsibilities for the administration of the park are vested in the Smithsonian Institution with one exception—the function of preparing plans and specifications for the construction of buildings and bridges at the zoo. That statutory responsibility is now conducted by the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the accompanying reorganization plan, the responsibility for the preparation of these plans and specifications would be transferred from the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners to the Smithsonian. The complete administration of the park would then be vested in one agency—the Smithsonian Institution. This will allow the more efficient and effective development and management of the park.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In 1912, the functions to be transferred were vested in the Municipal Architect of the District of Columbia and in the Engineers of the Bridges of the District of Columbia. In 1952, they were transferred to the Board of Commissioners.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the 1912 act was passed, the District of Columbia shared the costs of capital improvements in the National Zoological Park. In 1961, it ceased sharing these costs, and the Federal Government assumed, complete responsibility for financing the improvements. Accordingly, the District government retains no capital improvement responsibilities for the National Zoological Park except those functions relating to construction plans and specifications for buildings and bridges, as specified in the 1912 statutes. Upon the transfer of these remaining functions to the Smithsonian Institution, the administration of the National Zoological Park will, at last, be fully centered in one agency. It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the resulting reduction in expenditures.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 2. Liquidation</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Capital Planning Commission shall make such provisions as it shall deem necessary respecting the winding up of the outstanding affairs of the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The time has come to recognize the readiness of local governments in the Washington area to undertake a role which is properly and rightfully theirs. To that end, I am submitting a reorganization plan to abolish the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Comprehensive regional planning is vital to the orderly development of our metropolitan areas. Nowhere is it more important than in the National Capital region.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To be most effective, regional planning must be a responsibility of the area’s State and local governments acting together to solve mutual problems of growth and change. It should not be a Federal function, although the Federal Government should support and advance it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The need for cooperative planning was recognized years ago in the National Capital region. The establishment of the National Capital Regional Planning Council in 1952 to prepare a comprehensive development plan was a major step in meeting that need.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">However, the Council was designed for conditions which no longer exist. It was established by Federal law as a Federal agency financed by Federal funds because the various local jurisdictions then felt they were not in a position to provide the financing necessary for areawide comprehensive planning.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The situation that existed in 1952 has been changed by two major developments—</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">The founding of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">The inauguration of a nationwide urban planning assistance program, commonly referred to as the “701 Program.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, established in 1957, is a voluntary association of elected officials of local governments in the area. It has a competent professional staff and has done constructive work on areawide development matters. It had a budget of nearly a quarter of a million dollars for fiscal year 1965, mostly derived from local government contributions, and has developed to the point where it can fully carry out the State and local aspects of regional planning.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The urban planning assistance program provides for Federal financing of two-thirds of the cost of metropolitan planning. The National Capital Regional Planning Council, as a Federal agency, is not eligible for assistance under this program. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, however, became eligible for that assistance under the terms of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. Accordingly, the elected local governments of the National Capital region have declared their intention of undertaking the responsibility for area-wide comprehensive planning through the Council of Governments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan will not alter the basic responsibilities of the National Capital Planning Commission. That Commission will continue to represent the Federal interest in the planning and development of the region. Indeed, its work should increase as comprehensive regional planning by the Council of Governments is accelerated. In accord with the reorganization plan, the Commission will work closely with the Council of Governments in regional planning. The Commission will also deal directly with the suburban jurisdictions and assume the liaison functions now exercised by the National Capital Regional Planning Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan will improve existing organizational arrangements of and promote more effective and efficient planning for the National Capital region.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It will also result in long-range savings to the Federal Government. The regional planning effort of the Council of Governments is supported in part by local contributions. The same work done by the National Capital Regional Planning Council has been supported totally with Federal funds. The plan will eliminate this overlapping effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Annual savings of at least $25,000 should result from the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions to be abolished by the reorganization plan are provided for in sections 2(e), 3, 4, 5(d), and 6(b) of the act approved <date date="1924-06-06">June 6, 1924</date>, entitled “An Act providing for a comprehensive development of the park and playground system of the National Capital” (<ref href="/us/stat/43/463">43 Stat. 463</ref>), as amended (<ref href="/us/stat/66/783">66 Stat. 783</ref>, [former] <ref href="/us/usc/t40/s71a/e">40 U.S.C. 71a(e)</ref>, 71b, 71c, 71d(d), and 71e(b)) [now, in part, <ref href="/us/usc/t40/s8711/e">40 U.S.C. 8711(e)</ref>, 8721(a), (e), 8722(c)].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 to provide a better government for the citizens of the Nation’s Capital.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The explosive growth of the District of Columbia challenges the city on every front—from schools and hospitals, courts and police, to housing and transportation, recreation and job opportunities. If the District is to meet these tests and fulfill the needs of its citizens, it must, as I said in my message on the National Capital, “have the most responsive and efficient government we are capable of providing.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan I submit today is more than a matter of routine reorganization. Its vital purpose is to bring Twentieth Century government to the Capital of this Nation: to strengthen and modernize the government of the District of Columbia; to make it as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present form of District government was designed almost a century ago for a community of 150,000 people. The District government then employed less than 500 persons and administered a budget of less than four million dollars.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today Washington has a population of 800,000. It is the center of the country’s fastest growing metropolitan area with a population of 2.5 million. The District’s Government now employs some 30,000 people and the proposed 1968 budget is more than half a billion dollars.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The machinery designed more than 90 years ago to govern a small community is now obsolete. The commission form of government—unorthodox when the Congress accepted it as a temporary measure in 1874—provides neither effective nor efficient government for the Nation’s Capital. That form of government has long since been abandoned by the few cities which adopted it around the turn of the century. Today none of the Nation’s 27 largest cities and only two of the country’s 47 cities with populations exceeding 300,000 have a government of divided authority.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The District of Columbia is governed by three Commissioners. Each Commissioner is the chief executive—the mayor—but for only a part of the government. Yet, the problems of the District of Columbia, like those of any major city, cannot be neatly broken into three parts. Any effort to control crime, for example, cuts across virtually every function of government—from police and corrections to housing, education, health and employment. An effective attack on the problem requires action by two or more Commissioners and the Departments for which they are separately responsible—a time-consuming and often costly process.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The District has been fortunate in the caliber and dedication of the men who have served as Commissioners, but it can no longer afford divided executive authority. Its government must be able to respond promptly and effectively to new demands and new conditions. This requires clear-cut executive authority and flexible government machinery—not divided authority which too often results in prolonged negotiations and inaction.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The problem of divided executive authority in the District is aggravated by the additional non-executive responsibilities now borne by the Commissioners. As a member of the Board of Commissioners, each must now make rules and regulations on matters with which he is not otherwise concerned as an executive. Some of these quasi-legislative responsibilities—such as police regulations and property taxation—are of great importance to the city. Many—such as the naming of streets and the labeling of potato packages—are merely time-consuming. None should require a substantial portion of the time of the chief executive of a major city.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan I propose would remedy these deficiencies in the present form of government. It would:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Unify executive and administrative authority.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Eliminate competing and sometimes conflicting assignments of responsibility.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Provide for the informed exercise of quasi-legislative functions through a Council which would be bipartisan and representative of the community.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Permit the single Commissioner to organize the District government to provide effective day-to-day administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the plan, subject to Senate confirmation, the President would appoint a single Commissioner as chief executive and a bipartisan Council of nine members. The Commissioner would serve a four-year term, corresponding to that of the President. Council members would serve three-year terms, with three members to be appointed each year. The staggered terms would insure continuity of experience on the Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan would abolish the present Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia. Its powers and responsibilities would be apportioned between the single Commissioner and the Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Commissioner would be assigned the executive functions now vested in the Board of Commissioners. He would be given responsibility and authority to organize and manage the District government, to administer its programs and to prepare its budget. The plan also provides for an Assistant to the Commissioner to help him carry out these responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Council would be assigned the quasi-legislative functions now performed by the Board of Commissioners. The plan describes more than 430 functions which would be transferred to the Council. These include major responsibilities such as the approval of boundaries and plans for urban renewal, establishment of rules governing the licensing of professions, and setting of rates for property taxation. The Council would also be empowered to review and revise the Commissioner’s budget before submission to the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Since the plan was announced in my Message on the Nation’s Capital, we have been working to strengthen the Office of Commissioner and the Council. Out of this process of refinement four key changes have emerged, and have been incorporated into the plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">First, the plan would authorize the Commissioner to veto actions of the Council with which he disagrees. The Council, in turn, could override such a veto by a three-fourths vote of its members. This provides due recognition for the responsibilities of the chief executive, while at the same time preserving the right of the Council to act on matters of overriding importance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, the terms of Council members would be set at three years instead of two. The reduction in turnover and increase in experience would add strength to the Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Third, the salaries of the Chairman, Vice Chairman and Council members would be increased to reflect their important responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Finally, the plan recognizes that the machinery of the District’s government, no matter how modern, cannot realize its highest purpose unless it is infused with the most experienced, informed and able leadership.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The 800,000 citizens of the District of Columbia deserve nothing less than such leadership, not only as a matter of fundamental right but because the District occupies a special and central role in the affairs of the Nation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The best talent available must be found for the key posts of Commissioner and Assistant to the Commissioner. The Commissioner is the chief executive of the District of Columbia. The Assistant to the Commissioner will be his chief aide, his deputy, and will perform such duties as the Commissioner may prescribe.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the search for leadership necessary in these crucial posts, the President and the Congress must balance the need to draw from the best talent in the Nation with the need for local experience and local involvement that are such valuable assets to enlightened municipal government. The plan therefore provides for the Presidential appointment of both these men, subject to Senate confirmation, with the requirement that at least one of them to be a resident of the District for three years prior to appointment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We would be indifferent to the cause of good government if the search and selection of the Commissioner and his Assistant were confined only to those who reside within the geographic boundaries of the District. This plan does not take that course. It provides a wide range of choice—opening the field not only to those who reside in the District, but to those who live in other parts of the Nation. At the same time, the plan assures that local experience will be well represented in the highest councils of the District Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Not only must either of the top executive positions be filled with a District resident, but each member of the nine-man Council must have been a resident of the District for at least three years prior to appointment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Moreover, in selecting the Commissioner, I will look first to the residents of the District and I hope that he can be found here.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Of all the benefits of the plan, one stands out in particular—the strong leadership it provides as the cornerstone of support for any effective attack against crime. With that leadership and with the continued commitment and devotion of its police, the District can move with a greater sense of sureness and purpose against the spectre of crime that haunts the streets and shops of the Nation’s Capital.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Of all the duties of the new single Commissioner none will be more important than his leadership in a renewed community effort to stem the rising tide of crime in the District.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. At my direction, it has been discussed with each member of the interested Committees of Congress or with their Staff Assistants. I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have also found that it is necessary to include in the plan, by reason of the reorganization made, provisions for the appointment and compensation of the new officers specified in sections 201, 203 and 301–303 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch of the Government having similar responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions which would be abolished by the provisions of section 503(c) of the reorganization plan are provided for in subsection (e) of <ref href="/us/act/1925-03-03/s6">Section 6 of the Act of March 3, 1925</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/43/1121">43 Stat. 1121</ref>, as amended (D.C. Code, sec. 40–603(e)).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan would not impair the corporate status of the District of Columbia government. Nor would it in any way detract from the powers which the Congress exercises with respect to the District.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization plan would provide improved management of the municipal responsibilities vested by Congress in the government of the District of Columbia. It would bring savings to the District taxpayers and the Federal Government, although overall costs will not be less because of the increasing scale and complexity of municipal government. The precise amount of such savings cannot be itemized at this time.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proposed reorganization is in no way a substitute for home rule. As I stated in my Message on the Nation’s Capital, the plan will give the District a better organized and more efficient government . . . but only home rule will provide the District with a democratic government—of, by and for its citizens.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I remain convinced more strongly than ever that Home Rule is still the truest course. We must continue to work toward that day—when the citizens of the District will have the right to frame their own laws, manage their own affairs, and choose their own leaders. Only then can we redeem that historic pledge to give the District of Columbia full membership in the American Union.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With this action, America will serve notice to the pusher and the peddler that their criminal acts must stop.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">No matter how well organized they are, we will be better organized. No matter how well they have concealed their activities, we will root them out.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today, Federal investigation and enforcement of our narcotics laws are fragmented. One major element—the Bureau of Narcotics—is in the Treasury Department and responsible for the control of marihuana and narcotics such as heroin. Another—the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control—is in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and is responsible for the control of dangerous drugs including depressants, stimulants, and hallucinogens such as LSD.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Neither is located in the agency which is primarily concerned with Federal law enforcement—the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This separation of responsibilities—despite the relentless and dedicated efforts of the agents of each Bureau—has complicated and hindered our response to a national menace.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">For example, more than nine out of ten seizures of LSD made by the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control have also turned up marihuana—but that Bureau has no jurisdiction over marihuana.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In many instances, we are confronted by well organized, disciplined and resourceful criminals who reap huge profits at the expense of their unfortunate victims.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The response of the Federal Government must be unified. And it must be total.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today, in my Message on Crime, I recommended strong new laws to control dangerous drugs. I also recommended an increase of more than thirty percent in the number of Federal agents enforcing the narcotic and dangerous drug laws.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I now propose that a single Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs be established in the Department of Justice to administer those laws and to bring to the American people the most efficient and effective Federal enforcement machinery we can devise.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under this Reorganization Plan the Attorney General will have full authority and responsibility for enforcing the Federal laws relating to narcotics and dangerous drugs. The new Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, to be headed by a Director appointed by the Attorney General, will:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—consolidate the authority and preserve the experience and manpower of the Bureau of Narcotics and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—work with states and local governments in their crackdown on illegal trade in drugs and narcotics, and help to train local agents and investigators.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—maintain worldwide operations, working closely with other nations, to suppress the trade in illicit narcotics and marihuana.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—conduct an extensive campaign of research and a nationwide public education program on drug abuse and its tragic effects.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan I forward today moves in the direction recommended by two distinguished groups:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—the 1949 Hoover Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—the 1963 Presidential Advisory Commission on Narcotic and Drug Abuse.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This Administration and this Congress have the will and the determination to stop the illicit traffic in drugs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But we need more than the will and the determination. We need a modern and efficient instrument of Government to transform our plans into action. That is what this Reorganization Plan calls for.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have also found that, by reason of these reorganizations, it is necessary to include in the accompanying plan provisions for the appointment and compensation of the five new positions as specified in section 3 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these new positions are those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable positions in the Executive Branch of the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Should the reorganization I propose take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of Federal law enforcement functions. It is not practicable at this time, however, to itemize the reduction in expenditures which may result.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I recommend that the Congress allow this urgently needed and important Reorganization Plan to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the past few years Congress and the President have pledged to make the Nation’s Capital a model of excellence for America: in government, in housing, in city planning, in law enforcement, in transportation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But the equality of any city is not just a matter of efficiency and public order. If it is to be truly great, the city must be lively and inviting—a place of beauty and pleasure.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The city’s life is lived not only in its buildings, but in its pools, playgrounds and recreation centers, in the places where the young gather to find excitement and delight, where the old come to find relaxation, fresh air, companionship.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In Washington, recreation is a vital element of the city’s school enrichment activities, its model city proj­ect and its summer programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But the D.C. Recreation Department is not an integral part of the District Government. With its six-member independent board, the autonomy of the Department prevents the D.C. Commissioner from providing policy supervision to the city’s recreation activities and from relating them to other community service programs—in health, education, child care, and conservation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There is no reason to distinguish between recreation and other community service programs now vested in the Commissioner.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly, I am today submitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1968. This plan brings recreation programs under the authority of the D.C. Commissioner. It enables the new City Government to make recreation an integral part of its strategy to bring more and better community services to the people who live in the city.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan achieves these objectives by abolishing the present Recreation Board and the Office of the Superintendent of Recreation. It transfers their functions to the D.C. Commissioner.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The accompanying reorganization plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Closer coordination of recreation with other municipal improvement programs of the District Government and the improved efficiency of recreation management will produce a higher return on the taxpayer’s investment in recreation programs, though the amount of savings cannot be estimated at this time.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I urge the Congress to permit this reorganization plan to take effect.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REDEVELOPMENT LAND AGENCY</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Section 1. Appointments</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(a) The functions of the President of the United States with respect to appointing certain members of the Board of Directors of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency (D.C. Code, sec. 5–703) are hereby transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) Nothing in this reorganization plan shall be deemed to terminate the tenure of any member of the Board of Directors of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency now in office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 2. Relationship of Board of Directors and Commissioner</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(a) There are transferred from the Board of Directors of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia the functions of adopting, prescribing, amending and repealing bylaws, rules, and regulations for the exercise of the powers of the Board under D.C. Code, secs. 5–701 to 5–719 or governing the manner in which its business may be conducted (D.C. Code, sec. 5–703(b)).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(b) Any part of the functions transferred by this section may be delegated by the Commissioner to the Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 3. References to District of Columbia Code</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">References in this reorganization plan to any provision of the District of Columbia Code are references to the provisions of statutory law codified under that provision and include the said provision as amended, modified, or supplemented prior to the effective date of this reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Urban Renewal is a vital weapon in the Nation’s attack on urban blight and physical decay. In the firm hands of a local executive determined to improve the face of his city, it is a powerful tool of reform.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the District of Columbia, urban renewal is managed by a Federal Agency, the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, headed by an independent five-man Board of Directors. Although the District Government pays the entire local share of the costs of urban renewal and although the Commissioner of the District of Columbia appoints three of the five members of the RLA Board, the Agency need not follow the Commissioner’s leadership or administrative direction.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To strengthen the D.C. Commissioner’s authority to initiate and guide the administration of urban renewal, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1968. This plan:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—gives the D.C. Commissioner the authority to appoint all five members of the RLA Board, by transferring to him the appointment function now vested in the President;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—transfers to him the authority to prescribe the rules and regulations governing the conduct of business by RLA. This function is now vested in the Board of Directors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Urban Renewal involves slum clearance, demolition, the relocation of families, the provision of new housing, the stimulation of rehabilitation and new employment. Throughout the Nation, it is clear that authority and leadership by the local chief executive is essential to weld together the full range of municipal functions and community service programs to change conditions in city slums.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In our Capital City the hopes for a balanced New Town and new housing development on the Fort Lincoln site in Northeast Washington, the rebuilding of the Shaw neighborhood, and a successful Model Cities program hinge on the leadership of the D.C. Commissioner. Members of the Congress have repeatedly stressed the need to establish the Commissioner’s effective control of all functions essential to local redevelopment. The attached plan takes a major step toward that objective.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan does not alter the corporate status of the Redevelopment Land Agency or any of the authorities now vested by law in the Agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The accompanying reorganization plan has been prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There are no direct savings deriving from this plan. However, it will improve the management of programs aimed at reviving the deteriorated social, economic, and physical structure of this city, our National Capital. The benefits and savings from a more successful attack on these problems cannot be estimated in advance, but their reality cannot be denied.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To achieve our goal of a model Capital, I therefore urge the Congress to permit this reorganization plan to take effect.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We live in a time when the technology of telecommunications is undergoing rapid change which will dramatically affect the whole of our society. It has long been recognized that the executive branch of the Federal government should be better equipped to deal with the issues which arise from telecommunications growth. As the largest single user of the nation’s telecommunications facilities, the Federal government must also manage its internal communications operations in the most effective manner possible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Accordingly, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">That plan would establish a new Office of Telecommunications Policy in the Executive Office of the President. The new unit would be headed by a Director and a Deputy Director who would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The existing office held by the Director of Telecommunications Management in the Office of Emergency Preparedness would be abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to the functions which are transferred to it by the reorganization plan, the new Office would perform certain other duties which I intend to assign to it by Executive order as soon as the reorganization plan takes effect. That order would delegate to the new Office essentially those functions which are now assigned to the Director of Telecommunications Management. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would be assisted in its research and analysis responsibilities by the agencies and departments of the Executive Branch including another new office, located in the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Office of Telecommunications Policy would play three essential roles:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">1. It would serve as the President’s principal adviser on telecommunications policy, helping to formulate government policies concerning a wide range of domestic and international telecommunications issues and helping to develop plans and programs which take full advantage of the nation’s technological capabilities. The speed of economic and technological advance in our time means that new questions concerning communications are constantly arising, questions on which the government must be well informed and well advised. The new Office will enable the President and all government officials to share more fully in the experience, the insights, and the forecasts of government and non-government experts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">2. The Office of Telecommunications Policy would help formulate policies and coordinate operations for the Federal government’s own vast communications systems. It would, for example, set guidelines for the various departments and agencies concerning their communications equipment and services. It would regularly review the ability of government communications systems to meet the security needs of the nation and to perform effectively in time of emergency. The Office would direct the assignment of those portions of the radio spectrum which are reserved for government use, carry out responsibilities conferred on the President by the Communications Satellite Act, advise State and local governments, and provide policy direction for the National Communications System.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">3. Finally, the new Office would enable the executive branch to speak with a clearer voice and to act as a more effective partner in discussions of communications policy with both the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission. This action would take away none of the prerogatives or functions assigned to the Federal Communications Commission by the Congress. It is my hope, however, that the new Office and the Federal Communications Commission would cooperate in achieving certain reforms in telecommunications policy, especially in their procedures for allocating portions of the radio spectrum for government and civilian use. Our current procedures must be more flexible if they are to deal adequately with problems such as the worsening spectrum shortage.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), “to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;” and section 901(a)(3), “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the government to the fullest extent practicable.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in sections 3(a) and 3(b) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan should result in the more efficient operation of the government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The public interest requires that government policies concerning telecommunications be formulated with as much sophistication and vision as possible. This reorganization plan—and the executive order which would follow it—are necessary instruments if the government is to respond adequately to the challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid pace of change in communications. I urge that the Congress allow this plan to become effective so that these necessary reforms can be accomplished.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Sec. 301. Effective Date</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The provisions of this reorganization plan shall take effect as provided by <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s906/a">section 906(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code, or on <date date="1970-07-01">July 1, 1970</date>, whichever is later.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We in government often are quick to call for reform in other institutions, but slow to reform ourselves. Yet nowhere today is modern management more needed than in government itself.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed and the Congress accepted a reorganization plan that laid the groundwork for providing managerial assistance for a modern Presidency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan placed the Bureau of the Budget within the Executive Office of the President. It made available to the President direct access to important new management instruments. The purpose of the plan was to improve the administration of the Government—to ensure that the Government could perform “promptly, effectively, without waste or lost motion.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Fulfilling that purpose today is far more difficult—and more important—than it was 30 years ago.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Last April, I created a President’s Advisory Council on Executive Organization and named to it a distinguished group of outstanding experts headed by Roy L. Ash. I gave the Council a broad charter to examine ways in which the Executive Branch could be better organized. I asked it to recommend specific organizational changes that would make the Executive Branch a more vigorous and more effective instrument for creating and carrying out the programs that are needed today. The Council quickly concluded that the place to begin was in the Executive Office of the President itself. I agree.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The past 30 years have seen enormous changes in the size, structure and functions of the Federal Government. The budget has grown from less than $10 billion to $200 billion. The number of civilian employees has risen from one million to more than two and a half million. Four new Cabinet departments have been created, along with more than a score of independent agencies. Domestic policy issues have become increasingly complex. The interrelationships among Government programs have become more intricate. Yet the organization of the President’s policy and management arms has not kept pace.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Over three decades, the Executive Office of the President has mushroomed but not by conscious design. In many areas it does not provide the kind of staff assistance and support the President needs in order to deal with the problems of government in the 1970s. We confront the 1970s with a staff organization geared in large measure to the tasks of the 1940s and 1950s.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One result, over the years, has been a tendency to enlarge the immediate White House staff—that is, the President’s personal staff, as distinct from the institutional structure—to assist with management functions for which the President is responsible. This has blurred the distinction between personal staff and management institutions; it has left key management functions to be performed only intermittently and some not at all. It has perpetuated outdated structures.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Another result has been, paradoxically, to inhibit the delegation of authority to Departments and agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A President whose programs are carefully coordinated, whose information system keeps him adequately informed, and whose organizational assignments are plainly set out, can delegate authority with security and confidence. A President whose office is deficient in these respects will be inclined, instead, to retain close control of operating responsibilities which he cannot and should not handle.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Improving the management processes of the President’s own office, therefore, is a key element in improving the management of the entire Executive Branch, and in strengthening the authority of its Departments and agencies. By providing the tools that are needed to reduce duplication, to monitor performance and to promote greater efficiency throughout the Executive Branch, this also will enable us to give the country not only more effective but also more economical government—which it deserves.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To provide the management tools and policy mechanisms needed for the 1970s, I am today transmitting to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970, prepared in accordance with Chapter 9 of Title 5 of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan draws not only on the work of the Ash Council itself, but also on the work of others that preceded—including the pioneering Brownlow Committee of 1936, the two Hoover Commissions, the Rockefeller Committee, and other Presidential task forces.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Essentially, the plan recognizes that two closely connected but basically separate functions both center in the President’s office: policy determination and executive management. This involves (1) what government should do, and (2) how it goes about doing it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">My proposed reorganization creates a new entity to deal with each of these functions:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—It establishes a Domestic Council, to coordinate policy formulation in the domestic area. This Cabinet group would be provided with an institutional staff, and to a considerable degree would be a domestic counterpart to the National Security Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—It establishes an Office of Management and Budget, which would be the President’s principal arm for the exercise of his managerial functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Domestic Council will be primarily concerned with <i>what</i> we do; the Office of Management and Budget will be primarily concerned with <i>how</i> we do it, and <i>how well</i> we do it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">DOMESTIC COUNCIL</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The past year’s experience with the Council for Urban Affairs has shown how immensely valuable a Cabinet-level council can be as a forum for both discussion and action on policy matters that cut across departmental jurisdictions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Domestic Council will be chaired by the President. Under the plan, its membership will include the Vice President, and the Secretaries of the Treasury, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health, Education and Welfare, Housing and Urban Development, and Transportation, and the Attorney General. I also intend to designate as members the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity and, while he remains a member of the Cabinet, the Postmaster General. (Although I continue to hope that the Congress will adopt my proposal to create, in place of the Post Office Department, a self-sufficient postal authority.) The President could add other Branch officials at his discretion.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Council will be supported by a staff under an Executive Director who will also be one of the President’s assistants. Like the National Security Council staff, this staff will work in close coordination with the President’s personal staff but will have its own institutional identity. By being established on a permanent, institutional basis, it will be designed to develop and employ the “institutional memory” so essential if continuity is to be maintained, and if experience is to play its proper role in the policy-making process.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There does not now exist an organized, institutionally-staffed group charged with advising the President on the total range of domestic policy. The Domestic Council will fill that need. Under the President’s direction, it will also be charged with integrating the various aspects of domestic policy into a consistent whole.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Among the specific policy functions in which I intend the Domestic Council to take the lead are these:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Assessing national needs, collecting information and developing forecasts, for the purpose of defining national goals and objectives.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Identifying alternative ways of achieving these objectives, and recommending consistent, integrated sets of policy choices.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Providing rapid response to Presidential needs for policy advice on pressing domestic issues.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Coordinating the establishment of national priorities for the allocation of available resources.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Maintaining a continuous review of the conduct of ongoing programs from a policy standpoint, and proposing reforms as needed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Much of the Council’s work will be accomplished by temporary, ad hoc project committees. These might take a variety of forms, such as task forces, planning groups or advisory bodies. They can be established with varying degrees of formality, and can be set up to deal either with broad program areas or with specific problems. The committees will draw for staff support on Department and agency experts, supplemented by the Council’s own staff and that of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Establishment of the Domestic Council draws on the experience gained during the past year with the Council for Urban Affairs, the Cabinet Committee on the Environment and the Council for Rural Affairs. The principal key to the operation of these Councils has been the effective functioning of their various subcommittees. The Councils themselves will be consolidated into the Domestic Council. Urban, Rural and Environment subcommittees of the Domestic Council will be strengthened, using access to the Domestic Council staff.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Overall, the Domestic Council will provide the President with a streamlined, consolidated domestic policy arm, adequately staffed, and highly flexible in its operation. It also will provide a structure through which departmental initiatives can be more fully considered, and expert advice from the Departments and agencies more fully utilized.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the reorganization plan, the technical and formal means by which the Office of Management and Budget is created is by re-designating the Bureau of the Budget as the Office of Management and Budget. The functions currently vested by law in the Bureau, or in its director, are transferred to the President, with the provision that he can then re-delegate them.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As soon as the reorganization plan takes effect, I intend to delegate those statutory functions to the Director of the new Office of Management and Budget, including those under section 212 of the Budget and Accounting Act, 1921.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">However, creation of the Office of Management and Budget represents far more than a mere change of name for the Bureau of the Budget. It represents a basic change in concept and emphasis, reflecting the broader management needs of the Office of the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Office will still perform the key function of assisting the President in the preparation of the annual Federal budget and overseeing its execution. It will draw upon the skills and experience of the extraordinarily able and dedicated career staff developed by the Bureau of the Budget. But preparation of the budget as such will no longer be its dominant, overriding concern.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While the budget function remains a vital tool of management, it will be strengthened by the greater emphasis the new office will place on fiscal analysis. The budget function is only one of several important management tools that the President must now have. He must also have a substantially enhanced institutional staff capability in other areas of executive management—particularly in program evaluation and coordination, improvement of Executive Branch organization, information and management systems, and development of executive talent. Under this plan, strengthened capability in these areas will be provided partly through internal reorganization, and it will also require additional staff resources.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Office of Management and Budget will place much greater emphasis on the evaluation of program performance: on assessing the extent to which programs are actually achieving their intended results, and delivering the intended services to the intended recipients. This is needed on a continuing basis, not as a one-time effort. Program evaluation will remain a function of the individual agencies as it is today. However, a single agency cannot fairly be expected to judge overall effectiveness in programs that cross agency lines—and the difference between agency and Presidential perspectives requires a capacity in the Executive Office to evaluate program performance whenever appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Office will expand efforts to improve inter-agency cooperation in the field. Washington-based coordinators will help work out interagency problems at the operating level, and assist in developing efficient coordinating mechanisms throughout the country. The success of these efforts depends on the experience, persuasion and understanding of an Office which will be an expediter and catalyst. The Office will also respond to requests from State and local governments for assistance on intergovernmental programs. It will work closely with the Vice President and the Office of Intergovernmental Relations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Improvement of Government organization, information and management systems will be a major function of the Office of Management and Budget. It will maintain a continuous review of the organizational structures and management processes of the Executive Branch, and recommend needed changes. It will take the lead in developing new information systems to provide the President with the performance and other data that he needs but does not now get. When new programs are launched, it will seek to ensure that they are not simply forced into or grafted onto existing organizational structures that may not be appropriate. Resistance to organizational change is one of the chief obstacles to effective government; the new Office will seek to ensure that organization keeps abreast of program needs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Office will also take the lead in devising programs for the development of career executive talent throughout the Government. Not the least of the President’s needs as Chief Executive is direct capability in the Executive Office for insuring that talented executives are used to the full extent of their abilities. Effective, coordinated efforts for executive manpower development have been hampered by the lack of a system for forecasting the needs for executive talent and appraising leadership potential. Both are crucial to the success of an enterprise—whether private or public.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Office of Management and Budget will be charged with advising the President on the development of new programs to recruit, train, motivate, deploy, and evaluate the men and women who make up the top ranks of the civil service, in the broadest sense of that term. It will not deal with individuals, but will rely on the talented professionals of the Civil Service Commission and the Departments and agencies themselves to administer these programs. Under the leadership of the Office of Management and Budget there will be joint efforts to see to it that all executive talent is well utilized wherever it may be needed throughout the Executive Branch, and to assure that executive training and motivation meet not only today’s needs but those of the years ahead.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Finally, the new Office will continue the Legislative Reference functions now performed by the Bureau of the Budget, drawing together agency reactions on all proposed legislation, and helping develop legislation to carry out the President’s program. It also will continue the Bureau’s work of improving and coordinating Federal statistical services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGES</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The people deserve a more responsive and more effective Government. The times require it. These changes will help provide it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each reorganization included in the plan which accompanies this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">Section 901(a) of Title 5</ref> of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to Section 901(a)(1), “to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the Executive Branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;” and Section 901(a)(3), “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations provided for in this plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers, as specified in Section 102(c) of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the Executive Branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While this plan will result in a modest increase in direct expenditures, its strengthening of the Executive Office of the President will bring significant indirect savings, and at the same time will help ensure that people actually receive the return they deserve for every dollar the Government spends. The savings will result from the improved efficiency these changes will provide throughout the Executive Branch—and also from curtailing the waste that results when programs simply fail to achieve their objectives. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate these indirect expenditure reductions which will result from the reorganization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I expect to follow with other reorganization plans, quite possibly including ones that will affect other activities of the Executive Office of the President. Our studies are continuing. But this by itself is a reorganization of major significance, and a key to the more effective functioning of the entire Executive Branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These changes would provide an improved system of policy making and coordination, a strengthened capacity to perform those functions that are now the central concerns of the Bureau of the Budget, and a more effective set of management tools for the performance of other functions that have been rapidly increasing in importance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization will not only improve the staff resources available to the President, but will also strengthen the advisory roles of those members of the Cabinet principally concerned with domestic affairs. By providing a means of formulation integrated and systematic recommendations on major domestic policy issues, the plan serves not only the needs of the President but also the interests of the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization plan is of major importance to the functioning of modern government. The national interest requires it. I urge that the Congress allow it to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code and providing for an Environmental Protection Agency. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in a more extended accompanying message.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), “to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;” and section 901(a)(3), “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in section 1 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><ref href="/us/usc/t5/s907">Section 907 of title 5</ref> of the United States Code will operate to preserve administrative proceedings, including any public hearing proceedings, related to the transferred functions, which are pending immediately prior to the taking effect of the reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan should result in more efficient operation of the Government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As concern with the condition of our physical environment has intensified, it has become increasingly clear that we need to know more about the total environment—land, water and air. It also has become increasingly clear that only by reorganizing our Federal efforts can we develop that knowledge, and effectively ensure the protection, development and enhancement of the total environment itself.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Government’s environmentally-related activities have grown up piecemeal over the years. The time has come to organize them rationally and systematically. As a major step in this direction, I am transmitting today two reorganization plans: one to establish an Environmental Protection Agency, and one to establish, within the Department of Commerce, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Our national government today is not structured to make a coordinated attack on the pollutants which debase the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that grows our food. Indeed, the present governmental structure for dealing with environmental pollution often defies effective and concerted action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Despite its complexity, for pollution control purposes the environment must be perceived as a single, interrelated system. Present assignments of departmental responsibilities do not reflect this interrelatedness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Many agency missions, for example, are designed primarily along media lines—air, water, and land. Yet the sources of air, water, and land pollution are interrelated and often interchangeable. A single source may pollute the air with smoke and chemicals, the land with solid wastes, and a river or lake with chemical and other wastes. Control of the air pollution may produce more solid wastes, which then pollute the land or water. Control of the water-polluting effluent may convert it into solid wastes, which must be disposed of on land.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Similarly, some pollutants—chemicals, radiation, pesticides—appear in all media. Successful control of them at present requires the coordinated efforts of a variety of separate agencies and departments. The results are not always successful.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A far more effective approach to pollution control would:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Identify pollutants.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Trace them through the entire ecological chain, observing and recording changes in form as they occur.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Determine the total exposure of man and his environment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Examine interactions among forms of pollution.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Identify where in the ecological chain interdiction would be most appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In organizational terms, this requires pulling together into one agency a variety of research, monitoring, standard-setting and enforcement activities now scattered through several departments and agencies. It also requires that the new agency include sufficient support elements—in research and in aids to State and local anti-pollution programs, for example—to give it the needed strength and potential for carrying out its mission. The new agency would also, of course, draw upon the results of research conducted by other agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">components of the epa</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the terms of Reorganization Plan No. 3, the following would be moved to the new Environmental Protection Agency:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The functions carried out by the Federal Water Quality Administration (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Functions with respect to pesticides studies now vested in the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The functions carried out by the National Air Pollution Control Administration (from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The functions carried out by the Bureau of Solid Waste Management and the Bureau of Water Hygiene, and portions of the functions carried out by the Bureau of Radiological Health of the Environmental Control Administration (from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Certain functions with respect to pesticides carried out by the Food and Drug Administration (from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Authority to perform studies relating to ecological system now vested in the Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Certain functions respecting radiation criteria and standards now vested in the Atomic Energy Commission and the Federal Radiation Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Functions respecting pesticides registration and related activities now carried out by the Agricultural Research Service (from the Department of Agriculture).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With its broad mandate, EPA would also develop competence in areas of environmental protection that have not previously been given enough attention, such, for example, as the problem of noise, and it would provide an organization to which new programs in these areas could be added.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In brief, these are the principal functions to be transferred:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Federal Water Quality Administration.—Charged with the control of pollutants which impair water quality, it is broadly concerned with the impact of degraded water quality. It performs a wide variety of functions, including research, standard-setting and enforcement, and provides construction grants and technical assistance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Certain pesticides research authority from the Department of the Interior.—Authority for research on the effects of pesticides on fish and wildlife would be provided to the EPA through transfer of the specialized research authority of the pesticides act enacted in 1958. Interior would retain its responsibility to do research on all factors affecting fish and wildlife. Under this provision, only one laboratory would be transferred to the EPA—the Gulf Breeze Biological Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. The EPA would work closely with the fish and wildlife laboratories remaining with the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">National Air Pollution Control Administration.—As the principal Federal agency concerned with air pollution, it conducts research on the effects of air pollution, operates a monitoring network, and promulgates criteria which serve as the basis for setting air quality standards. Its regulatory functions are similar to those of the Federal Water Quality Administration. NAPCA is responsible for administering the Clean Air Act, which involves designating air quality regions, approving State standards, and providing financial and technical assistance to State Control agencies to enable them to comply with the Act’s provisions. It also sets and enforces Federal automotive emission standards.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Elements of the Environmental Control Administration.—ECA is the focal point within HEW for evaluation and control of a broad range of environmental health problems, including water quality, solid wastes, and radiation. Programs in the ECA involve research, development of criteria and standards, and the administration of planning and demonstration grants. From the ECA, the activities of the Bureaus of Water Hygiene and Solid Waste Management and portions of the activities of the Bureau of Radiological Health would be transferred. Other functions of the ECA including those related to the regulation of radiation from consumer products and occupational safety and health would remain in HEW.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pesticides research and standard-setting programs of the Food and Drug Administration.—FDA’s pesticides program consists of setting and enforcing standards which limit pesticide residues in food. EPA would have the authority to set pesticide standards and to monitor compliance with them, as well as to conduct related research. However, as an integral part of its food protection activities, FDA, would retain its authority to remove from the market food with excess pesticide residues.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">General ecological research from the Council on Environmental Quality.—This authority to perform studies and research relating to ecological systems would be in addition to EPA’s other specific research authorities, and it would help EPA to measure the impact of pollutants. The Council on Environmental Quality would retain its authority to conduct studies and research relating to environmental quality.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Environmental radiation standards programs.—The Atomic Energy Commission is now responsible for establishing environmental radiation standards and emission limits for radioactivity. Those standards have been based largely on broad guidelines recommended by the Federal Radiation Council. The Atomic Energy Commission’s authority to set standards for the protection of the general environment from radioactive material would be transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency. The functions of the Federal Radiation Council would also be transferred. AEC would retain responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of radiation standards through its licensing authority.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Pesticides registration program of the Agricultural Research Service.—The Department of Agriculture is currently responsible for several distinct functions related to pesticides use. It conducts research on the efficacy of various pesticides as related to other pest control methods and on the effects of pesticides on non-target plants, livestock, and poultry. It registers pesticides, monitors their persistence and carries out an educational program on pesticide use through the extension service. It conducts extensive pest control programs which utilize pesticides.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By transferring the Department of Agriculture’s pesticides registration and monitoring function to the EPA and merging it with the pesticides programs being transferred from HEW and Interior, the new agency would be given a broad capability for control over the introduction of pesticides into the environment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of Agriculture would continue to conduct research on the effectiveness of pesticides. The Department would furnish this information to the EPA, which would have the responsibility for actually licensing pesticides for use after considering environmental and health effects. Thus the new agency would be able to make use of the expertise of the Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">advantages of reorganization</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization would permit response to environmental problems in a manner beyond the previous capability of our pollution control programs. The EPA would have the capacity to do research on important pollutants irrespective of the media in which they appear, and on the impact of these pollutants on the total environment. Both by itself and together with other agencies, the EPA would monitor the condition of the environment—biological as well as physical. With these data, the EPA would be able to establish quantitative “environmental baselines”—critical if we are to measure adequately the success or failure of our pollution abatement efforts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As no disjointed array of separate programs can, the EPA would be able—in concert with the States—to set and enforce standards for air and water quality and for individual pollutants. This consolidation of pollution control authorities would help assure that we do not create new environmental problems in the process of controlling existing ones. Industries seeking to minimize the adverse impact of their activities on the environment would be assured of consistent standards covering the full range of their waste disposal problems. As the States develop and expand their own pollution control programs, they would be able to look to one agency to support their efforts with financial and technical assistance and training.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In proposing that the Environmental Protection Agency be set up as a separate new agency, I am making an exception to one of my own principles: that, as a matter of effective and orderly administration, additional new independent agencies normally should not be created. In this case, however, the arguments against placing environmental protection activities under the jurisdiction of one or another of the existing departments and agencies are compelling.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the first place, almost every part of government is concerned with the environment in some way, and affects it in some way. Yet each department also has its own primary mission—such as resource development, transportation, health, defense, urban growth or agriculture—which necessarily affects its own view of environmental questions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the second place, if the critical standard-setting functions were centralized within any one existing department, it would require that department constantly to make decisions affecting other departments—in which, whether fairly or unfairly, its own objectivity as an impartial arbiter could be called into question.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Because environmental protection cuts across so many jurisdictions, and because arresting environmental deterioration is of great importance to the quality of life in our country and the world, I believe that in this case a strong, independent agency is needed. That agency would, of course, work closely with and draw upon the expertise and assistance of other agencies having experience in the environmental area.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">roles and functions of epa</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The principal roles and functions of the EPA would include:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The establishment and enforcement of environmental protection standards consistent with national environmental goals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The conduct of research on the adverse effects of pollution and on methods and equipment for controlling it, the gathering of information on pollution, and the use of this information in strengthening environmental protection programs and recommending policy changes.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Assisting others, through grants, technical assistance and other means in arresting pollution of the environment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Assisting the Council on Environmental Quality in developing and recommending to the President new policies for the protection of the environment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One natural question concerns the relationship between the EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality, recently established by Act of Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is my intention and expectation that the two will work in close harmony, reinforcing each other’s mission. Essentially, the Council is a top-level advisory group which might be compared with the Council of Economic Advisers), while the EPA would be an operating, “line” organization. The Council will continue to be a part of the Executive Office of the President and will perform its overall coordinating and advisory roles with respect to all Federal programs related to environmental quality.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Council, then, is concerned with all aspects of environmental quality—wildlife preservation, parklands, land use, and population growth, as well as pollution. The EPA would be charged with protecting the environment by abating pollution. In short, the Council focuses on what our broad policies in the environmental field should be; the EPA would focus on setting and enforcing pollution control standards. The two are not competing, but complementary—and taken together, they should give us, for the first time, the means to mount an effectively coordinated campaign against environmental degradation in all of its many forms.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The oceans and the atmosphere are interacting parts of the total environmental system upon which we depend not only for the quality of our lives, but for life itself.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We face immediate and compelling needs for better protection of life and property from natural hazards, and for a better understanding of the total environment—an understanding which will enable us more effectively to monitor and predict its actions, and ultimately, perhaps to exercise some degree of control over them.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We also face a compelling need for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources. The global oceans, which constitute nearly three-fourths of the surface of our planet, are today the least-understood, the least-developed, and the least-protected part of our earth. Food from the oceans will increasingly be a key element in the world’s fight against hunger. The mineral resources of the ocean beds and of the oceans themselves, are being increasingly tapped to meet the growing world demand. We must understand the nature of these resources, and assure their development without either contaminating the marine environment or upsetting its balance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Establishment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration—NOAA—within the Department of Commerce would enable us to approach these tasks in a coordinated way. By employing a unified approach to the problems of the oceans and atmosphere, we can increase our knowledge and expand our opportunities not only in those areas, but in the third major component of our environment, the solid earth, as well.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Scattered through various Federal departments and agencies, we already have the scientific, technological, and administrative resources to make an effective, unified approach possible. What we need is to bring them together. Establishment of NOAA would do so.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By far the largest of the components being merged would be the Commerce Department’s Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), with some 10,000 employees (70 percent of NOAA’s total personnel strength) and estimated Fiscal 1970 expenditures of almost $200 million. Placing NOAA within the Department of Commerce therefore entails the least dislocation, while also placing it within a department which has traditionally been a center for service activities in the scientific and technological area.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">components of noaa</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under terms of Reorganization Plan No. 4, the programs of the following organizations would be moved into NOAA:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The Environmental Science Services Administration (from within the Department of Commerce).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Elements of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The marine sport fish program of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The Marine Minerals Technology Center of the Bureau of Mines (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The Office of Sea Grant Programs (from the National Science Foundation).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Elements of the U.S. Lake Survey (from the Department of the Army).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition, by executive action, the programs of the following organizations would be transferred to NOAA:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The National Oceanographic Data Center (from the Department of the Navy).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center (from the Department of the Navy).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The National Data Buoy Project (from the Department of Transportation).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In brief, these are the principal functions of the programs and agencies to be combined:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">(ESSA) comprises the following components:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The Weather Bureau (weather, marine, river and flood forecasting and warning).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The Coast and Geodetic Survey (earth and marine description, mapping and charting).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The Environmental Data Service (storage and retrieval of environmental data).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The National Environmental Satellite Center (observation of the global environment from earth-orbiting satellites).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The ESSA Research Laboratories (research on physical environmental problems).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">ESSA’s activities include observing and predicting the state of the oceans, the state of the lower and upper atmosphere, and the size and shape of the earth. It maintains the nation’s warning systems for such natural hazards as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and seismic sea waves. It provides information for national defense, agriculture, transportation and industry.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">ESSA monitors atmospheric, oceanic and geophysical phenomena on a global basis, through an unparalleled complex of air, ocean, earth and space facilities. It also prepares aeronautical and marine maps and charts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and marine sport fish activities.—Those fishery activities of the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which are ocean related and those which are directed toward commercial fishing would be transferred. The Fish and Wildlife Service’s Bureau of Commercial Fisheries has the dual function of strengthening the fishing industry and promoting conservation of fishery stocks. It conducts research on important marine species and on fundamental oceanography, and operates a fleet of oceanographic vessels and a number of laboratories. Most of its activities would be transferred. From the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the marine sport fishing program would be transferred. This involves five supporting laboratories and three ships engaged in activities to enhance marine sport fishing opportunities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Marine Minerals Technology Center is concerned with the development of marine mining technology.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Office of Sea Grant Programs.—The Sea Grant Program was authorized in 1966 to permit the Federal Government to assist the academic and industrial communities in developing marine resources and technology. It aims at strengthening education and training of marine specialists, supporting applied research in the recovery and use of marine resources, and developing extension and advisory services. The Office carries out these objectives by making grants to selected academic institutions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The U.S. Lake Survey has two primary missions. It prepares and publishes navigation charts of the Great Lakes and tributary waters and conducts research on a variety of hydraulic and hydrologic phenomena of the Great Lakes’ waters. Its activities are very similar to those conducted along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts by ESSA’s Coast and Geodetic Survey.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Oceanographic Data Center is responsible for the collection and dissemination of oceanographic data accumulated by all Federal agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center provides a central Federal service for the calibration and testing of oceanographic instruments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Data Buoy Development Project was established to determine the feasibility of deploying a system of automatic ocean buoys to obtain oceanic and atmospheric data.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">role of noaa</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Drawing these activities together into a single agency would make possible a balanced Federal program to improve our understanding of the resources of the sea, and permit their development and use while guarding against the sort of thoughtless exploitation that in the past laid waste to so many of our precious natural assets. It would make possible a consolidated program for achieving a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena, which so greatly affect our lives and activities. It would facilitate the cooperation between public and private interests that can best serve the interests of all.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I expect that NOAA would exercise leadership in developing a national oceanic and atmospheric program of research and development. It would coordinate its own scientific and technical resources with the technical and operational capabilities of other government agencies and private institutions. As important, NOAA would continue to provide those services to other agencies of government, industry and private individuals which have become essential to the efficient operation of our transportation systems, our agriculture and our national security. I expect it to maintain continuing and close liaison with the new Environmental Protection Agency and the Council on Environmental Quality as part of an effort to ensure that environmental questions are dealt with in their totality and that they benefit from the full range of the government’s technical and human resources.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Authorities who have studied this matter, including the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources, strongly recommended the creation of a National Advisory Committee for the Oceans. I agree. Consequently, I will request, upon approval of the plan, that the Secretary of Commerce establish a National Advisory Committee for the Oceans and the Atmosphere to advise him on the progress of governmental and private programs in achieving the nation’s oceanic and atmospheric objectives.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">AN ON-GOING PROCESS</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations which I am here proposing afford both the Congress and the Executive Branch an opportunity to re-evaluate the adequacy of existing program authorities involved in these consolidations. As these two new organizations come into being, we may well find that supplementary legislation to perfect their authorities will be necessary. I look forward to working with the Congress in this task.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In formulating these reorganization plans, I have been greatly aided by the work of the President’s Advisory Council on Executive Organization (the Ash Council), the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources (the Stratton Commission, appointed by President Johnson), my special task force on oceanography headed by Dr. James Wakelin, and by the information developed during both House and Senate hearings on proposed NOAA legislation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Many of those who have advised me have proposed additional reorganizations, and it may well be that in the future I shall recommend further changes. For the present, however, I think the two reorganizations transmitted today represent a sound and significant beginning. I also think that in practical terms, in this sensitive and rapidly developing area, it is better to proceed a step at a time—and thus to be sure that we are not caught up in a form of organizational indigestion from trying to rearrange too much at once. As we see how these changes work out, we will gain a better understanding of what further changes—in addition to these—might be desirable.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Ultimately, our objective should be to insure that the nation’s environmental and resource protection activities are so organized as to maximize both the effective coordination of all and the effective functioning of each.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Congress, the Administration and the public all share a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment, and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man. With its acceptance of these reorganization plans, the Congress will help us fulfill that commitment.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. The plan would transfer to the Secretary of Commerce various functions relating to the oceans and atmosphere, including commercial fishery functions, and would establish a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Department of Commerce. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in a more extended accompanying message.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), “to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;” and section 901(a)(3) “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in section 2 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan should result in the more efficient operation of the Government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">America is a nation unique in the political history of the world. More than any other nation, it is the sum of the energies and efforts of all of its people. The American tradition of voluntary involvement—of freely committing one’s time and talents in the search for civic improvement and social progress—gives an extra dimension to the meaning of democracy. In the past decade the Federal Government has built on this tradition by developing channels for joining the spirit of voluntary citizen service in America with public needs, both domestically and abroad. Many of these efforts have had marked success. But the circumstances in which these efforts were conceived have changed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">National and international needs have altered. The opportunities for voluntary service must be adapted and improved to meet these new needs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Recognizing that private channels of voluntary action are a vital source of strength in our national life, I have supported the establishment and development of the National Center for Voluntary Action. The National Center is a private, non-profit partner in the effort to generate and encourage volunteer service. The Center works to promote the establishment of local Voluntary Action Centers, as well as to assist in the expansion of voluntary action organizations already in existence. It stimulates voluntary action by providing information on successful voluntary efforts, and it assists in directing those who wish to volunteer services to areas and endeavors in which their services are needed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Center for Voluntary Action is functioning now to fill a vital need in the private voluntary sector. Now we must turn our attention to bringing government volunteer programs into line with new national priorities and new opportunities for meeting those priorities. We must take full advantage of the lessons of the past decade, and we must build on the experience of that period if we are to realize the full potential of voluntary citizen service. This is no longer a matter of choice. We cannot afford to misuse or ignore the considerable talents and energies of our people. In the coming years, the continued progress of our society is going to depend increasingly upon the willingness of more Americans to participate in voluntary service and upon our ability to channel their service effectively.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">One matter of consequence to the problems of properly channeling volunteer services and expanding government’s role in the development of volunteer resources is the proliferation of government volunteer programs. It was perhaps inevitable that these programs would be generated almost at random across the spectrum of government concern for human needs. This occurred in a period when the Federal Government was still attempting to define its relationship with, and its purposes in, the area of voluntary service. Now the role of government has been confirmed and its responsibilities and obligations are clear. Meeting these responsibilities and obligations will be a long, difficult, and challenging adventure. But it is an adventure we can look to with excitement and with the knowledge that the only sure source of failure can be a failure of the will of the American people. I do not believe it will fail.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The foundation for a greatly expanded government contribution to volunteer service already exists. Now we must consolidate that foundation in order to build on it. To accomplish this, I propose a reorganization of the present volunteer service system. Accordingly, I herewith transmit to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1971, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. Reorganization would bring together within a single agency a number of voluntary action programs presently scattered throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government. The new agency would be called Action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">COMPOSITION</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the reorganization plan Action would administer the functions of the following programs:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Volunteers in Service to America: VISTA volunteers work in domestic poverty areas to help the poor break the poverty cycle.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Auxiliary and Special Volunteer Programs in the Office of Economic Opportunity: At present the National Student Volunteer Program is administered under this authority. This program stimulates student voluntary action programs which deal with the problems of the poor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Foster Grandparents: This program provides opportunities for the elderly poor to assist needy children.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Retired Senior Volunteer Program: RSVP provides opportunities for retired persons to perform voluntary services in their communities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Service Corps of Retired Executives: SCORE provides opportunities for retired businessmen to assist in the development of small businesses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Active Corps of Executives: ACE provides opportunities for working businessmen to assist in the development of small businesses.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), “to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;” and section 901(a)(3), “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in section 1 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization plan should result in more efficient operation of the Government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which would result from this action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Upon the establishment of Action, I would delegate to it the principal authority for the Peace Corps now vested in me as President and delegated to the Secretary of State. In addition, the function of the Office of Voluntary Action, now operating in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, would be transferred to the new agency by executive action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Finally, I will submit legislation which would include the transfer of the functions of the Teacher Corps from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to the new agency. This legislation would expand authority to develop new uses of volunteer talents, it would provide a citizens’ advisory board to work with the director of the new agency, and it would provide authority to match private contributions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">GOALS</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Although reorganization is only a step, it is the essential first step toward the goal of a system of volunteer service which uses to the fullest advantages the power of all the American people to serve the purposes of the American nation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In pursuing this goal the new agency would, first, expand the testing and development of innovations in voluntary actions. Health services, housing the environment, educational development, manpower and community planning are just a few of the areas in which we would act to accomplish more through voluntary service, and I intend to ask for additional funds and additional authority for Action to explore new approaches to these and other problems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the future, we are going to have to find new ways for more people to fulfill themselves and to lead satisfying and productive lives. The problems are of concern even now, but they must be put in perspective quickly because they will soon be upon us. I believe at least some of the answers will be found in volunteer service. Action would work to find those answers and apply them.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, there are many Americans who want to contribute to our national life through voluntary citizen service, but who cannot serve full time. Their contributions must not be wasted. Volunteers in full-time service would work with part-time volunteers and the new agency would develop and provide opportunities for more people to give part-time service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Third, Action would bring together in one place programs which appeal predominantly to younger Americans with those that appeal to older Americans, and would work to bring the energy, the innovative spirit, the experience, and the skills of each to bear on specific problems. The generations in America share America’s problems—they must share in the search for solutions so that we all may share in the benefits of our solutions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Fourth, Action would develop programs for combining foreign service with domestic service to accommodate volunteers interested in such an opportunity. I believe that young people in particular would be interested in the chance for this experience and would greatly benefit from it. I know there would be great value, for example, in permitting those who have served the needs of the poor abroad to turn their skills and experience to helping the poor at home, and vice versa. In addition, if volunteers are to reap the full benefit of serving, and if they are to be able to provide others the full benefit of their service, then we must open the doors to a fuller exchange of ideas and experiences between overseas and domestic volunteer efforts. These exchanges would considerably enhance the value of the experience gained in these endeavors by broadening the areas in which that experience is applied.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Fifth, at the present time valuable professional skills offered in voluntary service are too frequently limited by narrow categorical programs when their broader application is urgently needed. For example, the contributions of businessmen made through SCORE and ACE are provided only through the Small Business Administration. We know that the skills of business can be used in many areas where they are not used presently. Action would open new channels for service and would permit a more extensive utilization of business and other vocational and professional abilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Finally, by centralizing administrative functions of the volunteer services, the new agency would provide a more effective system of recruitment, training, and placement of full-time volunteers than the present circumstances permit. It would provide a single source of information and assistance for those who seek to volunteer full-time service. And it would permit more effective management of services than is currently possible in the administration of volunteer programs, as well as the more efficient use of resources.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">PRINCIPLES</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In restructuring our system of volunteer services, we can accomplish the goals which I have set forth. But we must do more than this. We must restructure our thinking about volunteer services. We must determine how to use our volunteer resources to accomplish more than they accomplish now. We need an increased effort to stimulate broader volunteer service, to involve more volunteers, and to involve them not simply as foot-soldiers in massive enterprises directed from the top, but in those often small and local efforts that show immediate results, that give immediate satisfaction—those efforts that return to citizens a sense of having a hand in the business of building America. Part of our rethinking of this matter must look to the past so that we may properly meet the needs of the present and prepare for the possibilities of the future.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Volunteer service in poverty areas is a case in point. We already have considerable experience in dealing with the problems of poverty through the use of volunteers. Now we must build upon this experience and find new ways to use more effectively the volunteers presently serving in poverty areas, as well as in all other areas, and to stimulate new programs so that additional numbers of volunteers can assist in the solution of community and national problems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In line with this effort to build on what we have learned. Action would function with particular concern for these basic principles:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—It would encourage local initiative, and would support local programs to solve local problems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Where appropriate, the new agency would assign volunteers to assist, and work under the technical supervision of other Federal agencies, State and local agencies or organizations, and private sponsors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The services of local part-time volunteers would be sought and supported in the effort to accomplish specific jobs. They would be assisted, when necessary, by full-time volunteers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Universities and colleges, State, city and private organizations must be engaged in the effort to broaden opportunities for volunteer service and under the new agency they would be assisted in these efforts.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Finally, to meet the increasing need for skilled volunteers, Action would give increased emphasis to recruiting and applying the skills of trained craftsmen and professional workers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">FUNDING</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To insure that the new agency has financial resources to begin working toward the goals I have outlined, I will seek for this agency an additional $20 million above the budget requests I have already submitted for the component agencies. These funds would be directed primarily to finding new ways to use volunteer services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">CONCLUSION</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The early nineteenth century observer of America, Alexis de Tocqueville, was intrigued by the propensity of Americans to join together in promoting common purposes. “As soon as several of the inhabitants of the United States have taken up an opinion or a feeling which they wish to promote in the world, they look out for mutual assistance, and as soon as they have found one another out, they combine. From that moment they are no longer isolated men, but a power seen from afar * * *.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Though we have seen the success of Government volunteer efforts in the past ten years, I believe voluntary citizen service is still little more than a power seen from afar. In relation to its potential, this power is virtually undeveloped. We must develop it.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There are those today, as there always will be, who find infinite fault with life in this Nation and who conveniently forget that they share responsibility for the quality of life we lead. But our needs are too great for this attitude to be accepted. America belongs to all of its people. We are all responsible for the direction this Nation will take in the century ahead, for the quality of life we will lead and our children will lead. We are all responsible, whether we choose to be or not, for the survival and the success of the American experience and the American dream.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">So there is little room for the luxury of making complaints without making commitments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">America must enlist the ideals, the energy, the experience, and the skills of its people on a larger scale than it ever has in the past. We must insure that these efforts be used to maximum advantage. We must insure that the desire to serve be linked with the opportunity to serve. We must match the vision of youth with the wisdom of experience. We must apply the understanding gained from foreign service to domestic needs, and we must extend what we learn in domestic service to other nations. And in all these endeavors, I believe, we can bring the power seen from afar to focus clearly on the problems and the promise of our time.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On January 5 I announced a three-part program to streamline the executive branch of the Federal Government. By concentrating less responsibility in the President’s immediate staff and more in the hands of the departments and agencies, this program should significantly improve the services of the Government. I believe these reforms have become so urgently necessary that I intend, with the cooperation of the Congress, to pursue them with all of the resources of my office during the coming year.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The first part of this program is a renewed drive to achieve passage of my legislative proposals to overhaul the Cabinet departments. Secondly, I have appointed three Cabinet Secretaries as Counsellors to the President with coordinating responsibilities in the broad areas of human resources, natural resources, and community development, and five Assistants to the President with special responsibilities in the areas of domestic affairs, economic affairs, foreign affairs, executive management, and operations of the White House.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The third part of this program is a sharp reduction in the overall size of the Executive Office of the President and a reorientation of that office back to its original mission as a staff for top-level policy formation and monitoring of policy execution in broad functional areas. The Executive Office of the President should no longer be encumbered with the task of managing or administering programs which can be run more effectively by the departments and agencies. I have therefore concluded that a number of specialized operational and program functions should be shifted out of the Executive Office into the line departments and agencies of the Government. Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1973, transmitted herewith, would effect such changes with respect to emergency preparedness functions and scientific and technological affairs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">STREAMLINING THE FEDERAL SCIENCE ESTABLISHMENT</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the National Science Foundation was established by an act of the Congress in 1950, its statutory responsibilities included evaluation of the Government’s scientific research programs and development of basic science policy. In the late 1950’s however, with the effectiveness of the U.S. science effort under serious scrutiny as a result of sputnik, the post of Science Advisor to the President was established. The White House became increasingly involved in the evaluation and coordination of research and development programs and in science policy matters, and that involvement was institutionalized in 1962 when a reorganization plan established the Office of Science and Technology within the Executive Office of the President, through transfer of authorities formerly vested in the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With advice and assistance from OST during the past decade, the scientific and technological capability of the Government has been markedly strengthened. This administration is firmly committed to sustained, broad-based national effort in science and technology, as I made plain last year in the first special message on the subject ever sent by a President to the Congress. The research and development capability of the various executive departments and agencies, civilian as well as defense, has been upgraded. The National Science Foundation has broadened from its earlier concentration on basic research support to take on a significant role in applied research as well. It has matured in its ability to play a coordinating and evaluative role within the Government and between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have therefore concluded that it is timely and appropriate to transfer to the Director of the National Science Foundation all functions presently vested in the Office of Science and Technology, and to abolish that office. Reorganization Plan No. 1 would effect these changes.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The multi-disciplinary staff resources of the Foundation will provide analytic capabilities for performance of the transferred functions. In addition, the Director of the Foundation will be able to draw on expertise from all of the Federal agencies, as well as from outside the Government, for assistance in carrying out his new responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is also my intention, after the transfer of responsibilities is effected, to ask Dr. H. Guyford Stever, the current Director of the Foundation, to take on the additional post of Science Adviser. In this capacity, he would advise and assist the White House, Office of Management and Budget, Domestic Council, and other entities within the Executive Office of the President on matters where scientific and technological expertise is called for, and would act as the President’s representative in selected cooperative programs in international scientific affairs, including chairing such joint bodies as the U.S.–U.S.S.R. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In the case of national security, the Department of Defense has strong capabilities for assessing weapons needs and for undertaking new weapons development, and the President will continue to draw primarily on this source for advice regarding military technology. The President in special situations also may seek independent studies or assessments concerning military technology from within or outside the Federal establishment, using the machinery of the National Security Council for this purpose, as well as the Science Adviser when appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In one special area of technology—space and aeronautics—a coordinating council has existed within the Executive Office of the President since 1958. This body, the National Aeronautics and Space Council, met a major need during the evolution of our nation’s space program. Vice President Agnew has served with distinction as its chairman for the past four years. At my request, beginning in 1969, the Vice President also chaired a special Space Task Group charged with developing strategy alternatives for a balanced U.S. space program in the coming years.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As a result of this work, basic policy issues in the United States space effort have been resolved, and the necessary interagency relationships have been established. I have therefore concluded, with the Vice President’s concurrence, that the Council can be discontinued. Needed policy coordination can now be achieved through the resources of the executive departments and agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, augmented by some of the former Council staff. Accordingly, my reorganization plan proposes the abolition of the National Aeronautics and Space Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">A NEW APPROACH TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The organization within the Executive Office of the President which has been known in recent years as the Office of Emergency Preparedness dates back, through its numerous predecessor agencies, more than 20 years. It has performed valuable functions in developing plans for emergency preparedness, in administering Federal disaster relief, and in overseeing and assisting the agencies in this area.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">OEP’s work as a coordinating and supervisory authority in this field has in fact been so effective—particularly under the leadership of General George A. Lincoln, its director for the past four years, who retired earlier this month after an exceptional military and public service career—that the line departments and agencies which in the past have shared in the performance of the various preparedness functions now possess the capability to assume full responsibility for those functions. In the interest of efficiency and economy, we can now further streamline the Executive Office of the President by formally relocating those responsibilities and closing the Office of Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to accomplish this reform in two steps. First, Reorganization Plan No. 1 would transfer to the President all functions previously vested by law in the Office or its Director, except the Director’s role as a member of the National Security Council, which would be abolished; and it would abolish the Office of Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions to be transferred to the President from OEP are largely incidental to emergency authorities already vested in him. They include functions under the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 [former <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s4401">42 U.S.C. 4401</ref> et seq.]; the function of determining whether a major disaster has occurred within the meaning of (1) <ref href="/us/act/1950-09-30/s7">Section 7 of the Act of September 30, 1950</ref>, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t20/s241–1">20 U.S.C. 241–1</ref>, or (2) Section 762(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as added by Section 161(a) of the Education Amendments of 1972, <ref href="/us/pl/92/318">Public Law 92–318</ref>, <ref href="/us/stat/86/288">86 Stat. 288</ref> at 299 (relating to the furnishing by the Commissioner of Education of disaster relief assistance for educational purposes) [former <ref href="/us/usc/t20/s1132d–1">20 U.S.C. 1132d–1</ref>]; and functions under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s1862">19 U.S.C. 1862</ref>), with respect to the conduct of investigations to determine the effects on national security of the importation of certain articles.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Civil Defense Advisory Council within OEP would also be abolished by this plan, as changes in domestic and international conditions since its establishment in 1950 have now obviated the need for a standing council of this type. Should advice of the kind the Council has provided be required again in the future, State and local officials and experts in the field can be consulted on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Second, as soon as the plan became effective, I would delegate OEP’s former functions as follows:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">All OEP responsibilities having to do with preparedness for and relief of civil emergencies and disasters would be transferred to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This would provide greater field capabilities for coordination of Federal disaster assistance with that provided by States and local communities, and would be in keeping with the objective of creating a broad, new Department of Community Development.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">OEP’s responsibilities for measures to ensure the continuity of civil government operations in the event of major military attack would be reassigned to the General Services Administration, as would responsibility for resource mobilization including the management of national security stockpiles, with policy guidance in both cases to be provided by the National Security Council, and with economic considerations relating to changes in stockpile levels to be coordinated by the Council on Economic Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Investigations of imports which might threaten the national security—assigned to OEP by Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 [<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s1862">19 U.S.C. 1862</ref>]—would be reassigned to the Treasury Department, whose other trade studies give it a readymade capability in this field; the National Security Council would maintain its supervisory role over strategic imports.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Those disaster relief authorities which have been reserved to the President in the past, such as the authority to declare major disasters, will continue to be exercised by him under these new arrangements. In emergency situations calling for rapid interagency coordination, the Federal response will be coordinated by the Executive Office of the President under the general supervision of the Assistant to the President in charge of executive management.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Oil Policy Committee will continue to function as in the past, unaffected by this reorganization, except that I will designate the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury as chairman in place of the Director of OEP. The committee will operate under the general supervision of the Assistant to the President in charge of economic affairs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">DECLARATIONS</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found that each action included in the accompanying plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">Section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1), “to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;” and in Section 901(a)(3), “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;” and in Section 901(a)(5), “to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which will result from the actions proposed, personnel and budget savings from abolition of the National Aeronautics and Space Council and the Office of Science and Technology alone will exceed $2 million annually, and additional savings should result from a reduction of Executive Pay Schedule positions now associated with other transferred and delegated functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan has as its one logically consistent subject matter the streamlining of the Executive Office of the President and the disposition of major responsibilities currently conducted in the Executive Office of the President, which can better be performed elsewhere or abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions which would be abolished by this plan, and the statutory authorities for each, are:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(1) the functions of the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness with respect to being a member of the National Security Council (Sec. 101, National Security Act of 1947, as amended, <ref href="/us/usc/t50/s402">50 U.S.C. 402</ref>; and Sec. 4, Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958);</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(2) the functions of the Civil Defense Advisory Council (Sec. 102(a) Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950; 50 U.S.C. App. 2272(a)); and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">(3) the functions of the National Aeronautics and Space Council (Sec. 201, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958; <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s2471">42 U.S.C. 2471</ref>).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proposed reorganization is a necessary part of the restructuring of the Executive Office of the President. It would provide through the Director of the National Science Foundation a strong focus for Federal efforts to encourage the development and application of science and technology to meet national needs. It would mean better preparedness for and swifter response to civil emergencies, and more reliable precautions against threats to the national security. The leaner and less diffuse Presidential staff structure which would result would enhance the President’s ability to do his job and would advance the interests of the Congress as well.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Drug abuse is one of the most vicious and corrosive forces attacking the foundations of American society today. It is a major cause of crime and a merciless destroyer of human lives. We must fight it with all of the resources at our command.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This Administration has declared all-out, global war on the drug menace. As I reported to the Congress earlier this month in my State of the Union message, there is evidence of significant progress on a number of fronts in that war.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Both the rate of new addiction to heroin and the number of narcotic-related deaths showed an encouraging downturn last year. More drug addicts and abusers are in treatment and rehabilitation programs than ever before.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Progress in pinching off the supply of illicit drugs was evident in last year’s stepped-up volume of drug seizures worldwide—which more than doubled in 1972 over the 1971 level.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Arrests of traffickers have risen by more than one-third since 1971. Prompt Congressional action on my proposal for mandatory minimum sentences for pushers of hard drugs will help ensure that convictions stemming from such arrests lead to actual imprisonment of the guilty.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Notwithstanding these gains, much more must be done. The resilience of the international drug trade remains grimly impressive—current estimates suggest that we still intercept only a small fraction of all the heroin and cocaine entering this country. Local police still find that more than one of every three suspects arrested for street crimes is a narcotic abuser or addict. And the total number of Americans addicted to narcotics, suffering terribly themselves and inflicting their suffering on countless others, still stands in the hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">A UNIFIED COMMAND FOR DRUG ENFORCEMENT</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Seeking ways to intensify our counter-offensive against this menace, I am asking the Congress today to join with this Administration in strengthening and streamlining the Federal drug law enforcement effort.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Funding for this effort has increased sevenfold during the past five years, from $36 million in fiscal year 1969 to $257 million in fiscal year 1974—more money is not the most pressing enforcement need at present. Nor is there a primary need for more manpower working on the problem, over 2100 new agents having already been added to the Federal drug enforcement agencies under this Administration, an increase of more than 250 percent over the 1969 level.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The enforcement work could benefit significantly, however, from consolidation of our anti-drug forces under a single unified command. Right now the Federal Government is fighting the war on drug abuse under a distinct handicap, for its efforts are those of a loosely confederated alliance facing a resourceful, elusive, worldwide enemy. Admiral Mahan, the master naval strategist, described this handicap precisely when he wrote that “Granting the same aggregate of force, it is never as great in two hands as in one, because it is not perfectly concentrated.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">More specifically, the drug law enforcement activities of the United States now are not merely in two hands but in half a dozen. Within the Department of Justice, with no overall direction below the level of the Attorney General, these fragmented forces include the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence, and certain activities of the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration. The Treasury Department is also heavily engaged in enforcement work through the Bureau of Customs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This aggregation of Federal activities has grown up rapidly over the past few years in response to the urgent need for stronger anti-drug measures. It has enabled us to make a very encouraging beginning in the accelerated drug enforcement drive of this Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">But it also has serious operational and organizational shortcomings. Certainly the cold-blooded underworld networks that funnel narcotics from suppliers all over the world into the veins of American drug victims are no respecters of the bureaucratic dividing lines that now complicate our anti-drug efforts. On the contrary, these modern-day slave traders can derive only advantage from the limitations of the existing organizational patchwork. Experience has now given us a good basis for correcting those limitations, and it is time to do so.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I therefore propose creation of a single, comprehensive Federal agency within the Department of Justice to lead the war against illicit drug traffic.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973, which I am transmitting to the Congress with this message, would establish such an agency, to be called the Drug Enforcement Administration. It would be headed by an Administrator reporting directly to the Attorney General.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Drug Enforcement Administration would carry out the following anti-drug functions, and would absorb the associated manpower and budgets:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—All functions of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (which would be abolished as a separate entity by the reorganization plan);</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Those functions of the Bureau of Customs pertaining to drug investigations and intelligence (to be transferred from the Treasury Department to the Attorney General by the reorganization plan);</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—All functions of the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—All functions of the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Merger of the latter two organizations into the new agency would be effected by an executive order dissolving them and transferring their functions, to take effect upon approval of Reorganization Plan No. 2 by the Congress. Drug law enforcement research currently funded by the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration and other agencies would also be transferred to the new agency by executive action.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The major responsibilities of the Drug Enforcement Administration would thus include:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—development of overall Federal drug law enforcement strategy, programs, planning, and evaluation;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects for violations under all Federal drug trafficking laws;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—full investigation and preparation for prosecution of suspects connected with illicit drugs seized at U.S. ports-of-entry and international borders;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—conduct of all relations with drug law enforcement officials of foreign governments, under the policy guidance of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—full coordination and cooperation with State and local law enforcement officials on joint drug enforcement efforts; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—regulation of the legal manufacture of drugs and other controlled substances under Federal regulations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Attorney General, working closely with the Administrator of this new agency, would have authority to make needed program adjustments. He would take steps within the Department of Justice to ensure that high priority emphasis is placed on the prosecution and sentencing of drug traffickers following their apprehension by the enforcement organization. He would also have the authority and responsibility for securing the fullest possible cooperation—particularly with respect to collection of drug intelligence—from all Federal departments and agencies which can contribute to the anti-drug work, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">My proposals would make possible a more effective anti-drug role for the FBI, especially in dealing with the relationship between drug trafficking and organized crime. I intend to see that the resources of the FBI are fully committed to assist in supporting the new Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The consolidation effected under Reorganization Plan No. 2 would reinforce the basic law enforcement and criminal justice mission of the Department of Justice. With worldwide drug law enforcement responsibilities no longer divided among several organizations in two different Cabinet departments, more complete and cumulative drug law enforcement intelligence could be compiled. Patterns of international and domestic illicit drug production, distribution, and sale could be more directly compared and interpreted. Case-by-case drug law enforcement activities could be more comprehensively linked, cross-referenced, and coordinated into a single, organic enforcement operation. In short, drug law enforcement officers would be able to spend more time going after the traffickers and less time coordinating with one another.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Such progress could be especially helpful on the international front. Narcotics control action plans, developed under the leadership of the Cabinet Committee on International Narcotics Control, are now being carried out by U.S. officials in cooperation with host governments in 59 countries around the world. This wide-ranging effort to cut off drug supplies before they ever reach U.S. borders or streets is just now beginning to bear fruit. We can enhance its effectiveness, with little disruption of ongoing enforcement activities, by merging both the highly effective narcotics force of overseas Customs agents and the rapidly developing international activities of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs into the Drug Enforcement Administration. The new agency would work closely with the Cabinet Committee under the active leadership of the U.S. Ambassador in each country where anti-drug programs are underway.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Two years ago, when I established the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention within the Executive Office of the President, we gained an organization with the necessary resources, breadth, and leadership capacity to begin dealing decisively with the “demand” side of the drug abuse problem—treatment and rehabilitation for those who have been drug victims, and preventive programs for potential drug abusers. This year, by permitting my reorganization proposals to take effect, the Congress can help provide a similar capability on the “supply” side. The proposed Drug Enforcement Administration, working as a team with the Special Action Office, would arm Americans with a potent one-two punch to help us fight back against the deadly menace of drug abuse. I ask full Congressional cooperation in its establishment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">IMPROVING PORT-OF-ENTRY INSPECTIONS</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">No heroin or cocaine is produced within the United States; domestic availability of these substances results solely from their illegal importation. The careful and complete inspection of all persons and goods coming into the United States is therefore an integral part of effective Federal drug law enforcement.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">At the present time, however, Federal responsibility for conducting port-of-entry inspections is awkwardly divided among several Cabinet departments. The principal agencies involved are the Treasury Department’s Bureau of Customs, which inspects goods, and the Justice Department’s Immigration and Naturalization Service, which inspects persons and their papers. The two utilize separate inspection procedures, hold differing views of inspection priorities, and employ dissimilar personnel management practices.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To reduce the possibility that illicit drugs will escape detection at ports-of-entry because of divided responsibility, and to enhance the effectiveness of the Drug Enforcement Administration, the reorganization plan which I am proposing today would transfer to the Secretary of the Treasury all functions currently vested in Justice Department officials to inspect persons, or the documents of persons.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">When the plan takes effect, it is my intention to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to use the resources so transferred—including some 1,000 employees of the Immigration and Naturalization Service—to augment the staff and budget of the Bureau of Customs. The Bureau’s primary responsibilities would then include:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—inspection of all persons and goods entering the United States;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—valuation of goods being imported, and assessment of appropriate tariff duties;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—interception of contraband being smuggled into the United States;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—enforcement of U.S. laws governing the international movement of goods, except the investigation of contraband drugs and narcotics; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—turning over the investigation responsibility for all drug law enforcement cases to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The reorganization would thus group most port-of-entry inspection functions in a single Cabinet department. It would reduce the need for much day-to-day interdepartmental coordination, allow more efficient staffing at some field locations, and remove the basis for damaging inter-agency rivalries. It would also give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority and flexibility to meet changing requirements in inspecting the international flow of people and goods. An important by-product of the change would be more convenient service for travellers entering and leaving the country.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">For these reasons, I am convinced that inspection activities at U.S. ports-of-entry can more effectively support our drug law enforcement efforts if concentrated in a single agency. The processing of persons at ports-of-entry is too closely interrelated with the inspection of goods to remain organizationally separated from it any longer. Both types of inspections have numerous objectives besides drug law enforcement, so it is logical to vest them in the Treasury Department, which has long had the principal responsibility for port-of-entry inspection of goods, including goods being transported in connection with persons. As long as the inspections are conducted with full awareness of related drug concerns it is neither necessary nor desirable that they be made a responsibility of the primary drug enforcement organization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I71" class="centered">DECLARATIONS</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found that each action included in Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">Section 901(a) of Title 5</ref> of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1): “to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;” Section 901(a)(3): “to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;” Section 901(a)(5): “to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government;” and Section 901(a)(6): “to eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As required by law, the plan has one logically consistent subject matter: consolidation of Federal drug law enforcement activities in a manner designed to increase their effectiveness.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan would establish in the Department of Justice a new Administration designated as the Drug Enforcement Administration. The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in Section 5 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers would be comparable to those fixed for officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which may result from the actions proposed, some savings may be anticipated in administrative costs now associated with the functions being transferred and consolidated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proposed reorganization is a necessary step in upgrading the effectiveness of our Nation’s drug law enforcement effort. Both of the proposed changes would build on the strengths of established agencies, yielding maximum gains in the battle against drug abuse with minimum loss of time and momentum in the transition.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I herewith transmit my plan for the Reorganization of the Executive Office of the President (EOP), Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977. This plan is the first of a series I intend to submit under the reorganization authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act of 1977 (<ref href="/us/pl/95/17">Public Law 95–17</ref>) [<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901–912">5 U.S.C. 901–912</ref>]. It adheres to the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of the Act [<ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">5 U.S.C. 901(a)</ref>].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan in conjunction with the other steps I am taking will:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Eliminate seven of the seventeen units now within the EOP and modify the rest. There were 19 units when I took office; the President’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Economic Policy Board have already been abolished. Thus with this plan I will have eliminated nine of 19 EOP units.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Reduce EOP staffing by about 250 which includes the White House staff reduction of 134 or 28 percent which I have already ordered.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Improve efficiency by centralizing administrative functions; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Improve the process by which information is provided for Presidential decisionmaking.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These recommendations arise from a careful, systematic study of the EOP. They are based on the premise that the EOP exists to serve the President and should be structured to meet his needs. They will reduce waste and cost while improving the service the President, and the nation, receive from the EOP.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The EOP now consists of the immediate White House Office, the Vice President’s Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and fourteen other agencies. The EOP has a budget authority of about $80,000,000 and 1,712 full time employees.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The White House Office concentrates on close personal support including policy and political advice and administrative and operational services. The Office of the Vice President provides similar support to him. OMB’s primary mission is to develop and implement the budget; it also carries out a number of management and reorganization activities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Three EOP units have responsibility for policy development:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">National Security Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Domestic Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Council on International Economic Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The other 11 are more specialized offices that offer analysis and advice, help develop policy in certain areas, or carry out special projects. These are:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Council on Wage and Price Stability.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Office of Drug Abuse Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Office of Telecommunications Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Intelligence Oversight Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Federal Property Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Energy Resources Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Economic Opportunity Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To make the EOP more effective, four steps are necessary:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">I. Strengthen management of policy issues.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">II. Limit the EOP, wherever possible, to functions directly related to the President’s work.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">III. Centralize administrative services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">IV. Reduce size of White House and EOP staffs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">i. strengthen process management of policy issues</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Perhaps the most important function of the President’s staff is to make sure he has the wide variety of views and facts he needs to make decisions. By building a more orderly system for collecting information and advice, the President can make sure that he will hear all the views he should—and hear them in time. To better insure that this happens, I am taking the following actions to:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Institute for domestic and economic issues, a system similar to the Presidential Review Memorandum process currently used for National Security issues.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Create a committee of Presidential advisers, chaired by the Vice President, to set priorities among issues and oversee their staffing.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Assure that Presidential decision memoranda on policy issues are coordinated with Cabinet and EOP advisers most involved with the issue.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Consolidate under the Staff Secretary the two current White House paper circulation systems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Appoint a group of advisers to review the decisionmaking process periodically.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Give the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy clear responsibility for managing the way in which domestic and most economic policy issues are prepared for Presidential decision.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Assign follow-up responsibility for Presidential decisions as follows: immediate follow-up will be handled by the NSC or Domestic Policy Staff most directly involved in the issue; long term follow-up on selected issues will be handled by the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These actions recognize that the White House and Executive Office staff must use their proximity to the President to insure that the full resources of the government and the public are brought to bear on Presidential decisions in a timely fashion. It is my purpose in instituting these changes to strengthen Cabinet participation in Presidential decisions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">ii. rationalize eop structure by limiting eop, wherever possible, to functions which bear a close relationship to the work of the president</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As the President’s principal staff institution, there are several major things the EOP must do:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Provide day-to-day operational support (e.g. scheduling, appointments) and help the President communicate with the public, the Congress, and the press.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Manage the budget and coordinate Administration positions on matters before the Congress.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Manage the Presidential decisionmaking processes efficiently and fairly, and bring the President the widest possible range of opinions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Help the President: plan and set priorities; monitor and evaluate progress toward achieving the President’s objectives; understand and resolve major conflicts among line subordinates; manage crises, especially in national security matters.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In order to restructure the EOP around these basic functions, the functions of seven units should be discontinued or transferred, and ten units, including the White House Office, should be retained but modified.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Seven units should be discontinued or their functions transferred. These are:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">1. Office of Drug Abuse Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">2. Office of Telecommunications Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">3. Council on International Economic Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">4. Federal Property Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">5. Energy Resources Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">6. Economic Opportunity Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">7. Domestic Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Policy (ODAP) can be performed by a smaller staff reporting to a Presidential adviser in the EOP. The Office itself will be discontinued.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Much of the work done by the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) can be more effectively performed outside the EOP. It is important that the EOP have the capacity to resolve differences and that the President have immediate advice on telecommunications and information policy, especially on national security, emergency preparedness and privacy issues. This only requires a small staff within EOP. The Office of Management and Budget would take responsibility for Federal telecommunications procurement and management policy and arbitration of interagency disputes about frequency allocation. All other functions except developing Presidential policy options would be transferred to a new office within the Department of Commerce, headed by a new Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, who will perform many of the functions previously performed by the head of the OTP.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose that the Economic Opportunity Council be discontinued; it is dormant and its only active function (preparation of the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance) is being performed by OMB. Three other units are also inactive and should be discontinued: Council on International Economic Policy, the Federal Property Council, and the Energy Resources Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Domestic Council should be abolished. It has rarely functioned as a Council, because it is too large and its membership too diverse to make decisions efficiently. Its functions have been performed entirely by its staff. This Domestic Policy Staff should report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy. Under the policy process system described earlier, they should manage the process which coordinates the making of domestic and most economic policy. They should work closely with the Cabinet departments and agencies to insure that the views of the Cabinet and agency heads are brought to the President before decisions are made.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The ten EOP units which will continue with some modification are:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">1. White House Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">2. Office of the Vice President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">3. Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">4. Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">5. Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">6. Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">7. Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">8. National Security Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">9. Intelligence Oversight Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">10. Council on Wage and Price Stability.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The operations of the Office of the Vice President reflect the combination of constitutional, statutory, and Presidentially assigned duties that make it unique among EOP units. Because his interests and assignments cover the same range as the President’s, the Vice President requires a staff with expertise in diverse areas. Its basic functions should not be changed. However, I propose that certain support functions—involving accounting, personnel services, and supply—be transferred to a centralized EOP Administrative Unit.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Office of Management and Budget would remain as a separate entity in the EOP, but some functional changes should be made. Four functions should be transferred from OMB to other parts of the government:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Administration to the new EOP Central Administrative Unit;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Executive Department/Labor Relations (except for Pay Agent, Executive Level Pools, and Legislative Analysis) to the Civil Service Commission;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Advisory Committee Management Secretariat to the General Services Administration;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Statistical Policy (except Forms Clearance) to the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I have asked the OMB to reorganize its management arm to emphasize major Presidential initiatives, such as reorganization, program evaluation, paperwork reduction, and regulatory reform.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) should remain in the EOP as an environmental adviser to the President. The CEQ’s major purpose is to provide an independent assessment of our policies for improving the environment. Toward this end, it will analyze long term trends and conditions in the environment. It will advise OMB on the reorganization of natural resources functions within the Federal Government. The Council will retain the functions it now has under NEPA and Executive Order No. 11514 with the exception of routine review of the adequacy of impact statements and the administrative aspects of their receipt and handling. The EPA will take over CEQ’s evaluation responsibility under the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research Development Act of 1974 [section 5901 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare]. The CEQ will continue to review and publish the Annual Report on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The strength of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) lies in its economic analysis of current policy choices. It also presents objective economic data, makes macroeconomic forecasts, and analyzes economic trends and their impact on the national economy. It will continue with a small reduction in staff.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should retain those science, engineering, and technology functions which can be so useful in helping the President and his advisers make decisions about policy and budget issues. Instead of the Intergovernmental Science, Engineering, and Technology Advisory Panels, the President should rely on an intergovernmental relations working group, chaired by the Science Adviser. The Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Technology should operate as a sub-Cabinet working group chaired by the Science Adviser. The reorganization work of the President’s Committee on Science and Technology would be part of the overall reorganization effort. The responsibility for preparing certain reports should be transferred to the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The proposal places manageable limits on OSTP’s broad mandate while emphasizing functions that support the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations (STR) is now operating effectively and will be retained essentially as is. With the difficult negotiations now underway in Geneva, the benefits of transferring the STR to another agency are outweighed by the potential reduction in its effectiveness as an international negotiator.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The National Security Council (NSC) will be retained in its present form and its staff slightly reduced.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) should be retained to insure that abuses of the past are not repeated and to emphasize Presidential concerns regarding intelligence issues.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Council of Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) is a necessary weapon in the continuing fight against inflation and will be retained. To be sure that its work is closely coordinated with the economic analyses performed by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), COWPS should be directed by the Chairman of CEA.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">iii. centralize administrative functions</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">About 380 (22 percent) of the full-time, permanent EOP personnel perform administrative support services in EOP units. Most EOP units besides the White House and OMB are too small to provide a full complement of administrative services. They depend on the White House, OMB, GSA, other federal departments, or several of these sources for many of these services. This approach is inefficient; the quality is uneven and the coordination poor. Some services are duplicated, others inconsistently distributed (excess capacity in some units and deficiencies in others), and most too costly.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to combine administrative support operations into a Central Administrative Unit in EOP to provide support in administrative services common to all EOP entities. It should be a separate EOP entity because of the need to assure equal access by all other units.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This consolidation will result in:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Saving of roughly 40 positions and about $1.1 million improved and more innovative services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">A focus for monitoring the efficiency and responsibility of administrative services.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">A base for an effective EOP budget/planning system through which the President can manage an integrated EOP rather than a collection of disparate units.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The EOP has never before been organized as a single, unified entity serving the President. It is only by viewing it as a whole that we can improve efficiency through steps like the Central Administrative Unit.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">iv. reduce the size of white house and eop staffs</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am reducing the White House staff by 28 percent, from the 485 I inherited from my predecessor to 351. This involves cuts in my policy and administrative staffs as well as transfers to the Central Administrative Unit.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I estimate that this plan and the other steps I am taking will reduce staff levels in the EOP by about 250, from 1,712 full-time permanent positions to about 1,460 and will save the taxpayers at least $6 million.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As in the rest of the government, I will be reluctant to add staff unless necessary to help me do my job better.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I ask that you support me in improving the operations of the Executive Office of the President by approving the attached reorganization plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In summary this plan would:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Abolish the Domestic Council and establish a Domestic Policy Staff.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Establish within the EOP a Central Administrative Unit.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Transfer certain functions of the Council on Environmental Quality to the President for redelegation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Abolish the Office of Drug Abuse Policy and vest functions in the President for redelegation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Abolish the Office of Telecommunications Policy and transfer functions to the Department of Commerce and to the President for redelegation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Create an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Vest some Office of Science and Technology Policy functions in the President for redelegation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Abolish the Economic Opportunity Council and vest those functions in the President for redelegation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Transfer the Committee Management Secretariat function of the Office of Management and Budget to the President for redelegation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Make other incidental transfers attendant to those mentioned above.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each of the changes set forth in the plan accompanying this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">Section 901(a) of Title 5</ref> of the United States Code. I have taken care to determine that all functions abolished by the plan are done so only under statutory authority provided by <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s903/b">Section 903(b) of Title 5</ref> of the United States Code. The provisions in the plan for the appointment and pay of any head or officer of any agency have been found by me to be necessary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As we continue our studies of other parts of the Executive Branch, we will find more ways to improve services in the EOP and elsewhere. This plan is only a beginning, but I am confident that it represents a major step toward a more efficient government that will serve the needs of the people and the President well.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1977 to consolidate certain international communication, educational and cultural, and broadcasting activities of the United States Government. I am acting under the authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act, chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code. I am also acting pursuant to section 501 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1978 (<ref href="/us/pl/95/105">Public Law 95–105</ref>) [<date date="1977-08-17">Aug. 17, 1977</date>, <ref href="/us/stat/91/857">91 Stat. 857</ref>], which provides that my recommendations for reorganizing these activities be transmitted by <date date="1977-10-31">October 31, 1977</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization will consolidate into a new agency, to be known as the Agency for International Communication, the functions now exercised by the State Department’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs and the United States Information Agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The principal aspects of this proposal are:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The new agency will take over USIA’s international communications programs (including the Voice of America) and the international educational and cultural exchange activities now conducted by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The agency’s Director will be the principal advisor on international information and exchange activities to the President, the National Security Council, and the Secretary of State. Under the direction of the Secretary of State, the Director will have primary responsibility within the Government for the conduct of such activities. The Director, the Deputy Director and the Associate Directors of the new agency will be confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The two commissions that now advise USIA and the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs will be combined into a single seven-member commission. Members of this nonpartisan commission will be chosen from fields related to the agency’s mission. The commissioners will be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The purpose of this reorganization is to broaden our informational, educational and cultural intercourse with the world, since this is the major means by which our government can inform others about our country, and inform ourselves about the rest of the world.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Agency for International Communication will play a central role in building these two-way bridges of understanding between our people and the other peoples of the world. Only by knowing and understanding each other’s experiences can we find common ground on which we can examine and resolve our differences.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new agency will have two distinct but related goals:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">To tell the world about our society and policies—in particular our commitment to cultural diversity and individual liberty.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">To tell ourselves about the world, so as to enrich our own culture as well as to give us the understanding to deal effectively with problems among nations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As the world becomes more and more interdependent, such mutual understanding becomes increasingly vital. The aim of this reorganization, therefore, is a more effective dialogue among peoples of the earth. Americans—mostly immigrants or the descendants of immigrants—are particularly well suited to enter into such an undertaking. We have already learned much from those who have brought differing values, perspectives and experiences to our shores. And we must continue to learn.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Thus the new agency will lay heavy emphasis on listening to others, so as to learn something of their motivations and aspirations, their histories and cultures.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Several principles guided me in shaping this reorganization plan. Among the most important were:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Maintaining the integrity of the educational and cultural exchange programs is imperative. To this end, the plan retains the Board of Foreign Scholarships, whose strong leadership has done so much to insure the high quality of the educational exchange program. In addition, I intend to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of educational and cultural functions consolidated in the new Agency. The responsibilities presently exercised by the Department of State in relation to the Center for Technical and Cultural Interchange Between East and West, Inc., will be transferred to the new agency without alteration.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Keeping the Voice of America’s news gathering and reporting functions independent and objective. The Voice’s charter, enacted into law in 1976, provides that “VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive”; that VOA will “present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions”; and that VOA will present U.S. policies “clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussion and opinion on these policies.” Under this Administration, VOA will be solely responsible for the content of news broadcasts—for there is no more valued coin than candor in the international marketplace of ideas. I also plan to nominate an Associate Director who will be responsible for the administration and supervision of the Voice of America.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—The new agency’s activities must be straightforward, open, candid, balanced, and representative. They will not be given over to the advancement of the views of any one group, any one party or any one Administration. The agency must not operate in a covert, manipulative or propagandistic way.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Rights of U.S. Information Agency and State Department employees must be respected. In the new agency, their career achievements will be recognized and the best possible use made of their professional skills and abilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Director of the new agency will assess and advise on the impact on worldwide public opinion of American foreign policy decisions. The Agency will coordinate the international information, educational, cultural and exchange programs conducted by the U.S. Government and will be a governmental focal point for private U.S. international exchange programs. It will also play a leading role within the U.S. Government in our efforts to remove barriers to the international exchange of ideas and information.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies that will result from the proposed reorganization, and therefore I do not do so. The reorganization will result in greater efficiency by unifying in Washington the management of programs which are already administered in a consolidated manner in the field. For example, field officers will no longer report to two separate sets of supervisors and headquarters at home.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan abolishes the functions of the Advisory Committee on the Arts authorized by section 106(c) of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t22/s2456/c">22 U.S.C. 2456(c)</ref>). Also abolished, as a result of the consolidation of certain functions of the United States Advisory Commission on Information and the United States Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs in the United States Advisory Commission on International Communication, Cultural and Educational Affairs, are the functions authorized by section 603 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, as amended (<ref href="/us/usc/t22/s1468">22 U.S.C. 1468</ref>) (requiring submission by the United States Advisory Commission on Information of a quarterly report to the Director of USIA and a semiannual report to the Congress). The new commission will report annually and at such other times as it deems appropriate (as does the existing Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs). Since appointments of all members of the new commission will be on a nonpartisan basis, as has been the case with the Advisory Commission on International Educational and Cultural Affairs, the requirement of section 602(a) of the U.S. Information and Educational Exchange Act (<ref href="/us/usc/t22/s1467/a">22 U.S.C. 1467(a)</ref>) that not more than three members of the Advisory Commission on Information shall be of the same political party is abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Various obsolete or superseded functions under Reorganization Plan No. 8 of 1953 (<ref href="/us/usc/t22/s1461">22 U.S.C. 1461</ref> note), which created the USIA, are superseded by this plan. Finally, the Plan abolishes a provision authorizing the Secretary of State to pay the expenses of transporting the bodies of participants in exchange programs who die away from home, since State no longer will conduct such programs (<ref href="/us/usc/t22/s2670/e">22 U.S.C. 2670(e)</ref>). All functions abolished by the reorganization are done so in compliance with <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s903/b">section 903(b) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After investigation, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to carry out the policy set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. The provisions in this Plan for the appointment and pay of the Director, Deputy Director, and Associate Directors of the Agency have been found by me to be necessary by reason of the reorganization made by the plan and are at a rate applicable to comparable officers in the executive branch.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am submitting to you today Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978. This Plan makes the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the principal Federal agency in fair employment enforcement. Together with actions I shall take by Executive Order, it consolidates Federal equal employment opportunity activities and lays, for the first time, the foundation of a unified, coherent Federal structure to combat job discrimination in all its forms.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In 1940 President Roosevelt issued the first Executive Order forbidding discrimination in employment by the Federal government. Since that time the Congress, the courts and the Executive Branch—spurred by the courage and sacrifice of many people and organizations—have taken historic steps to extend equal employment opportunity protection throughout the private as well as public sector. But each new prohibition against discrimination unfortunately has brought with it a further dispersal of Federal equal employment opportunity responsibility. This fragmentation of authority among a number of Federal agencies has meant confusion and ineffective enforcement for employees, regulatory duplication and needless expense for employers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Fair employment is too vital for haphazard enforcement. My Administration will aggressively enforce our civil rights laws. Although discrimination in any area has severe consequences, limiting economic opportunity affects access to education, housing and health care. I, therefore, ask you to join with me to reorganize administration of the civil rights laws and to begin that effort by reorganizing the enforcement of those laws which ensure an equal opportunity to a job.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Eighteen government units now exercise important responsibilities under statutes, Executive Orders and regulations relating to equal employment opportunity:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</i> (EEOC) enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s2000e">42 U.S.C. 2000e</ref> et seq.], which bans employment discrimination based on race, national origin, sex or religion. The EEOC acts on individual complaints and also initiates private sector cases involving a “pattern or practice” of discrimination.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>The Department of Labor</i> and 11 other agencies enforce Executive Order 11246 [set out as a note under <ref href="/us/usc/t42/s2000e">42 U.S.C. 2000e</ref>]. This prohibits discrimination in employment on the basis of race, national origin, sex, or religion and requires affirmative action by government contractors. While the Department now coordinates enforcement of this “contract compliance” program, it is actually administered by eleven other departments and agencies. The Department also administers those statutes requiring contractors to take affirmative action to employ handicapped people, disabled veterans and Vietnam veterans.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition, the Labor Department enforces the Equal Pay Act of 1963 [<ref href="/us/usc/t29/s206/d">29 U.S.C. 206(d)</ref>], which prohibits employers from paying unequal wages based on sex, and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 [<ref href="/us/usc/t29/s621">29 U.S.C. 621</ref> et seq.], which forbids age discrimination against persons between the ages of 40 and 65.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>The Department of Justice</i> litigates Title VII cases involving public sector employers—State and local governments. The Department also represents the Federal government in lawsuits against Federal contractors and grant recipients who are in violation of Federal nondiscrimination prohibitions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>The Civil Service Commission</i> (CSC) enforces Title VII and all other nondiscrimination and affirmative action requirements for Federal employment. The CSC rules on complaints filed by individuals and monitors affirmative action plans submitted annually by other Federal agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>The Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council</i> includes representatives from EEOC, Labor, Justice, CSC and the Civil Rights Commission. It is charged with coordinating the Federal equal employment opportunity enforcement effort and with eliminating overlap and inconsistent standards.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to these major government units, other agencies enforce various equal employment opportunity requirements which apply to specific grant programs. The Department of Treasury, for example, administers the anti-discrimination prohibitions applicable to recipients of revenue sharing funds.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These programs have had only limited success. Some of the past deficiencies include:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—inconsistent standards of compliance;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—duplicative, inconsistent paperwork requirements and investigative efforts;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—conflicts within agencies between their program responsibilities and their responsibility to enforce the civil rights laws;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—confusion on the part of workers about how and where to seek redress;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—lack of accountability.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am proposing today a series of steps to bring coherence to the equal employment enforcement effort. These steps, to be accomplished by the Reorganization Plan and Executive Orders, constitute an important step toward consolidation of equal employment opportunity enforcement. They will be implemented over the next two years, so that the agencies involved may continue their internal reform.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Its experience and broad scope make the EEOC suitable for the role of principal Federal agency in fair employment enforcement. Located in the Executive Branch and responsible to the President, the EEOC has developed considerable expertise in the field of employment discrimination since Congress created it by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s2000e–4">42 U.S.C. 2000e–4</ref>]. The Commission has played a pioneer role in defining both employment discrimination and its appropriate remedies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While it has had management problems in past administrations, the EEOC’s new leadership is making substantial progress in correcting them. In the last seven months the Commission has redesigned its internal structures and adopted proven management techniques. Early experience with these procedures indicates a high degree of success in reducing and expediting new cases. At my direction, the Office of Management and Budget is actively assisting the EEOC to ensure that these reforms continue.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Reorganization Plan I am submitting will accomplish the following:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1978-07-01">July 1, 1978</date>, abolish the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council (<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s2000e–14">42 U.S.C. 2000e–14</ref>) and transfer its duties to the EEOC (no positions or funds shifted).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1978-10-01">October 1, 1978</date>, shift enforcement of equal employment opportunity for Federal employees from the CSC to the EEOC (100 positions and $6.5 million shifted).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On <date date="1979-07-01">July 1, 1979</date>, shift responsibility for enforcing both the Equal Pay Act and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act from the Labor Department to the EEOC (198 positions and $5.3 million shifted for Equal Pay; 119 positions and $3.5 million for Age Discrimination).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Clarify the Attorney General’s authority to initiate “pattern or practice” suits under Title VII in the public sector.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition, I will issue an Executive Order on <date date="1978-10-01">October 1, 1978</date>, to consolidate the contract compliance program—now the responsibility of Labor and eleven “compliance agencies”—into the Labor Department (1,517 positions and $33.1 million shifted).</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These proposed transfers and consolidations reduce from fifteen to three the number of Federal agencies having important equal employment opportunity responsibilities under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Federal contract compliance provisions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each element of my Plan is important to the success of the entire proposal.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By abolishing the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council and transferring its responsibilities to the EEOC, this plan places the Commission at the center of equal employment opportunity enforcement. With these new responsibilities, the EEOC can give coherence and direction to the government’s efforts by developing strong uniform enforcement standards to apply throughout the government: standardized data collection procedures, joint training programs, programs to ensure the sharing of enforcement related data among agencies, and methods and priorities for complaint and compliance reviews. Such direction has been absent in the Equal Employment Opportunity Coordinating Council.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It should be stressed, however, that affected agencies will be consulted before EEOC takes any action. When the Plan has been approved, I intend to issue an Executive Order which will provide for consultation, as well as a procedure for reviewing major disputed issues within the Executive Office of the President. The Attorney General’s responsibility to advise the Executive Branch on legal issues will also be preserved.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Transfer of the Civil Service Commission’s equal employment opportunity responsibilities to EEOC is needed to ensure that: (1) Federal employees have the same rights and remedies as those in the private sector and in State and local government; (2) Federal agencies meet the same standards as are required of other employers; and (3) potential conflicts between an agency’s equal employment opportunity and personnel management functions are minimized. The Federal government must not fall below the standard of performance it expects of private employers.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Civil Service Commission has in the past been lethargic in enforcing fair employment requirements within the Federal government. While the Chairman and other Commissioners I have appointed have already demonstrated their personal commitment to expanding equal employment opportunity, responsibility for ensuring fair employment for Federal employees should rest ultimately with the EEOC.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We must ensure that the transfer in no way undermines the important objectives of the comprehensive civil service reorganization which will be submitted to Congress in the near future. When the two plans take effect, I will direct the EEOC and the CSC to coordinate their procedures to prevent any duplication and overlap.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Equal Pay Act now administered by the Labor Department, prohibits employers from paying unequal wages based on sex. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which is enforced by EEOC, contains a broader ban on sex discrimination. The transfer of Equal Pay responsibility from the Labor Department to the EEOC will minimize overlap and centralize enforcement of statutory prohibitions against sex discrimination in employment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The transfer will strengthen efforts to combat sex discrimination. Such efforts would be enhanced still further by passage of the legislation pending before you, which I support, that would prohibit employers from excluding women disabled by pregnancy from participating in disability programs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">There is now virtually complete overlap in the employers, labor organizations, and employment agencies covered by Title VII and by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. This overlap is burdensome to employers and confusing to victims of discrimination. The proposed transfer of the age discrimination program from the Labor Department to the EEOC will eliminate the duplication.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan I am proposing will not affect the Attorney General’s responsibility to enforce Title VII against State or local governments or to represent the Federal government in suits against Federal contractors and grant recipients. In 1972, the Congress determined that the Attorney General should be involved in suits against State and local governments. This proposal reinforces that judgment and clarifies the Attorney General’s authority to initiate litigation against State or local governments engaged in a “pattern or practice” of discrimination. This in no way diminishes the EEOC’s existing authority to investigate complaints filed against State or local governments and, where appropriate, to refer them to the Attorney General. The Justice Department and the EEOC will cooperate so that the Department sues on valid referrals, as well as on its own “pattern or practice” cases.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">A critical element of my proposals will be accomplished by Executive Order rather than by the Reorganization Plan. This involves consolidation in the Labor Department of the responsibility to ensure that Federal contractors comply with Executive Order 11246. Consolidation will achieve the following: promote consistent standards, procedures, and reporting requirements; remove contractors from the jurisdiction of multiple agencies; prevent an agency’s equal employment objectives from being outweighed by its procurement and construction objectives; and produce more effective law enforcement through unification of planning, training and sanctions. By 1981, after I have had an opportunity to review the manner in which both the EEOC and the Labor Department are exercising their new responsibilities, I will determine whether further action is appropriate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Finally, the responsibility for enforcing grant-related equal employment provisions will remain with the agencies administering the grant programs. With the EEOC acting as coordinator of Federal equal employment programs, we will be able to bring overlap and duplication to a minimum. We will be able, for example, to see that a university’s employment practices are not subject to duplicative investigations under both Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 [section 1681 et seq. of Title 20, Education] and the contract compliance program. Because of the similarities between the Executive Order program and those statutes requiring Federal contractors to take affirmative action to employ handicapped individuals and disabled and Vietnam veterans, I have determined that enforcement of these statutes should remain in the Labor Department.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each of the changes set forth in the Reorganization Plan accompanying this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">Section 901(a) of Title 5</ref> of the United States Code. I have taken care to determine that all functions abolished by the Plan are done only under the statutory authority provided by <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s903/b">Section 903(b) of Title 5</ref> of the United States Code.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I do not anticipate that the reorganizations contained in this Plan will result in any significant change in expenditures. They will result in a more efficient and manageable enforcement program.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan I am submitting is moderate and measured. It gives the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission—an agency dedicated solely to this purpose—the primary Federal responsibility in the area of job discrimination, but it is designed to give this agency sufficient time to absorb its new responsibilities. This reorganization will produce consistent agency standards, as well as increased accountability. Combined with the intense commitment of those charged with these responsibilities, it will become possible for us to accelerate this Nation’s progress in ensuring equal job opportunities for all our people.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">On March 2nd I sent to Congress a Civil Service Reform proposal to enable the Federal government to improve its service to the American people.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today I am submitting another part of my comprehensive proposal to reform the Federal personnel management system through Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978. The plan will reorganize the Civil Service Commission and thereby create new institutions to increase the effectiveness of management and strengthen the protection of employee rights.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Civil Service Commission has acquired inherently conflicting responsibilities: to help manage the Federal Government and to protect the rights of Federal employees. It has done neither job well. The Plan would separate the two functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">office of personnel management</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The positive personnel management tasks of the government—such as training, productivity programs, examinations, and pay and benefits administration—would be the responsibility of an Office of Personnel Management. Its Director, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would be responsible for administering Federal personnel matters except for Presidential appointments. The Director would be the government’s principal representative in Federal labor relations matters.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">merit systems protection board</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The adjudication and prosecution responsibilities of the Civil Service Commission will be performed by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Board will be headed by a bipartisan panel of three members appointed to six-year, staggered terms. This Board would be the first independent and institutionally impartial Federal agency solely for the protection of Federal employees.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan will create, within the Board, a Special Counsel to investigate and prosecute political abuses and merit system violations. Under the civil service reform legislation now being considered by the Congress, the Counsel would have power to investigate and prevent reprisals against employees who report illegal acts—the so-called “whistleblowers.” The Council would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">federal labor relations authority</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">An Executive Order now vests existing labor-management relations in a part-time Federal Labor-Relations Council, comprised of three top government managers; other important functions are assigned to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations. This arrangement is defective because the Council members are part-time, they come exclusively from the ranks of management and their jurisdiction is fragmented.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan I submit today would consolidate the central policymaking functions in labor-management relations now divided between the Council and the Assistant Secretary into one Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Authority would be composed of three full-time members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Its General Counsel, also appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would present unfair labor practice complaints. The Plan also provides for the continuance of the Federal Service Impasses Panel within the Authority to resolve negotiating impasses between Federal employee unions and agencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The cost of replacing the Civil Service Commission can be paid by our present resources. The reorganization itself would neither increase nor decrease the costs of personnel management throughout the government. But taken together with the substantive reforms I have proposed, this Plan will greatly improve the government’s ability to manage programs, speed the delivery of Federal services to the public, and aid in executing other reorganizations I will propose to the Congress, by improving Federal personnel management.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">5 U.S.C. 901(a)</ref>. No functions are abolished by the Plan, but the offices referred to in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s5109/b">5 U.S.C. 5109(b)</ref> and <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s1103/d">5 U.S.C. 1103(d)</ref> are abolished. The portions of the Plan providing for the appointment and pay for the head and one or more officers of the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Federal Service Impasses Panel, are necessary to carry out the reorganization. The rates of compensation are comparable to those for similar positions within the Executive Branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am confident that this Plan and the companion civil service reform legislation will both lead to more effective protection of Federal employees’ legitimate rights and a more rewarding workplace. At the same time the American people will benefit from a better managed, more productive and more efficient Federal Government.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today I am transmitting Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1978. The plan improves Federal emergency management and assistance. By consolidating emergency preparedness, mitigation and response activities, it cuts duplicative administrative costs and strengthens our ability to deal effectively with emergencies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The plan, together with changes I will make through Executive action, would merge five agencies from the Departments of Defense, Commerce, HUD, and GSA into one new agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">For the first time, key emergency management and assistance functions would be unified and made directly accountable to the President and Congress. This will reduce pressures for increased costs to serve similar goals.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present situation has severely hampered Federal support of State and local emergency organizations and resources, which bear the primary responsibility for preserving life and property in times of calamity. This reorganization has been developed in close cooperation with State and local governments.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If approved by the Congress, the plan will establish the Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose Director shall report directly to the President. The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration (in the Department of Commerce), the Federal Insurance Administration (in the Department of Housing and Urban Development), and oversight responsibility for the Federal Emergency Broadcast System (now assigned in the Executive Office of the President) would be transferred to the Agency. The Agency’s Director, its Deputy Director, and its five principal program managers would be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">If the plan takes effect, I will assign to the Federal Emergency Management Agency all authorities and functions vested by law in the President and presently delegated to the Defense Civil Preparedness Agency (in the Department of Defense). This will include certain engineering and communications support functions for civil defense now assigned to the U.S. Army.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I will also transfer to the new Agency all authorities and functions under the Disaster Relief Acts of 1970 and 1974 [<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s4401">42 U.S.C. 4401</ref> et seq. and 5121 et seq.] now delegated to the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration in the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I will also transfer all Presidential authorities and functions now delegated to the Federal Preparedness Agency in the General Services Administration, including the establishment of policy for the national stockpile. The stockpile disposal function, which is stat­utorily assigned to the General Services Administration, would remain there. Once these steps have been taken by Executive Order, these three agencies would be abolished.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Several additional transfers of emergency preparedness and mitigation functions would complete the consolidation. These include:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Oversight of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, under <ref href="/us/pl/95/124">Public Law 95–124</ref> [<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s7701">42 U.S.C. 7701</ref> et seq.], now carried out by the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Coordination of Federal activities to promote dam safety, carried by the same Office.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Responsibility for assistance to communities in the development of readiness plans for severe weather-related emergencies, including floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Coordination of natural and nuclear disaster warning systems.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">Coordination of preparedness and planning to reduce the consequences of major terrorist incidents. This would not alter the present responsibility of the executive branch for reacting to the incidents themselves.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization rests on several fundamental principles:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>First, Federal authorities to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to major civil emergencies should be supervised by one official responsible to the President and given attention by other officials at the highest levels.</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new Agency would be in this position. To increase White House oversight and involvement still further, I shall establish by Executive Order an Emergency Management Committee, to be chaired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency Director. Its membership shall be comprised of the Assistants to the President for National Security, Domestic Affairs and Policy and Intergovernmental Relations, and the Director, Office of Management and Budget. It will advise the President on ways to meet national civil emergencies. It will also oversee and provide guidance on the management of all Federal emergency authorities, advising the President on alternative approaches to improve performance and avoid excessive costs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Second, an effective civil defense system requires the most efficient use of all available emergency resources</i>. At the same time, civil defense systems, organization, and resources must be prepared to cope with any disasters which threaten our people. The Congress has clearly recognized this principle in recent changes in the civil defense legislation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The communications, warning, evacuation, and public education processes involved in preparedness for a possible nuclear attack should be developed, tested, and used for major natural and accidental disasters as well. Consolidation of civil defense functions in the new Agency will assure that attack readiness programs are effectively integrated into the preparedness organizations and programs of State and local government, private industry, and volunteer organizations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">While serving an important “all hazards” readiness and response role, civil defense must continue to be fully compatible with and be ready to play an important role in our Nation’s overall strategic policy. Accordingly, to maintain a link between our strategic nuclear planning and our nuclear attack preparedness planning, I will make the Secretary of Defense and the National Security Council responsible for oversight of civil defense related programs and policies of the new Agency. This will also include appropriate Department of Defense support in areas like program development, technical support, research, communications, intelligence and emergency operations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Third, whenever possible, emergency responsibilities should be extensions of the regular missions of Federal agencies</i>. The primary task of the Federal Emergency Management Agency will be to coordinate and plan for the emergency deployment of resources that have other routine uses. There is no need to develop a separate set of Federal skills and capabilities for those rare occasions when catastrophe occurs.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Fourth, Federal hazard mitigation activities should be closely linked with emergency preparedness and response functions</i>. This reorganization would permit more rational decisions on the relative costs and benefits of alternative approaches to disasters by making the Federal Emergency Management Agency the focal point of all Federal hazard mitigation activities and by combining these with the key Federal preparedness and response functions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The affected hazard mitigation activities include the Federal Insurance Administration which seeks to reduce flood losses by assisting States and local governments in developing appropriate land uses and building standards and several agencies that presently seek to reduce fire and earthquake losses through research and education.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Most State and local governments have consolidated emergency planning, preparedness and response functions on an “all hazard” basis to take advantage of the similarities in preparing for and responding to the full range of potential emergencies. The Federal Government can and should follow this lead.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each of the changes set forth in the plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. The plan does not call for abolishing any functions now authorized by law. The provisions in the plan for the appointment and pay of any head or officer of the new agency have been found by me to be necessary.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I do not expect these actions to result in any significant changes in program expenditures for those authorities to be transferred. However, cost savings of between $10 to $15 million annually can be achieved by consolidating headquarters and regional facilities and staffs. The elimination (through attrition) of about 300 jobs is also anticipated.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The emergency planning and response authorities involved in this plan are vitally important to the security and well-being of our Nation. I urge the Congress to approve it.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Today I am submitting to the Congress my fourth Reorganization Plan for 1978. This proposal is designed to simplify and improve the unnecessarily complex administrative requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) [see Short Title note set out under <ref href="/us/usc/t29/s1001">29 U.S.C. 1001</ref>]. The new plan will eliminate overlap and duplication in the administration of ERISA and help us achieve our goal of well regulated private pension plans.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">ERISA was an essential step in the protection of worker pension rights. Its administrative provisions, however, have resulted in bureaucratic confusion and have been justifiably criticized by employers and unions alike. The biggest problem has been overlapping jurisdictional authority. Under current ERISA provisions, the Departments of Treasury and Labor both have authority to issue regulations and decisions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This dual jurisdiction has delayed a good many important rulings and, more importantly, produced bureaucratic runarounds and burdensome reporting requirements.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The new plan will significantly reduce these problems. In addition, both Departments are trying to cut red tape and paperwork, to eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements, and to streamline forms wher­ever possible.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Both Departments have already made considerable progress, and both will continue the effort to simplify their rules and their forms.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Reorganization Plan is the most significant result of their joint effort to modify and simplify ERISA. It will eliminate most of the jurisdictional overlap between Treasury and Labor by making the following changes:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">1) Treasury will have statutory authority for minimum standards. The new plan puts all responsibility for funding, participation, and vesting of benefit rights in the Department of Treasury. These standards are necessary to ensure that employee benefit plans are adequately funded and that all beneficiary rights are protected. Treasury is the most appropriate Department to administer these provisions; however, Labor will continue to have veto power over Treasury decisions that significantly affect collectively bargained plans.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">2) Labor will have statutory authority for fiduciary obligations. ERISA prohibits transactions in which self-interest or conflict of interest could occur, but allows certain exemptions from these prohibitions. Labor will be responsible for overseeing fiduciary conduct under these provisions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">3) Both Departments will retain enforcement powers. The Reorganization Plan will continue Treasury’s authority to audit plans and levy tax penalties for any deviation from standards. The plan will also continue Labor’s authority to bring civil action against plans and fiduciaries. These provisions are retained in order to keep the special expertise of each Department available. New coordination between the Departments will eliminate duplicative investigations of alleged violations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization will make an immediate improvement in ERISA’s administration. It will eliminate almost all of the dual and overlapping authority in the two departments and dramatically cut the time required to process applications for exemptions from prohibited transactions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan is an interim arrangement. After the Departments have had a chance to administer ERISA under this new plan, the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments will jointly evaluate that experience. Based on that evaluation, early in 1980, the Administration will make appropriate legislative proposals to establish a long-term administrative structure for ERISA.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each provision in this reorganization will accomplish one or more of the purposes in Title 5 of U.S.C. 901(a). There will be no change in expenditure or personnel levels, although a small number of people will be transferred from the Department of Treasury to the Department of Labor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We all recognize that the administration of ERISA has been unduly burdensome. I am confident that this reorganization will significantly relieve much of that burden.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This plan is the culmination of our effort to streamline ERISA. It provides an administrative arrangement that will work.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">ERISA has been a symbol of unnecessarily complex government regulation. I hope this new step will become equally symbolic of my Administration’s commitment to making government more effective and less intrusive in the lives of our people.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am submitting to you today Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1979 to create the Office of Federal Inspector for the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System and establish the position of Federal Inspector. Creation of this Office and the transfer of appropriate Federal enforcement authority and responsibility is consistent with my September 1977 Decision and Report to the Congress on the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System. This decision was approved by the Congress <date date="1977-11-02">November 2, 1977</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Alaska Gas Transportation System is a 4,748-mile pipeline to be constructed in partnership with Canada. Canada completed legislation enacting a similar transfer last year and has already appointed an official to coordinate its activities prior to and during pipeline construction. The Northwest Alaska Pipeline Company has been selected to construct the pipeline, with completion scheduled in late 1984. Estimated construction costs are $10–$15 billion, to be financed by private investment.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Natural gas is among the Nation’s most valuable fuels. It is the national interest to bring Alaskan gas reserves to market at the lowest possible price for consumers. Construction of a gas pipeline from the Prudhoe Bay reserves in Alaska through Canada to points in the West and Midwest United States will provide a system which will deliver more Alaskan natural gas at less cost to a greater number of Americans than any alternative transportation system. Every effort must be made to ensure timely completion of the pipeline at the lowest possible cost consistent with Federal regulatory policies.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As a result of our experience in construction of the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline, we recognize the need for the Federal Government to be in a strong position to manage its own role in this project through prompt, coordinated decisionmaking in pre-construction approval functions and in enforcing the terms and conditions of the permits, certificates, leases, and other authorizations to be issued by various Federal agencies. We must avoid duplicating the delays and cost escalations experienced in the construction of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System. The Plan I am submitting would establish clear responsibility for the efficient functioning of Federal enforcement activities by assigning the Federal Inspector authority to carry out these responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 [<ref href="/us/usc/t15/s719">15 U.S.C. 719</ref> et seq.] only provided for monitoring the construction of the pipeline. The Plan transfers to the Federal Inspector the authority to supervise the enforcement of terms and conditions of the permits and other authorizations, including those to be issued by the Departments of Agriculture, Interior, Transportation, and Treasury, and the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Plan provides for the Federal Inspector to coordinate other Federal activities directly related to the pipeline project. Federal agencies retain their authority to issue permits and related authorizations, but enforcement of the terms and conditions of these authorizations is transferred to the Federal Inspector. Transfer of enforcement authority from Federal agencies to the Federal Inspector is limited in scope to their participation in this project and in duration to the pre-construction, construction, and initial operation phases of the project.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Decision and Report to the Congress recommended an Executive Policy Board with policy-making and supervisory authority over the Federal Inspector. I plan to sign an Executive Order upon approval of this Plan by the Congress which will create an Executive Policy Board which will be only advisory, but which will enhance communication and coordinate among Federal agencies and with the Federal Inspector. The Plan modifies the Decision and Report in that regard. The Federal Inspector will use the policies and procedures of the agencies involved in exercising the transferred enforcement responsibilities to the maximum extent practicable. The Board provides the opportunity for agencies to contribute to the policy deliberations of the Inspector and exercises an oversight role to insure that pipeline activities are carried on within existing regulatory policy. The Board is required to review the budget of the Office of the Federal Inspector and periodically report to me on the progress of construction and on major problems encountered. I am convinced that the Federal Inspector must have authority commensurate with his responsibilities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">Section 901(a) of Title 5</ref> of the United States Code. The appointment and compensation of the Federal Inspector is in accordance with the provisions of the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 [<ref href="/us/usc/t15/s719">15 U.S.C. 719</ref> et seq.], and the Reorganization Act of 1977. The provisions for appointment and pay in this Plan are necessary by reason of a reorganization made by the Plan. The rate of compensation is comparable to rates for similar positions within the Executive Branch. This reorganization will result in a reduction in the cost of construction for the pipeline system and ultimately in savings to American consumers. A small increase in cost to the Federal government will result from the creation of the Office of the Federal Inspector. The Plan requires that the Office and the position of Federal Inspector will be abolished upon the first anniversary date after the pipeline becomes opera­tional.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1979, to consolidate trade functions of the United States Government. I am acting under the authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act of 1977, chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code, and pursuant to section 1109 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 [<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s2111">19 U.S.C. 2111</ref> note], which directs that I transmit to the Congress a proposal to restructure the international trade functions of the Executive branch.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The goal of this reorganization is to improve the capacity of the Government to strengthen the export performance of United States industry and to assure fair international trade practices, taking into account the interests of all elements of our economy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Recent developments, which have raised concern about the vitality of our international trade performance, have focused much attention on the way our trade machinery is organized. These developments include our negative trade balance, increasing dependence upon foreign oil, and international pressures on the dollar. New challenges, such as implementation of the Multilateral Trade Negotiation (MTN) agreements and trade with non-market economies, will further test our Government trade organization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">We must be prepared to apply domestically the MTN codes on procurement, subsidies, standards, and customs valuation. We also must monitor major implementation measures abroad, reporting back to American business on important developments and, where necessary, raising questions internationally about foreign implementation. MTN will work—will open new markets for U.S. labor, farmers, and business—only if we have adequate procedures for aggressively monitoring and enforcing it. We intend to meet our obligations, and we expect others to do the same.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The trade machinery we now have cannot do this job effectively. Although the Special Trade Representative (STR) takes the lead role in administering the trade agreements program, many issues are handled elsewhere and no agency has across-the-board leadership in trade. Aside from the Trade Representative and the Export-Import Bank, trade is not the primary concern of any Executive branch agency where trade functions are located. The current arrangements lack a central authority capable of planning a coherent trade strategy and assuring its vigorous implementation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization is designed to correct such deficiencies and to prepare us for strong enforcement of the MTN codes. It aims to improve our export promotion activities so that United States exporters can take full advantage of trade opportunities in foreign markets. It provides for the timely and efficient administration of our unfair trade laws. It also establishes an efficient mechanism for shaping an effective, comprehensive United States trade policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To achieve these objectives, I propose to place policy coordination and negotiation—those international trade functions that most require comprehensiveness, influence, and Government-wide perspective—in the Executive Office of the President. I propose to place operational and implementation responsibilities, which are staff-intensive, in line departments that have the requisite resources and knowledge of the major sectors of our economy to handle them. I have concluded that building our trade structure on STR and Commerce, respectively, best satisfies these considerations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to enhance STR, to be renamed the Office of the United States Trade Representative, by centralizing in it international trade policy development, coordination and negotiation functions. The Commerce Department will become the focus of non-agricultural operational trade responsibilities by adding to its existing duties those for commercial representation abroad, antidumping and countervailing duty cases, the non-agricultural aspects of MTN implementation, national security investigations, and embargoes.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">the united states trade representative</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Trade Representative, with the advice of the Trade Policy Committee, will be responsible for developing and coordinating our international trade and direct investment policy, including the following areas:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Import remedies.—</i>The Trade Representative will exercise policy oversight of the application of import remedies, analyze long-term trends in import remedy cases and recommend any necessary legislative changes. For antidumping and countervailing duty matters, such coordination, to the extent legally permissible, will be directed toward the establishment of new precedents, negotiation of assurances, and coordination with other trade matters, rather than case-by-case fact finding and determinations.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>East-West trade policy.—</i>The Trade Representative will have lead responsibility for East-West trade negotiations and will coordinate East-West trade policy. The Trade Policy Committee will assume the responsibilities of the East-West Foreign Trade Board.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>International investment policy.—</i>The Trade Representative will have the policy lead regarding issues of direct foreign investment in the United States, direct investment by Americans abroad, operations of multinational enterprises, and multilateral agreements on international investment, insofar as such issues relate to international trade.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>International commodity policy.—</i>The Trade Representative will assume responsibility for commodity negotiations and also will coordinate commodity policy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Energy trade.—</i>While the Departments of Energy and State will continue to share responsibility for international energy issues, the Trade Representative will coordinate energy trade matters. The Department of Energy will become a member of the TPC.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><i>Export-expansion policy.—</i>To ensure a vigorous and coordinated Government-wide export expansion effort, policy oversight of our export expansion activities will be the responsibility of the Trade Representative.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Trade Representative will have the lead role in bilateral and multilateral trade, commodity, and direct investment negotiations. The Trade Representative will represent the United States in General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) matters. Since the GATT will be the principal international forum for implementing and interpreting the MTN agreements and since GATT meetings, including committee and working group meetings, occur almost continuously, the Trade Representative will have a limited number of permanent staff in Geneva. In some cases, it may be necessary to assign a small number of USTR staff abroad to assist in oversight of MTN enforcement. In this event, appropriate positions will be authorized. In recognition of the responsibility of the Secretary of State regarding our foreign policy, the activities of overseas personnel of the Trade Representative and the Commerce Department will be fully coordinated with other elements of our diplomatic missions.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In addition to his role with regard to GATT matters, the Trade Representative will have the lead responsibility for trade and commodity matters considered in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) when such matters are the primary issues under negotiation. Because of the Secretary of State’s foreign policy responsibilities, and the responsibilities of the Director of the International Development Cooperation Agency as the President’s principal advisor on development, the Trade Representative will exercise his OECD and UNCTAD responsibilities in close cooperation with these officials.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To ensure that all trade negotiations are handled consistently and that our negotiating leverage is employed to the maximum, the Trade Representative will manage the negotiation of particular issues. Where appropriate, the Trade Representative may delegate responsibility for negotiations to other agencies with expertise on the issues under consideration. He will coordinate the operational aspects of negotiations through a Trade Negotiating Committee, chaired by the Trade Representative and including the Departments of Commerce, State, Treasury, Agriculture and Labor.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Trade Representative will be concerned not only with ongoing negotiations and coordination of specific, immediate issues, but also—very importantly—with the development of long-term United States trade strategies and policies. He will oversee implementation of the MTN agreements, and will advise the President on the effects of other Government policies (e.g., antitrust, taxation) on U.S. trade. In order to participate more fully in oversight of international investment and export financing activities, the Trade Representative will become a member of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Policies and the Boards of the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In performing these functions, the Trade Representative will act as the principal trade spokesman of the President. To assure that our trade policies take into account the broadest range of perspectives, the Trade Representative will consult with the Trade Policy Committee, whose mandate and membership will be expanded. The Trade Representative will, as appropriate, invite agencies such as the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to participate in TPC meetings in addition to the permanent TPC members. When different departmental views on trade matters exist within the TPC as will be the case from time to time in this complex policy area, I will expect the Trade Representative to resolve policy disagreements in his best judgment, subject to appeal to the President.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">the department of commerce</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Department of Commerce, under this proposal, will become the focal point of operational responsibilities in the non-agricultural trade area. My reorganization plan will transfer to the Commerce Department important responsibilities for administration of countervailing and antidumping matters, foreign commercial representation, and MTN implementation support. Consolidating these trade functions in the Department of Commerce builds upon an agency with extensive trade experience. The Department will retain its operational responsibilities in such areas as export controls, East-West trade, trade adjustment assistance to firms and communities, trade policy analysis, and monitoring foreign compliance with trade agreements. The Department will be substantially reorganized to consolidate and reshape its trade functions under an Under Secretary for International Trade.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With this reorganization, trade functions will be strengthened within the Department of Commerce, and such related efforts in the Department as improvement of industrial innovation and productivity, encouraging local and regional economic development, and sectoral analysis, will be closely linked to an aggressive trade program. Fostering the international competitiveness of American industry will become the principal mission of the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I580467" class="indent2 firstIndent-2 bold"><i>Import remedies</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I propose to transfer to the Department of Commerce responsibility for administration of the countervailing duty and antidumping statutes. This function will be performed efficiently and effectively in an organizational setting where trade is the primary mission. This activity will be directed by a new Assistant Secretary for Trade Administration, subject to Senate confirmation. Although the plan permits its provisions to take effect as late as <date date="1980-10-01">October 1, 1980</date>, I intend to make this transfer effective by <date date="1980-01-01">January 1, 1980</date>, so that it will occur as the new MTN codes take effect. Commerce will continue its supportive role in the staffing of other unfair trade practice issues, such as cases arising under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 [<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s2411">19 U.S.C. 2411</ref>].</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I580467" class="indent2 firstIndent-2 bold"><i>Commercial representation</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This reorganization plan will transfer to the Department of Commerce responsibility for commercial representation abroad. This transfer would place both domestic and overseas export promotion activities under a single organization, directed by an Assistant Secretary for Export Development, charged with aggressively expanding U.S. export opportunities. Placing this Foreign Commercial Service in the Commerce Department will allow commercial officers to concentrate on the promotion of U.S. exports as their principal activity.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Initially, the transfer of commercial representation from State to Commerce will involve all full-time overseas trade promotion and commercial positions (approximately 162), responsibility for this function in the countries (approximately 60) to which these individuals are assigned, and the associated foreign national employees in those countries. Over time, the Department of Commerce undoubtedly will review the deployment of commercial officers in light of changing trade circumstances and propose extensions or alterations of coverage of the Foreign Commercial Service.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I580467" class="indent2 firstIndent-2 bold"><i>MTN implementation</i></p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am dedicated to the aggressive implementation of the Multilateral Trade Agreements. The United States must seize the opportunities and enforce the obligations created by these agreements. Under this proposal, the Department of Commerce will assign high priority to this task. The Department of Commerce will be responsible for the day-to-day implementation of non-agricultural aspects of the MTN agreements. Management of this function will be a principal assignment of an Assistant Secretary for Trade Policy and Programs. Implementation activities will include:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">monitoring agreements and targeting problems for consultation and negotiation;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">operating a Trade Complaint Center where the private sector can receive advice as to the recourse and remedies available;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">aiding in the settlement of disputes, including staffing of formal complaint cases;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">identifying problem areas for consideration by the Trade Representative and the Trade Policy Committee;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">educational and promotion programs regarding the provisions of the agreements and the processes for dealing with problems that arise;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">providing American business with basic information on foreign laws, regulations and procedures;</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">consultations with private sector advisory committees; and</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I22" class="indent1">general analytical support.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">These responsibilities will be handled by a unit built around the staff from Commerce that provided essential analytical support to STR throughout the MTN negotiation process. Building implementation of MTN around this core group will assure that the government’s institutional memory and expertise on MTN is most effectively devoted to the challenge ahead. When American business needs information or encounters problems in the MTN area, it can turn to the Department of Commerce for knowledgeable assistance.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Matching the increased importance of trade in the Department’s mission will be a much strengthened trade organization within the Department. By creating a number of new senior level positions in the Department, we will ensure that trade policy implementation receives the kind of day-to-day top management attention that it both demands and requires.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">With its new responsibilities and resources, the Department of Commerce will become a key participant in the formulation of our trade policies. Much of the analysis in support of trade policy formulation will be conducted by the Department of Commerce, which will be close to the operational aspects of the problems that raise policy issues.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">To succeed in global competition, we must have a better understanding of the problems and prospects of U.S. industry, particularly in relation to the growing strength of industries abroad. This is the key reason why we will upgrade sectoral analysis capabilities throughout the Department of Commerce, including the creation of a new Bureau of Industrial Analysis. Commerce, with its ability to link trade to policies affecting industry, is uniquely suited to serve as the principal technical expert within the Government on special industry sector problems requiring international consultation, as well as to provide industry-specific information on how tax, regulatory and other Government policies affect the international competitiveness of the U.S. industries.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Commerce will also expand its traditional trade policy focus on industrial issues to deal with the international trade and investment problems of our growing services sector. Under the proposal, there will be comprehensive service industry representation in our industry advisory process, as well as a continuing effort to bring services under international discipline. I expect the Commerce Department to play a major role in developing new service sector initiatives for consideration within the Government.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">After an investigation lasting over a year, I have found that this reorganization is necessary to carry out the policy set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">section 901(a) of title 5</ref> of the United States Code. As described above, this reorganization will increase significantly our ability to implement the MTN agreements efficiently and effectively and will improve greatly the services of the government with regard to export development. These improvements will be achieved with no increase in personnel or expenditures, except for an annual expense of about $300,000 for the salaries and clerical support of the three additional senior Commerce Department officials and a non-recurring expense of approximately $600,000 in connection with the transfers of functions provided in the plan. I find that the reorganization made by this plan makes necessary the provisions for the appointment and pay of a Deputy Secretary, an Under Secretary for International Trade, and two additional Assistant Secretaries of the Department of Commerce, and additional members of the Boards of Directors of the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">It is indeed appropriate that this proposal follows so soon after the overwhelming approval by the Congress of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 [<ref href="/us/usc/t19/s2501">19 U.S.C. 2501</ref> et seq.], for it will sharpen and unify trade policy direction, improve the efficiency of trade law enforcement, and enable us to negotiate abroad from a position of strength. The extensive discussions between Administration officials and the Congress on this plan have been a model of the kind of cooperation that can exist between the two branches. I look forward to our further cooperation in successfully implementing both this reorganization proposal and the MTN agreements.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I am submitting herewith to the Congress Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1980, under authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act of 1977 (Chapter 9 of Title 5 of the United States Code). The Plan is designed to strengthen management of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in order to foster safety in all of the agency’s activities.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The need for more effective management of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been amply demonstrated over the past year. The accident at Three Mile Island one year ago revealed serious shortcomings in the agency’s ability to respond effectively during a crisis. The lessons learned from that accident go beyond crisis management, however. They provide the impetus for improving the effectiveness of all aspects of the government regulation of nuclear energy.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In my statement of <date date="1979-12-07">December 7, 1979</date>, I responded to the recommendations of my Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island and set forth steps now being taken to address those recommendations. I stated that I would send to Congress a Reorganization Plan to strengthen the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s ability to regulate nuclear safety. I am submitting that Plan today.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Plan clarifies the duties of the Chairman as principal executive officer. In addition to directing the day-to-day operations of the agency, the Chairman would take charge of the Commission’s response to nuclear emergencies and, as principal executive officer, would be guided by Commission policy and subject to Commission oversight.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">management problems</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Intensive investigations undertaken since the Three Mile Island accident have revealed management problems at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These problems must be rectified if the Commission is to be a strong and effective safety regulator.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—My Commission, called the Kemeny Commission after its Chairman, Dr. John Kemeny, concluded that the underlying problem at Three Mile Island stemmed not from deficient equipment but rather from compounded human failures. This included the inability of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to pursue its safety mission effectively in view of its existing management policies and practices. The Kemeny Commission reported a lack of “closure” in the system to ensure that safety issues are raised, analyzed and resolved. Kemeny Commission members also concluded that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission relies too heavily on licensing, and pays insufficient attention to ensuring the safety of plants once they are in operation.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—During the course of its investigation, the Kemeny Commission found serious managerial problems at the top of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It noted that the Commissioners and the Chairman are unclear as to their respective roles. Uncertain, diffuse leadership of this kind leads to highly compartmentalized offices that operate with little or no effective guidance and little coordination.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—A recently completed independent study authorized and funded by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission itself also found serious fault with the Commission’s management and called for a major organizational overhaul. The report states that there is no authoritative manager but, instead, five equally responsible Commissioners who deal individually with office directors who, in turn, head their own “independent fiefdoms.”</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I34" class="indent2 firstIndent-1">—Likewise, a recent report of the General Accounting Office notes the failure of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to define either the authority of the Chairman or that of the Executive Director for Operations. The staff lacks policy guidance and top management leadership to set priorities and resolve safety issues. There are unreasonable delays in developing policies to guide the licensing and enforcement activities of the agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The central theme in all three of these studies is the failure of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to provide unified leadership and consistent direction of the agency’s activities. The present statutes contain conflicting and ambiguous provisions for managing the agency. Important corrective actions cannot or will not be taken by the Commission until the laws are changed. Failure to do so constitutes a continuing nuclear safety hazard.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The present Reorganization Plan would improve the effectiveness of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by giving the Chairman the powers he needs to ensure efficient and coherent management in a manner that preserves, in fact enhances, the commission form of organization.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">commission</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the proposed Plan, the Commission would continue to be responsible for policy formulation, rulemaking and adjudication as functions which should have collegial deliberation. In addition, the Commission would review and approve proposals by the Chairman concerning key management actions such as personnel decisions affecting top positions which directly support Commission functions, the annual budget, and major staff reorganizations. In carrying out its role, the Commission would have the direct assistance of several Commission-level offices as well as the licensing board, the appeal panel, and the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards. The Plan would not alter the present arrangement whereby the Commission, acting on majority vote, represents the ultimate authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and sets the framework within which the Chairman is to operate.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">chairman</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Under the Plan, the Chairman would act as the principal executive officer and spokesman for the Commission. To accomplish this, those functions of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission not retained by the Commission would be vested in the Chairman, who is currently coequal with the Commissioners in all decisions and actions. The Chairman would be authorized to make appointments, on his own authority, to all positions not specified for Commission approval and would be responsible to the Commission for assuring staff support by the operating offices in meeting the needs of the Commission. The Executive Director for Operations would report directly to and receive his authority from the Chairman. Heads of operating offices would also report to the Chairman or, by delegation, to the Executive Director for Operations. Office heads would also be authorized to communicate directly with members of the Commission whenever an office head believed critical safety issues were not being addressed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">emergency management</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s ability to respond decisively and responsibly to any nuclear emergency must be fully ensured in advance. Experience has shown that the Commission as a whole cannot deal expeditiously with emergencies or communicate in a clear, unified voice to civil authorities or to the public. But present law prevents the Commission from delegating its emergency authority to one of its members. The Plan would correct this situation by specifically authorizing the Chairman to act for the Commission in an emergency. In order to ensure flexibility, the Chairman would be permitted to delegate his authority to deal with a particular emergency to any other Commissioner. Plans for dealing with various contingencies would be approved by the Commission in advance. The Commission would also receive a report from the Chairman or his designee describing the management of the emergency once it was over.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">actions not included in this plan</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Not included in this Plan are two actions that I support in principle but that need not or cannot be accomplished by means of a Reorganization Plan. First the Commission, as part of its implementation of this reorganization, can and should establish an internal entity to help oversee the performance of the agency as it operates under the Chairman’s direction. This action does not require a Reorganization Plan. Second, I have consistently favored funding assistance to intervenors in regulatory proceedings. This is particularly important in the case of nuclear safety regulation. I therefore encourage the Commission to include consideration of intervenor funding as part of its review and upgrading of the licensing process, as called for by the Kemeny Commission. I have also requested Congress to appropriate funds for this purpose. This activity cannot be authorized by a Reorganization Plan.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">no added costs</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">This proposed realignment and clarification of responsibilities would not result in an increase or decrease of expenditures. But placing management responsibilities in the Chairman would result in greater attention to developing and implementing nuclear safety policies and to strict enforcement of the terms of licenses granted by the Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would also accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in <ref href="/us/usc/t5/s901/a">5 U.S.C. 901(a)</ref>. No statutory functions would be abolished by the Plan; rather they would be consolidated or reassigned in order to improve management, delivery of services, execution of the law, and overall operational efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">By Executive Order No. 12202, dated <date date="1980-03-18">March 18, 1980</date> [<ref href="/us/usc/t42/s5848">42 U.S.C. 5848</ref> note], I established a Nuclear Safety Oversight Committee to advise me of progress being made by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the nuclear industry, and others in improving nuclear safety. I am confident that the present Reorganization Plan, together with the other steps that have been or are being taken by this Administration and by others, will greatly advance the goal of nuclear safety. It would permit the Commission and the American people to hold one individual—the Chairman—accountable for implementation of the Commission’s policies through effective management of the Commission staff. Freed of management and administrative details, the Commission could then concentrate on the purpose for which that collegial body was created—to deliberate on the formulation of policy and rules to govern nuclear safety and to decide or oversee disposition of individual cases.</p>

<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0"><inline class="small-caps">The White House</inline>, <date date="1980-03-27">March 27, 1980</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I74" class="centered smallCaps">Message of the President</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I33" class="indent0 firstIndent0">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">I herewith transmit the following amendments to Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1980, which I sent to the Congress on <date date="1980-03-27">March 27, 1980</date>.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The amendments to Reorganization Plan No. 1 are consistent with my original intent of strengthening the management of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in order to improve safety in all of the agency’s activities, while preserving the advantages of the Commission form. The amendments reinforce the purpose of the Plan in two respects. First, the amended Plan gives the Commission a greater role in selection of key program officers of the agency by adding four positions to the list of appointments initiated by the Chairman for the Commission’s advice and consent. These are the Executive Director for Operations, the Director of Inspection and Enforcement, the Director of Nuclear Regulatory Research, and the Director of Standards Development. Each of these positions contributes to nuclear safety regulation, and each performs functions that help determine the policy and performance of the agency.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards advises the Commission as a whole. Since its members serve renewable 4-year terms another amendment provides that a Commission member, as well as the Chairman, can initiate an appointment to the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards for approval by the Commission.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">As a means to ensure that the flow of information to the Commission will not be restricted, the Plan has been amended to make explicit that the Chairman, and the Executive Director of Operations through the Chairman, shall keep the Commission fully and currently informed.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">The second general purpose of the amendments is to provide for more effective management of the agency by making more explicit the responsibilities of the Chairman and the Executive Director for Operations acting under his direction. As amended, the Plan charges the Chairman with planning for the development of policy for consideration and approval by the Commission. In the past, this responsibility has not been clearly fixed and has consequently been neglected. The amended Plan continues to make clear that the Executive Director for Operations reports to the Chairman. An amendment, however, requires the Chairman to delegate to the Executive Director for Operations the authority to appoint the staff and the day-to-day administration of the agency. Under this arrangement, the Chairman retains responsibility for the delegated functions but will be better able to handle his other leadership tasks.</p>
<p style="-uslm-lc:I21" class="indent0">In summary, the amendments I am transmitting to Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1980, based on review and hearings conducted by the Congress and on continued consultations, will help establish a more accountable central management structure for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as it pursues its statutory objective of ensuring safety in the use of nuclear power.</p>
